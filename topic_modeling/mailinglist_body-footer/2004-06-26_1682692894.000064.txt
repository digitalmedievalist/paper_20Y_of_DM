standards community. a colleague of mine with whom i work regularly on 
web development always complains about non-IE browsers, and 
particularly mac versions, but he knows that the real problem is that 
IE does its own thing.i like your twist, dan, on the 80/20 rule, and would add that many web 
developers (like my colleague) develop for IE, which is to say that 
they develop *specifically* for IE. i'm doing some web-work with said 
colleague, now, and i can't properly use the pages i'm working on 
except in IE. those developers ultimately reinforce microsoft's bad 
standards behavior along with that of surfers who must use IE to 
properly access those sites.it's a bad cycle: i can (or even should) design/develop for IE since 
that's what most people use, which then drives ever more people to IE.this crew probably know most of the usual suspects on standards, but 
see, among many possibilities:
http://www.webstandards.org/and on IE and microsoft specifically, an essay recently posted there:
http://www.designbyfire.com/000099.htmlperhaps the response among this group should be the converse of many 
web developers: develop standards-based texts and applications and 
require your users to use standards-based browsers. iirc, that's what 
http://www.alistapart.com/ does. as dan notes, it's not like there 
aren't plenty of those browsers out there. and as martin points out, 
even if IE is parsing XSL better right now, other browsers, 
particularly mozilla-based browsers, are sure to catch up. that's the 
thing, in the end: if you develop documents to standards, you can be 
sure that browsers developing to standards will render your documents.not to preach to the choir, or anything.j--
