More information: clarin(a)clarin.euSpecial feature of this workshop: a mix of "Twin Talks" and "Teach Talks"This workshop is special in that part of the submitted talks at this workshop=
 are submitted and presented by, a humanities researcher and a digital expert=
 (the Twin Talks). They report on the research carried out together, both fro=
m their individual perspective (either humanities research or technical), as =
well as on their collaboration experience. Another part of the talks (the Tea=
ch Talks) are talks by people with experience or interesting ideas about how =
cross-discipline collaboration is or can be addressed in curricula or other t=
raining activities.+ Why two types of talks?The main objective of the workshop is to get a better understanding of the dy=
namics on the Digital Humanities work floor where humanities scholars and dig=
ital experts meet and work in tandem to solve humanities research questions. =
The best way to do this seems to be to give both parties the opportunity to p=
resent their achievements and to share their collaboration experiences with t=
he audience. The insights gained should help those involved in the education =
of humanities scholars, professionals and technical experts alike to develop =
better training programmes.As the problem of cross-discipline collaboration is not new we also invite th=
ose who have relevant experience or interesting ideas about how to address th=
is in university or other curricula to share their ideas with the audience.+ Who should submit?For the Twin Talks: Pairs of a humanities and a digital expert who have done =
joint research and who want to report on their work and on their collaboratio=
n experience.
For the Teach Talks: People (not necessarily in pairs) with relevant experien=
ce in or ideas about how to address cross-discipline collaboration in univers=
ity or other curricula.+ Why should you submit and/or attend?Humanities research can only benefit maximally from new developments in techn=
ology if content and digital experts team up, very similar to the hard scienc=
es where research is done in teams working on a specific problem, where every=
body brings in his/her specific content and technical expertise and skills.Co-design, co-development and co-creation are the rule rather than the except=
ion, but very little is known about how this collaboration works in practice =
and how better training and education of both humanities scholars and digital=
 experts could facilitate the way they collaborate. This is what this worksho=
p wants to address, based on real life collaboration examples. We especially =
invite researchers, professionals, educators, and RIoperators with a special =
interest in creating the conditions where humanities scholars and technical e=
xperts can fruitfully collaborate in answering humanities research questions.+ Format of the workshopThe half-day workshop will start with an invited talk, followed by 15-minute =
Twin Talks or Teach Talks, each followed by 5 minutes for questions and discu=
ssion. The Twin Talks should contain the following three components: presenta=
tion of the humanities problem and its solution, presentation of the technica=
l aspects of the research done, and a report on the collaboration experience =
itself, including obstacles encountered and recommendations how better traini=
ng and education could help to make collaboration more efficient and effectiv=
e. After the talks there will be a round table discussion with all participan=
ts to formulate the lessons learned from the presentations, and to identify f=
urther steps that could be taken.+ Research and teaching topicsAll humanities research topics in a very broad sense are welcome, where we ex=
plicitly include social sciences and cultural heritage studies. Research or t=
eaching activities may be completed or ongoing, as long as the presentation e=
xplicitly addresses the way the humanities researcher and the digital expert =
have collaborated or still collaborate.What we expect from the submissions for the Twin Talks track- They are authored and presented by one or more humanities scholars and one =
or more digital experts
- They start from a humanities research question (i.e. not a technical questi=
on, a presentation of a tool, a platform or a data collection)
- They describe the research carried out jointly and its results
- They describe the technical aspects of the methods used and the results obt=
ained
- They analyse the way the scholar and the technician collaborated, addressin=
g issues such as (but not limited to):
- - What was easy and what was difficult and why?
- - How did the researcher and technician change each other's way of looking =
at things?
- - Did they, for instance, make each other aware of blind spots they had?
- - Did the combination of thinking from a DH research question and thinking =
from a technical solution lead to new insights?
- - How could better training or education of scholars and digital experts ma=
ke collaboration easier, more effective and more efficient?+ Submissions for the Teach Talks trackOne single author and presenter is sufficient, but multi-author papers are of=
 course equally welcome.+ Submission instructions- Format: PDF. For format instructions, see: https://www.springer.com/gp/comp=
uter-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines
- Size: Extended abstracts, size ca 2000-4000 words, covering research questi=
ons and answers, technical aspects and collaboration experience for Twin Talk=
s, or relevant education experience for Teach Talks
- Publication: The workshop proceedings will be included in the proceedings o=
f the main DHN2020 conference
- Submission URL: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dtwintalksdh2020+ Important dates- Thursday, May 7 2020: Submission deadline
