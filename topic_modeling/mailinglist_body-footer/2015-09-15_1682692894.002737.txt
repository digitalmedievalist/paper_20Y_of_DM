Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit8th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the
Digital AgeNovember 12-14, 2015 Picking Up the PiecesIn partnership with the Rare Book Department
<https://libwww.freelibrary.org/rarebooks/index.cfm>  of the Free Library
of Philadelphia, the Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies (SIMS
<http://schoenberginstitute.org/> ) at the University of Pennsylvania
Libraries is pleased to announce the 8th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg
Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age. This year's theme,
"Picking up the Pieces," considers the notions and consequences of
fragmentation and reconstitution. When books are broken up, collections
dispersed, or a society's intellectual heritage is fragmented by time,
nature, and human interventions, the act of piecing together the remains
can lead to surprising insights about how and why books--the artifacts of
our intellectual heritage--were produced, collected, and saved in the
first place. Our aim is to examine various facets of the fragmentation of
books, collections, and cultural heritages in literal, metaphorical, and
philosophical terms. The topic also allows us to consider how the
processes of both physical and virtual reconstitution inform our
understanding of these artifacts and our relationship to them. The program begins Thursday evening, November 12, at the Free Library of
Philadelphia, Parkway Central Library, with our keynote speaker Nicholas
Pickwoad, Director of Ligatus <http://www.ligatus.org.uk/> , a research
center of the University of the Arts London with projects in historical
libraries and archives, and a leading authority on the conservation and
history of bookbindings. The symposium continues, November 13-14, at the
Kislak Center of Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts at the
University of Pennsylvania Libraries, with papers and workshops that delve
into various aspects of fragmentation and reconstitution. The symposium
will end with a roundtable discussion led William G. Noel, Director of
SIMS, and  Brian C. Rose, James B. Pritchard Professor of Archaeology,
Professor of Classical Studies at the University of Pennsylvania on the
historical, social, and political consequences of fragmentation and
reconstitution in the cultural heritage sector. For more information and to register, go to:
