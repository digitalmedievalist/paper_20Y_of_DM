recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) for encoding of
digital text. It combines in-depth coverage of the latest version of
the TEI Recommendations for the encoding of digital text with
practical workshops on related technologies. It includes an
introduction to mark-up, explanations of the TEI Guidelines, and
approaches to publishing TEI texts. Practical exercises expose you
hands-on experience of a wide range of TEI customisation, editing, and
publication.Each day will also include a number of afternoon 2.5 hour parallel
workshops on related technologies and topics. These will include TEI
Publishing; TEI for Language Resources; Transforming TEI with XSLT;
TEI in Libraries; Creating a TEI-based Website with the eXist XML
Database; and Genetic Editing: transcribing documents, transcribing
the process. There will also be optional surgery sessions for those
who wish to consult with TEI(a)Oxford about their particular projects or
encoding issues. There will also be guest lectures from Digital
Humanities experts familiar with the TEI talking about their own
projects, including C. Michael Sperberg-McQueen (co-editor of the XML
Spec and one of the founding editors of the TEI).If you are a project manager, research assistant, or encoder working
on any kind of project concerned with the creation or management of
digital text, this course is for you!The course runs from Monday 12 July – Wednesday 14 July, 2010. The
course runs from 09:30 – 17:30 each day in our fully-equipped computer
training rooms. Lunch and refreshments are included in the course fee.Questions about booking on the workshop: courses(a)oucs.ox.ac.ukDr James Cummings
