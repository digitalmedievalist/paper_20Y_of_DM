(Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval, University of 
Massachusetts Amherst): http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/irdemo/hw-demo/ Not 
medieval however.See for another approach: 
http://www.ai.rug.nl/alice/nwo-catch-scratch/index_english.html. From 
that page: For one thing, the massive amount of text images of 
handwritten pages will allow for the exploitation of modern statistical 
techniques. Data mining techniques such as clustering will uncover 
regularities in handwritten shapes that may act as the bridge to 
document retrieval and text analysis. In this project we will not aim 
for a veridical left-to-right transcription of handwritten documents: 
this would be an unrealistic target. Alternatively, at the end of the 
project, we will have delivered tools for keyword-based search in 
handwritten archives, akin to existing flat-text search methods 
("Googling").Peter--===============8615896400297307934==--
