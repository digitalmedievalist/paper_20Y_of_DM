	I'm writing to encourage members of the list to add to Wiki entries
anything useful or interesting they see on, receive from, or contribute
to the list. To name some recent examples: if you are the member of a
project, institute or organisation, please consider adding a brief
profile (see http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Projects for other
examples); if you know or learn of a special font or tool, consider
adding a page about it or adding to a relevant existing entry; if you
see a term or acronym you didn't understand, consider adding an entry on
it once you know what it means.Adding to the Wiki is really quite a quick and simple process
(especially after you've tried once) and it is difficult for much to go
wrong: we can undo any changes (you can do so yourself), and a couple of
us keep track of all changes to the wiki to look for formatting errors,
etc. we can repair.The goal here is not to add a burden to posters to the list (we are all
busy people and don't necessarily have the time to answer questions
twice). But the Wiki is in some ways intended to serve as the collective
intelligence of the community. Just as on other lists, poster often post
summaries of replies they receive to questions, on this list, you can
post answers to the Wiki.Any attention you can devote to this, is very much appreciated.-d
