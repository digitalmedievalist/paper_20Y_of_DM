isn't in Safari yet). This authentication is used for access to Windows 
servers on the network which are using Windows authentication, so it's 
really a case of the Mozilla guys being pragmatic and offering this 
convenience to users who regularly have to operate in Windows environments. 
Presumably Apple will eventually do the same for Safari, given the effort 
they've already put into making OSX work well in Windows-dominated 
environments.Cheers,
