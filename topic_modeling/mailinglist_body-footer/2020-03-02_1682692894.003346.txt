ennsylvania Libraries is accepting applications for its 2020-2021 Visiting Re=
search Fellowship program. Guided by the vision of its founders, Lawrence J. =
Schoenberg and Barbara Brizdle Schoenberg, SIMS aims to bring manuscript cult=
ure, modern technology, and people together to provide access to and understa=
nding of our shared intellectual heritage. Part of the Penn Libraries, SIMS o=
versees an extensive collection of premodern manuscripts from around the worl=
d (https://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren), with a special focus on the his=
tory of philosophy and science, and creates open-access digital content to su=
pport the study of its collections. SIMS also hosts the Schoenberg Database o=
f Manuscripts (https://sdbm.library.upenn.edu/) and the annual Schoenberg Sym=
posium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age (http://www.library.upenn.edu=
/about/exhibits-events/ljs-symposium).The SIMS Visiting Research Fellowships have been established to encourage res=
earch relating to the premodern manuscript collections at the University of P=
ennsylvania Libraries, including the Schoenberg Collection. Affiliated with t=
he University of Pennsylvania, located near other manuscript-rich research co=
llections (the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropol=
ogy, the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Science History Institute, and the=
 Rosenbach Museum and Library, among many others), and linked to the local an=
d international scholarly communities, SIMS offers fellows a network of resou=
rces and opportunities for collaboration. Fellows will be encouraged to inter=
act with SIMS staff, Penn faculty, and other medieval and early modern schola=
rs in the Philadelphia area. Fellows will also be expected to present their r=
esearch at Penn Libraries either during the term of the fellowship or on a se=
lected date following the completion of the term.Applicants can apply to spend 1 month (minimum of 4 work weeks) at SIMS betwe=
en July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021. Applications are due May 15, 2020. For mo=
