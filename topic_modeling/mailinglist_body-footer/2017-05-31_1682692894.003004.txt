rspectiveLinked Data connects digital objects based on common features, and has the po=
tential to transform Ancient World research; however, this approach is still =
not widely used, and my research explores why this might be the case. This pa=
per explains how I converted publicly-available data on AHRC-funded projects =
to Linked Data, facilitating detailed queries to identify potential case stud=
ies. I will discuss several of these (Pelagios 4, SNAP:DRGN, and STAR, STELLA=
R and SENESCHAL) from a user perspective, as well as evaluating the usability=
 of the linked AHRC data. Additionally, I will present my initial findings an=
d their potential implications for future projects.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2017-01sm.htmlALL WELCOMEValeria Vitale
