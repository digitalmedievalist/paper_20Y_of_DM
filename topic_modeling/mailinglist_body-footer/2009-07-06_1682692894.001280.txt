red (Photoshop, Gimp, etc.) while everything else (non-neutral) was
colored blue. Then, looking at the image through standard red/blue 3D
glasses, the palimpsest popped off the page. This is a poor man's
version of multi-spectral imaging and it depends on the possibility of
isolating one layer of ink by color, but it was surprising how well it
worked!Jesse
