Senior researcher fellowship: "Digital scholarly editing and memory
institutions"The Swedish School of Library and Information Science (SSLIS) at the
University of Borås (http://www.hb.se/en/), Sweden, is offering a Marie
Curie funded fellowship for an Experienced Researcher in the DiXiT
project (Digital Scholarly Editions Initial Training Network,
http://dixit.uni-koeln.de). The position is full-time, with a
fixed-term employment for 12 months, starting March 1 2016, and located
at SSLIS.Description:
The study of this Experienced Researcher project aims to critically
explore the range of measures and methods for establishing
trustworthiness, quality parameters and authenticity of digital
reproductions in libraries and archives, particularly by looking at
cases where levels and measures are negotiated between such memory
institutions and external agents hired to perform parts of the process.
The results of such negotiations might have significant bearing on the
value of the digitized resource, and the level of post-processing work,
use and re-use that can be performed with the digitized material within
digital edition projects and other scholarly work. How and to what
extent are these measures and methods maintained consistently throughout
projects versus being renegotiated, possibly affecting the scholarly
value of the digitized resource?Formal requirements:
Within DiXiT, the applicant for the position of Senior Researcher
must:
- be in possession of a doctoral degree or have at least four years of
full-time equivalent research experience.
- also have less than five years of full-time equivalent research
experience.
- be fluent in English.There is also a mobility rule within the DiXiT project which means that
the applicant of the position as Senior Researcher at SSLIS must not
have resided or carried out his/her main activity (work, studies etc) in
the country of his/her host organization (Sweden) for more than 12
months in 3 years immediately prior to his/her recruitment. Short stays,
such as holidays, are not taken into account.Professional qualifications:
- Relevant doctoral degree (or at least four years of research
experience, see above)
- Prior experience with digitization, digital scholarship, scholarly
editing.Application deadline: December 1, 2015Full position announcement and instructions for applicants can be found
