are adding significant intellectual work, and not obviously reproducing
the text of the dictionary. If you are dealing with a whole bunch of
dictionaries, then you are certainly on safe ground, I'd guess. If you
are reproducing just one, then you might be in more trouble, though I'd
guess not, since the lemma list is not the point of your collection.
Presumably an index is similar to a concordance.-dOn Tue, 2006-06-06 at 10:36 -0400, Dot Porter wrote:
