Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts Sponsored Session
at the 52st International Congress on Medieval Studies
Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, May 11-14, 2017We seek proposals for the following session:
Networks of Transmission: Histories and Practices of Collecting Medieval Manu=
scripts and DocumentsThis session will focus on the mapping of those networks of sale and purchase=
 through which medieval manuscripts have been pursued and on the collectors a=
nd collecting that have catalyzed this transmission across the centuries. Thi=
s session - like The Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts itself - is rooted in=
 the belief that studying manuscripts' provenance can have dynamic and profou=
nd effects not only on our understanding of these medieval materials as objec=
ts to be bought and sold but also on their texts through mapping their circul=
ation and reception. We particularly welcome proposals that explore diverse t=
opics from the role of digital technologies such as the SDBM in conducting pr=
ovenance research, the relationship between institutional and private ownersh=
ip of manuscripts, specific case studies of collecting practices, the transat=
lantic travels of medieval materials, collectors' roles in the dispersal of l=
ibraries and the fragmentation of manuscripts, collectors and manuscript pres=
ervation, and how a manuscript's provenance history can affect its value and =
collectability on the rare books market, to how collectors and the act of col=
lecting can shape and influence interpretations of manuscript evidence.
Please send proposals with a one-page abstract and Participant Information Fo=
rm (www.wmich.edu/medieval/congress/submissions/index.html<http://www.wmich.e=
du/medieval/congress/submissions/index.html>) to Lynn Ransom (lransom(a)upenn=
