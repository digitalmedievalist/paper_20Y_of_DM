s part of the training activities of the PARTHENOS project.=20The PARTHENOS e-Humanities and e-Heritage Webinar Series provide an opportuni=
ty to explore the new possibilities arising from the digital and infrastructu=
ral developments in the Humanities and Cultural Heritage research. The series=
 will act as a lens through which a more nuanced understanding of the role of=
 Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage Research Infrastructures for resear=
ch can be gained. The webinars are aimed mainly at Digital Humanities and Cul=
tural Heritage practitioners who wish to learn how to maximise their benefits=
 and cooperation with Research Infrastructures.The webinar series evolves from user and partner feedback on the PARTHENOS tr=
aining strategy and subject matter. Starting from the researchers' pe=
rspective, the individual webinars will focus on the role of Research Infrast=
ructures in the individual phases of the research life cycle  and on the enga=
gement in Research Infrastructures in general. Each webinar of the PARTHENOS =
e-Humanities and e-Heritage Webinar Series has an individual focus and can be=
 followed independently.About the intended audience:=20This webinar series is aimed at Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage prac=
titioners who wish to learn how to optimally benefit from and cooperate with =

ht into humanities and cultural heritage related aspects of digital research =
