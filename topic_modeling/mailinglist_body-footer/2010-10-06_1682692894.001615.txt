tying a piece of information to an absolute physical location is normal and
necessary.  The proliferation of devices and systems right now is just
opening our eyes to the fact that this isn't the case.I hope we'll ultimately move (revert?) to citing based on how the content is
structured--chapter & verse, so to speak--rather than how any one device
(including a particular edition of a book) displays it.Paragraph, word, and/or character counters should be built into all epub
readers and other tools used to display electronic publications!  You'd
still depend on your device to *tell* you the location, of course, but
that's not the same as having the device *determine* the location. If the
content remains the same from format to format and version to version, the
612th paragraph of chapter 10 should always be the same.Not that this helps your student today.
