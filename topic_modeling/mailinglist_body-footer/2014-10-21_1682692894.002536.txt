ging (RTI) files of the 8th-century St Chad Gospels available for viewing on =
the Web: https://lichfield.as.uky.edu . This past summer, I used RTI (origina=
lly known as Polynomial Texture Mapping, PTM) to capture dry-point glosses an=
d the state of pigments in the 8th-century St Chad Gospels. RTI proved wonder=
fully successful, even capturing dry-point glosses that had previously gone u=
nnoticed. These files are viewable in a regular browser and allow viewers to =
control the angle of light and adjust a specular enhanced view of surface det=
ails. I also have a short video about RTI and the Chad Gospels' dry-point glo=
sses on the website, but it is also viewable directly on YouTube: http://yout=

Bill--
