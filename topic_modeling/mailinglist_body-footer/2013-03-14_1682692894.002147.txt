digital editions are not more popular with both authors and readers, some
of which are touched on in the article:
- Compared to a printed book, they're miserable to read, since they tend to
be designed first for technical analysis, and any attention to typography
is typically a very low priority. (Granted, this is a problem with most
e-books.)
- There's no guarantee in many cases that citations made from digital
editions will be stable.
- It's far easier to put a good printed edition together than a good
digital edition, especially because of the lack of standard, user-friendly
tools.
- There is no standard way of presenting online critical editions (whereas
most printed texts are published in series that follow a style guide).
- Delving into academic politics, publishers hate them and many
universities don't count digital projects toward tenure.None of these problems are insurmountable, and most have been tackled
already by someone, but I'm really looking forward to a solution that at
least tackles the technical aspects of these problems.Andrew Dunning
