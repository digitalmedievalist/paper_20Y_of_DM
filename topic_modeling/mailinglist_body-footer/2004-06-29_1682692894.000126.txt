The thing that would be=20
most helpful, actually, is a universally accepted "controlled=20
vocabulary" for paleographic description, either verbal or in terms of=20
graphical metrics (or ideally both), on which we could build descriptive=20
structures in XML or whatever. I don't think paleographers are close to=20
having that.
**********Last year I went through the introductions to several Old English facsimiles =
(Vercelli Book, Hatton 20, Junius 11, Royal 7 C xii; and Ker's Catalogue - wh=
atever was easily available at UK) in an attempt to glean such a controlled v=
ocabulary. It was an interesting experience - paleographers seem to have diff=
erent terms to describe the same forms, and I found that many terms were rath=
er vague and only made sense when I actually saw the letter in question (asce=
nder "rises well above the bow" or "projects slightly to the left"). And thes=
e lengthy descriptions are not always suitable as markup.Dot***************************************
