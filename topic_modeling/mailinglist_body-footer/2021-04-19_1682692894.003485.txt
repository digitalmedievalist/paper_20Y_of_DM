The Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies is pleased to announce the ne=
xt installment of the SIMS Virtual Lecture Series:
Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations: Symbolizing the Elements That Cr=
eate Manuscripts and Their Structural History with VisColl 2.0Presented byAlberto Campagnolo, University of Udine
Dot Porter, Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies, Penn Libraries Friday, April 23, 2021, 1:00 -2:15pm (via Zoom)
The ultimate working unit of the codex is the gathering structure known as th=
e quire, a group of folded (or single) leaves bound together with other quire=
s to form the text block. This structure, characterized by a limited number o=
f elements and variations in their spatial arrangement, is fundamental to the=
 study of the codex format for manuscript books. Traditionally, gathering str=
uctures are described in highly formalized alphanumerical formulaic represent=
ations, referred to as collation formulas. It is customary to include these f=
ormulas in paper-based and online catalogues. For what concerns manuscript st=
udies, however, there are no actual standards, and different catalogues and s=
cholars use their own set of rules and practices, making broader analysis dif=
ficult. In addition, the information density of collation formulas hinders th=
e immediacy of their interpretation.In this lecture, creators Dot Porter, SIMS founding member and Curator of Dig=
ital Research Services, and Alberto Campagnolo, book conservator and adjunct =
professor at the University of Udine, will present a new version of the onlin=
e collation modeler VisColl to address these challenges. VisColl 2.0, with it=
s new interface VCEditor, has been updated to model complex structures, with =
quires, subquires, and a variety of attachment methods, also through an intui=
tive graphic interface that guides the user and permits data input without kn=
owledge of the XML data model behind it.This event is free and open to the public. To receive the zoom link, click on=
