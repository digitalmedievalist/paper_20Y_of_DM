subject of a thread by you on dm-l. Sorry I didn't see it earlier (and
forgot that this had come up).I've spent the day playing with it, and I must say it looks pretty good:
the format is more or less as detailed as ProCite (which seems to be
better than end note), and it does everything one might want. It took a
bit of work to import ProCite without losing information (the output
styles they want you to use have terrible information loss), but onceI
built a Procite > RefWorks stylesheet it went really well.Apart from the fact that it is totally non-standards based (but then
reference managers don't seem to have an official standard as far as I
can tell), it seems really good.It seems to have the same, or perhaps slightly better, field division
than refdb (refdb.sourceforge.net), and I've never been able to get
refdb working right. I'm off to try wikindx now.-dOn Tue, 2006-21-02 at 19:23 -0700, Jesse Hurlbut wrote:
