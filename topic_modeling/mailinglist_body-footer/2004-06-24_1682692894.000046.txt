Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitIt seems to me that Peter Baker has indicated the real value of XSLT in this
context: that it can be used for on-the-fly presentation or preprocessing,
as appropriate. The real limited resource in this kind of work is not
storage space or processing capacity but my ability to learn new languages.
Since this is an area where the scholars are also building the tools, it
makes a lot of sense to keep the toolkit as simple as possible.Peter> -----Original Message-----
