Of course, you have a point there: typesetting is a job on its own.
Although, there are occasions on which you might want to handle the=20
multiple layers of footnotes: either when you have to prepare the=20
camera-ready file without the help of a professional typesetter (I know=20
many students, for instance, who have to use LaTex for the critical=20
edition included in their thesis, just to obtain the mandatory multiple=20
layers), or also when you simply want to have a "cleaner" apparatus for=20
your own use on a "work-in-progress" critical edition.Marjorie
