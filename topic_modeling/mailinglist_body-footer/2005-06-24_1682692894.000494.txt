still catching up on mail after a month-and-a-half-long absense.  But
I did notice one thing:  generally, "TEI" and "XML" have been used
interchangeably.The two are not equivalent; TEI is an initiative that has guidelines,
and is not a markup language.  Nor is "semantic encoding" (which is at
least partly what we're really talking about when we discuss digital
editions) equivalent to "XML."  It is quite possible to create, say, a
digital edition of a literary work without looking at the TEI
Guidelines at all.  In order to allow it to "talk" with other
editions, and with some emerging tools, the creators might want to
then translate it -- not "into TEI" but into another set of elements
and attributes, one that is in accordance with the TEI Guidelines.TEI has been absolutely essential in promoting dialogue and framing
our thinking about digitized texts, no doubt.  But it is not essential
for doing humanities computing, or for encoding, just like a food
processor is not essential for making bread.I'm not qualified to speak to other issues raised in the thread (such
as the relative value of facsimile and/or encoded digital editions);
just wanted to point out what I see as a fairly major element in
understanding humanities computing.-Vika--
