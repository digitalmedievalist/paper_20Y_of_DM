	Does anybody know of a good method for form-based xml-file 
construction? I am looking for something to use on a local (winxp) machine.
	Like most people I have a number of files that are written either 
through accretion (e.g. like a CV) or that consist largely of boiler 
plate with minor customisation (e.g. class schedules, web-pages, etc.). 
I'm in the process of converting these to xml from various formats, as I 
hope to gain some real efficiencies.
	My question whether anybody can suggest a good method for adding marked 
up text to such files using a form. The CV is probably the best case: 
I'd like to have a form that allows me to read in the existing material, 
enter the new item, and have the expanded document as output.
	In the past I've used javascript and HTML forms to build standard 
webpages, and emacs form-mode to build simple form-based database entry 
mechanisms. Since I'm basically looking for a very simple way of adding 
markup to highly standard text, I'm trying to avoid using a spreadsheet 
as an intermediate. In fact I'm probably looking for a combination of 
the emacs-style forms (which import or create datafiles and allow users 
to easily update existing data) and a java-script type solution that 
allows me to add markup around form-field contents.
	Any suggestions?
