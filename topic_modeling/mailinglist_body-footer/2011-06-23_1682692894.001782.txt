I've been amused by one of the added topics at the BALISAGE conference=20
(see email below:"Why is XML a pain to produce?"I would be curious to know the fellow Digital Medievalists on that. Off=20
the top of my head, I'd say "because uit's semantic!"Any thoughts? :)
Best wishes, Marjorie

led, a few slots were reserved for presentation of "Late breaking" material. =
 These presentations have now been selected and added to the program.Topics added include:  -  XQuery and SparQL
  -  XQuery and XSLT
  -  the Logical Form of a Metadata Record
  -  Why is XML a pain to produce?
  -  XML Serialization of C# and Java Objects
  -  testing XSLT in continuous integration
  -  dealing with markup without using words
  -  REST for document resource nodes
  -  tagging journal article supplemental materials
  -  using 15 year old SGML documents in current softwareThe program already included talks about DITA, XSLT, generic microformats, XM=
L Ebooks, JSON, multiple hrefs, XML editors, markup overlap, encryption of XM=
L documents, and XML Interoperability, among others. Now it is a real must fo=
r anyone who thinks deeply about markup.Balisage is the XML Geek-fest; the annual gathering of people who design mark=
up and markup-based applications; who develop XML specifications, standards, =
and tools; the people who read and write, books about publishing technologies=
 in general and XML in particular; and super-users of XML and related technol=
ogies. You can read about the Balisage 2011 conference at http://www.balisage=
