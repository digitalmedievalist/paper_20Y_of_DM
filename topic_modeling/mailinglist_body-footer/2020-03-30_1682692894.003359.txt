theses. I had thought that the graphics and design students who create
their own fonts for their theses caused us difficulties, but this raises
things to a whole new level.I guess since it's a Unicode font we can still cut and paste the
fore-matter out of the PDF and into something sane to read it for
cataloging purposes?cheers
