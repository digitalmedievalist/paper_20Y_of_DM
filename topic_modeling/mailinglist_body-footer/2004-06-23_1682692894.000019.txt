Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableHello All,At last year's Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Member's Meeting, I (along with=
 Peter Robinson, and Patrick Durusau of the Society for Biblical Literature) =
convened a Special Interest Group on Overlapping Markup issues. We haven't do=
ne very much since then, unfortunately, but Patrick and I are slowly working =
on a web page that will highlight various different approaches to dealing wit=
h overlapping markup and conflicting hierarchies. I'll post an announcement h=
ere when the page goes live - it's good to see that folks are so interested i=
n this problem!There is also an overlapping markup listserv, to join go to http://listserv.b=
rown.edu/tei-ol-sig.html. (Also, if you're interested in reading the report f=
rom last year's meeting, you can find it here: http://www.tei-c.org.uk/Activi=
ties/SIG/Overlap/olm01.txt)Many thanks to Daniel et. al. for putting this listserv together!Dot Porter
