Travis's approach has worked best--with some little alterations mainly 
for making lines wrap elegantly and for working around problems with 
e-book readers. Here's the css:.verse-container div {margin-left: 7em; text-indent: -2em;}
.verse-container div span {display: block; float: left; margin-left: -5em;}
.hypermetric div {margin-left: 6em; text-indent: -2em;}
.hypermetric div span {display: block; float: left; margin-left: -4em;}I substituted div for p because Stanza insists on its own formatting for 
p. And I use em instead of px to scale better with the device.  The HTML 
looks like this:<div class="verse-container">
    <div>Oft him ānhaga     āre gebīdeð,</div>
    <div>Metudes miltse,     þēah þe hē mōdcearig</div>
    <div>geond lagulāde     longe sceolde</div>
    <div>hrēran mid hondum     hrīmcealde sǣ,</div>
    <div><span>5</span>wadan wræclāstas.      Wyrd bið ful ārǣd.</div>
</div>Nice and clean. The only remaining problem is that the Adobe Digital 
Editions (ADE) e-book reader doesn't move the left margin of the span as 
far left as the CSS tells it to do, and this causes collisions between 
line number and line in the hypermetric verses, where the left margin is 
narrower and there's less margin for error. So I've had to make the left 
margin wider than I had it before to compensate. It looks like a waste 
of space on an iPod screen, but in a browser window the spaciousness is 
rather pleasant.Grant Simpson's approach looked to be working well, but it ran afoul of 
a bug in the Stanza reader, which for some reason makes a block 
containing a line number disappear unless it is inside the div for the 
line. Don't ask me why: but as I've been haunting the mobileread forums 
for a couple of weeks I can say that the CSS processing in Stanza and 
ADE is well known to be flaky.I expect the e-book reader in the iPad to be much better, as it will 
presumably use the Safari layout engine.Thanks again to everyone,
