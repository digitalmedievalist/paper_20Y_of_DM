>> The workshop aims at bringing together researchers interested in historica=
l linguistics, who combine a solid linguistic background with an interest for=
 the exploitation of electronic resources, and in particular of syntactically=
 parsed corpora, in research on language change. We welcome proposals address=
ing diachronic issues under any type of approach and methodology, provided th=
at they highlight the contribution of empirical evidence retrieved from treeb=
anks in achieving meaningful results.

>> MOTIVATION AND AIMS
>> Over the last two decades, treebanks have become an increasingly useful in=
strument for data-driven study of linguistic structures at various levels. Th=
e proliferation of treebanks has led to a very large number of resources avai=
lable for different languages, which can support comparative research of vari=
ous issues cross-linguistically. In recent years, a growing number of treeban=
ks has also become available for ancient  languages and for different histori=
cal stages of the same language: the York-Toronto-Helsinki corpus (http://www=
-users.york.ac.uk/~lang22/YcoeHome1.htm) and the Penn Corpora of Historical E=
nglish (https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/) for English, Troms=C3=B8 Ol=
d Russian and OCS Treebank (https://nestor.uit.no) and RRuDi (https://www.sla=
wistik.hu-berlin.de/de/member/meyerrol/subjekte/rrudi) for Russian, PROIEL (h=
ttp://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/projects/proiel/) for various anci=
ent Indo-European languages and recently extended to host treebanks for medie=
val stages of Romance and Germanic languages, Perseus Latin and Ancient Greek=
 Dependency Treebanks (http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/) for Lat=
in and Ancient Greek, the Index Thomisticus Treebank (http://itreebank.margin=
alia.it) for Latin, and several others. This allows data extraction aimed to =
assessing the scope and the effects of diachronic developments, managing a la=
rge amount of data and retrieving information whose relevance can then be eva=
luated through statistical methods. Possible issues that can be tackled throu=
gh diachronic treebanks are potentially numerous and of different nature, and=
 include increasing or decreasing productivity of syntactic or morphological =
constructions, and, most interesting, interrelationships between different ch=
anges that have previously been considered unrelated or whose interrelation i=
s otherwise hard to prove.

>>=20
>> Possible TOPICS include (but are not limited to):
>>=20
>> - historical developments of constructions as evidenced by data extracted =
from diachronic treebanks;
>>=20
>> - suitability of different types of treebanks (constituent-based vs. depen=
dency-based) for research on specific diachronic changes;
>>=20
>> - correlations between developments in different areas of a language=E2=80=
=99s grammar;
>>=20
>> - similarities and differences between parallel developments of similar ch=
anges in different languages;
>>=20
>> - how evidence from already known and documented diachronic change can giv=
e input for annotation;
>>=20
>> - how semantic and/or pragmatic information can be supplied in order to be=
tter understand the rationale of changes highlighted by data extracted from t=
reebanks;
>>=20
>> - specific issues raised by the development of diachronic treebanks;
>>=20
>> - methods and tools to build and access diachronic treebanks;
>>=20
>> - issues in data selection for representativeness purposes;
>>=20
>> - issues pertaining to scarce and non-standardised data

>> CALL FOR ABSTRACTS
>>=20
>> We invite you to submit abstracts up to 300 words (references not included=
) describing original, unpublished research related to the topics of the work=
shop. Abstracts should be in an editable format (e.g. .doc or .docx; no pdf w=
ill be considered), and should be sent to all workshop organizers:
>>=20
>> - hanne.m.eckhoff(a)uit.no
>>=20
>> - silvia.luraghi(a)unipv.it
>>=20
>> - marco.passarotti(a)unicatt.it
>>=20
>> =20
>>=20
>> The DEADLINE FOR THE SUBMISSION of the short abstract is NOVEMBER 15, 2015=
. Abstracts will be evaluated by the convenors, and selected abstracts will a=
ccompany the workshop proposal. We will notify you of inclusion in the worksh=
op proposal when we submit it on Nov. 25th.=20
>> Note that if the workshop has been accepted, you will also have to prepare=
 a full abstract and submit it to be reviewed by the SLE scientific committee=
. The deadline for the submission of full abstracts is January 15, 2016.
