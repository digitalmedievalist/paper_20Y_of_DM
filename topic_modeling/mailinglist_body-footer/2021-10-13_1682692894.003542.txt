(owhlc.hypotheses.org<http://owhlc.hypotheses.org/>)Meeting 2021Brussels, KBR (Royal Library of Belgium), 23rd and 24th November 2021Organized by

[https://intranet.kbr.be/doc/logos/logoBelspoEN.jpg]Over the course of the Middle Ages and the first Renaissance, what was called=
 the 'Low Countries' (BeNeLux, Northern France, Northern-Western Rhine Region=
s) developed an original written culture. The essential part of what has been=
 preserved of this important heritage has fortunately survived in the librari=
es and manuscript collections of our regions, sometimes abroad. Over the last=
 few years, important survey and recovery projects have been started. However=
, not all the heritage collections have been identified or explored, especial=
ly in the private and ecclesiastical libraries. Moreover, not all the pre-mod=
ern sources useful for the study of this written heritage have yet been ident=
ified, surveyed or edited.To facilitate these scholarly activities, we must call on information technol=
ogies and particularly on digital humanities for inventory, research, preserv=
ation and enhancement of this heritage. Relevant technologies include managin=
g metadata, digitization, electronic editions, data mining, virtual libraries=
 and virtual digital museology or digitally restoring medieval books. However=
, all these initiatives have not yet necessarily been surveyed, and they are =
still not all accessible from a central point of information. Moreover, many =
manuscripts and the relevant sources that document their history are still po=
orly known to scholars working in this field.It therefore seems timely and opportune to make an assessment of the initiati=
ves and to establish a research community around the written heritage of the =
historical Low Countries and the application of digital humanities to this fi=
eld. An 'observatory of written heritage', comparable to Biblissima  and in c=
lose collaboration with this pioneering French portal in the field, would be =
a good approach to creating a synergy between keepers of the historical colle=
ctions, expert librarians, academic scholars and teachers and digital humanit=
ies researchers.In order to launch this contact group's activities, a webinar has already bee=
n organized in May 2021. Now that the relaxation of the Covid-19 rules allow =
for in-person meetings, we are able to organize a meeting on 23rd and 24th No=
vember. This will not be a conference, but working groups deliberating on the=
 need of such a network, the expectations for it, and the possible activities=
 it could undertake in the next future.If you are a librarian, an archivist, a written heritage preservation or digi=
tization specialist, a Digital Humanities specialist, a researcher or a teach=
er involved in the field of written cultures of the area in question, and if =
you are a representative of your institution, unit, laboratory, etc., you are=
 friendly invited to participate in the working days (there may be several pa=
rticipants for each institution, depending on their skills).!!! Due to Covid health measures in Brussels-Capital Region, access might be =
made conditional on presentation of a 'Covid Safe Ticket' !!!REGISTRATION FORM <https://forms.gle/ksjh97nY9zVBhxpXA>
