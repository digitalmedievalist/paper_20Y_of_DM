been in the process for several months (well almost a year off and on)
of trying to build my own JSTOR: I've been scanning my collection of
article photocopies in and scanning them to PDF with OCR text
recognition. The actual process works well enough: the OCR is goodish
(about as good as JSTOR, probably), and the PDFs high enough quality.
The weak link is the automatic document feed on my HP 5590: it quite
frequently (maybe once per 5-10 batches of documents) takes two or three
sheets at a time. I keep it quite clean, BTW.What kind of ADF (Auto Document Feed) scanner would people recommend for
scanning and OCRing 1000 or so articles? While cost is obviously an
issue, I'm going to have to hire somebody to babysit the current setup,
so it may all balance out in the end. First prize to anybody who
suggests a completely Linux compatible solution. But I've also Windows
XP available.-d
