is functionally the same as Junicode for Windows/Linux, but perhaps a  
little easier to install, and tested in Mellel and XeTeX on the  
gorgeous MacBook that my department just bought for me. You must have  
OS X 10.4 ("Tiger")  or later if you want to see the pretty OpenType  
things.http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=158636Peter
