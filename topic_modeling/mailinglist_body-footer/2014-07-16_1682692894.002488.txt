Clotho: Network Analysis and Distant Reading on the Perseus Latin CorpusHow do we handle Latin texts with digital tools? How do we apply to 
Latin sources technologies and algorithms which have been developed for 
the linguistic study of modern languages? Clotho is a resource which 
aims to address these questions in an Open-Source format, providing 
network analysis, data extraction mechanisms, and document statistics. 
Using these tools, Lasciva Roma, a project of cultural network analysis 
around the lexical field of terms related to sexuality, was launched in 
2014. This seminar will explore and review this project, focusing on how 
the community can use these tools, and how to ensure the tools and the 
data will not be lost.ALL WELCOMEThe seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information see the seminar website at
