medieval scribal hands in digital fonts. My latest effort is a font 
called "Eadui," based on the hand of Eadui Basan, the head scribe at 
Christ Church, Canterbury, in the early eleventh century. It exploits 
OpenType features so as to avoid, so far as possible, the machined look 
of most "medieval" fonts. The better an application's support for 
advanced typography, the better this font will look. (Best: XeTeX or 
InDesign; good: iWork or Mellel; poor: OpenOffice.)The current version of Eadui is a beta. I will give a free copy of the 
final font, when it's ready, to anyone who downloads this and sends bug 
reports, feature requests or impressions. Get it here:http://faculty.virginia.edu/OldEnglish/junicode/eadui.htmlBest wishes to all,
