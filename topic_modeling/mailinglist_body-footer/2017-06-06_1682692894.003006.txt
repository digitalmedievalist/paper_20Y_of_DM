ital Age
November 2-4, 2017
Intertwined Worlds
In partnership with the Rare Book Department<https://libwww.freelibrary.org/r=
arebooks/index.cfm> of the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Schoenberg Insti=
tute of Manuscript Studies (SIMS<http://schoenberginstitute.org/>) at the Uni=
versity of Pennsylvania Libraries is pleased to announce the 10th Annual Lawr=
ence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age.Despite the linguistic and cultural complexity of many regions of the premode=
rn world, religion supplies the basis of a strong material and textual cohesi=
on that both crosses and intertwines boundaries between communities. This yea=
r's theme, "Intertwined Worlds," will highlight the confluence of expressions=
 of belief, ritual, and social engagement emerging in technologies and tradit=
ions of the world's manuscript cultures, often beyond a single religious cont=
ext. It will consider common themes and practices of textual, artistic, liter=
ary, and iconographic production in religious life across time and geography,=
 from ancient precedents to modern reception and dissemination in the digital=
 age.For more information, go to: http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/lectures/l=
