SPOT<https://historyspot.org.uk/podcasts>=E2=80=98The People of Medieval Scotland, 1093-1314' is a prosopograp=
hical
database that has
been in production since 2007, and has been freely available online since
the summer of 2010. Since the relaunch of the database last year, the site
has had over 40,000 unique visitors from across the globe. Now nearing
completion, the database contains records on over 20,000 individuals, drawn
from over 8500 medieval, mostly Latin documents. The paper will examine
some of the PoMS project's technical innovations as well as the new
directions we hope to take in the coming years.The seminar will take you behind the scenes of the public website to see
how this database evolved from the factoid prosopography model created for
the =E2=80=98Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England' (PASE) by John Bra=
dley of the
Centre for Computing in the Humanities, now Department of Digital
Humanities, at Kings College London. PoMS has developed what might be
called a =E2=80=98transactional model' of factoid prosopography, due =
to the fact
that it is comprised almost entirely of transactional documents like
charters. Rather than simply recording events, the transactional model is
explicitly interested in relations between individuals as recorded in the
documents. We will examine the new structures PoMS incorporates to allow
end users the ability to research the terms of the transaction, and thus
the nature of the interaction between people, as well as multiple
transactions happening at different times within the same document. We will
look at the work of Michele Pasin, formerly of DDH, in developing new ways
for users to both search and visualise these transactions. The seminar will
finish with a consideration of the capabilities of the database for
studying the social networks, and visualising the relationships between
large numbers of people.*Matthew Hammond* is a Research Associate in the School of Humanities at
the University of Glasgow and former Lecturer in Scottish History at the
University of Edinburgh. Since 2007, he has been a team member of the
AHRC-funded projects that created the =E2=80=98People of Medieval Scotland,
1093-1286' database (www.poms.ac.uk) and is now working on a
Leverhulme-funded project to expand the capabilities of that database,
especially in the area of Social Network Analysis.--===============1613999577845693192==
