Dear Prof. O'Donnell,This doesn't directly address your problem, but should get you around
it entirely: using the <video> tag, it's now possible to embed video
in a page without using the QuickTime plug-in. There's an excellent
discussion of this at <http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html>. There are
also pre-made video players using this technique at
<http://videojs.com/>, <http://mediaelementjs.com/>, and
<http://www.jplayer.org/>. In addition to having a working video
player, your video should be more compatible with future browsers, and
will also work on mobile devices.Hope that helps,Andrew Dunning
