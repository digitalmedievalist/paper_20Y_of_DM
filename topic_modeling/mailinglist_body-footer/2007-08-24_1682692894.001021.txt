The first seminar in this year's Humanities Computing series will take
place at 1pm on Thursday 30th August 2007 in the Seminar room, 1st 
floor, Kay House, 7 Arundel St; *** English Medieval Latin Charters: Attribution and Exploration through
textual analyses *** Dr Michael Gervers, University of Toronto
It is estimated that about a million charters survive as originals or 
copies from twelfth- and thirteenth-century England, the great majority
of which were issued without dates.The DEEDS Project, founded at the University of Toronto in 1975, has 
developed an XML encoded database of over 9,500 charters from c. 1100 
to 1310, dated either internally, or by an editor, to within a year of 
the actual date of issue. These conveyances have been extracted from 
over 190 printed sources, which in total contain over 100,000 
documents. Charter metadata includes chronological and topographical 
information, details of the religious house or lay household from which
the document came, and the roles, titles and social status of grantors 
and recipients.All are welcome!Each year the Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College 
London, presents a series of lectures and demonstrations by leading 
scholars, postgraduate students and practitioners from across the 
disciplines of the humanities and nearby social sciences. The series 
aims not only to present work at the leading edge of application but 
also to provide a forum in which this work is subject to critical 
reflection and thoughtful probing.----------------------------------------
