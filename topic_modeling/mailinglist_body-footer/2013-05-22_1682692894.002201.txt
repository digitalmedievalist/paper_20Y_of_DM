Interdisciplinary Digital Methods**Lancaster University, 15-18^th July, 2013*Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are becoming increasingly used by 
historians, archaeologists, literary scholars, classicists and others, 
however adoption of the technology has been hampered by a lack of 
understanding of what GIS is and what it has to offer to these 
disciplines. This free summer school, sponsored by the ERCÂ’s /Spatial 
Humanities: Texts, GIS, Places/ project and hosted as part of the 
/Lancaster Summer School in Interdisciplinary Digital Methods/ provides 
an introduction to the use of GIS software aimed specifically at 
researchers from the humanities and arts.*Outline syllabus:*The course will provide an introduction to GIS software and how it can 
be applied to humanities research.  The course assumes no prior 
knowledge of GIS software but a basic competence in computing is 
needed.  We will provide hands-on training in ArcGIS, the most widely 
used commercial GIS software package. Other software will also be 
discussed. Participants are encouraged to bring their own data with them 
(as text files, spread sheets, databases, images, or whatever other 
format) so that we can investigate using it within GIS as part of the 
course.*Who should come?*This will be relevant to post-graduate students and early career 
academics who can subsequently develop these skills in their own 
research.  This event will provide a detailed and intensive introduction 
to GIS software with the opportunity to work with your own data.  The 
summer school builds on a one-day seminar held in Lancaster in November 
2012.  People who participated in this are encouraged to attend although 
attendance at this or similar events is not a requirement.*How much will it cost?*Tuition at the summer school is free and includes refreshments. All 
other costs must be borne by the participants.  A list of possible 
accommodation is available from: 
http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/summerschool/travel.php. Please do *not* book 
this until your place on the summer school has been confirmed.*How do I apply?*Places are limited, as part of registering please include a brief 
description (max 200 words) of your research interests and what you want 
to gain from the workshop. *The* *deadline for applications is Sunday 
2^nd of June*.Please email a booking form (overleaf or at
