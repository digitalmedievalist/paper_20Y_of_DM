I find both positions (James Cummings, Martin Holmes) very close to each
other and to my own point of view. Would you agree if I describe them as
some sort of modern textual materialism, where the 'text' always is
something which is 'medialised' - which is an (digital) document rather
than an abstract idea? And on the other hand we would have 'data'
containing all the representational (and interpretative) information we
have about a 'text' - I would call this a 'transmedial' text. As I would
call the new media revolution a process of 'transmedialisation'.patrick[...]>> At 02:41 PM 29/06/2004, you wrote:
