(for directions see http://atm.kcl.ac.uk/location)Neil Fraistat, University of MarylandIn association with arts-humanities.netWhat is the function of the digital humanities center within a rapidly=20
changing humanities landscape? Although they have a great capacity for=20
focusing, maximizing, and networking local knowledge, local resources,=20
and local communities of practice, digital humanities centers are also=20
at risk of being silos, overly focused on their home institutions,=20
rarely collaborating with other centers, and unable to address by=20
themselves the larger problems of the field. They also siphon off grant=20
funding from schools unable to afford a digital humanities center of=20
their own and can make it harder for scholars at such places to=20
participate in the larger projects that help to shape the possibilities=20
and future of the field. Are digital humanties centers crucial to the=20
future of the field, or deleterious to it? Or to point the question more=20
finely: in what ways and under what circumstances might digital=20
humanities centers be seen as more crucial to the field than=20
deleterious? I'll be discussing these issues especially in terms of the=20
centerNet initiative, which seeks to create a truly global network of=20
local digital humanities centers.
