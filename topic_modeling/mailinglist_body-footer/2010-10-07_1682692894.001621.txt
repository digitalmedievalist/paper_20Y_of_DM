Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableIMO, the chief issue (although not the original question that launched the th=
read) is not whether it is possible to cite something with no pagination (or =
no date) -- because, yes, it always has been possible -- but whether there is=
 a more useful way to cite current electronic publications that have some sor=
t or another of "location" information already in them, as well as what would=
 be useful ways to design (leaving aside the technical implementation conside=
rations) the marking locations and/or sections in the contents in electronic =
publications without fixed pagination (because it is most useful to be able t=
o use citation information to actually locate the contents to which the autho=
r intended to refer).Cheers,
