Medievalist Journal. This issue is opened by Ludger Zeevaert's "Easy 
tools to get to grips with linguistic variation in the manuscripts of 
Nj√°ls saga". As within the past, we are operating a policy of rolling 
release meaning that more contributions will be published during the 
course of the year.Enjoy reading: http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/Kind regards,
