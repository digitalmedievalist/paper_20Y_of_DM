this kind of project. We've got lots of CDs purchased in the '90s on our
shelves, that are now unusable due to deterioration of the media or
obsoleteness of the platform. Anything that depends on current browsers will
suffer the same fate before many more of us have tenure. An online source,
with institutional backing that ensures it will stay online and be
maintained as technology changes, is much to be prefered. I'd be willing to
sacrifice a lot of functionality for the sake of permanence, since the
functionality will evaporate anyway with the next generation of browsers.
The ongoing institutional support has to be sufficient to re-engineer the
project from time to time to keep it working with new browsers and other
tools as yet unimagined, which is no small commitment. It makes sense
therefore to avoid doing one-off development and instead develop standard
tools and protocols for presenting these projects. Peter Binkley
