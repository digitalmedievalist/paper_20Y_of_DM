://zenodo.org/communities/dmwr/?page=3D1&size=3D20>, called the Digital Medie=
val Webinar Repository (DMWR) to house recorded presentations on medieval top=
ics, especially those that include digital work. We already have several vide=
os posted and ready for the community to access, and invite additional submis=
sions to our growing collection.As we launch this initiative, we hope to demonstrate the power of the DMWR fo=
r both scholars who have given virtual presentations at conferences or other =
organized venues, and for organizations who have hosted medieval scholarly pr=
esentations and recorded those events.When scholars post to the DMWR community, they are following the best practic=
es for digital preservation that encourage storing materials in multiple loca=
les. Moreover, the retrieval and citation of a scholar's work is facilitated =
by the generation of a DOI and standard citation of the recorded presentation=
, and other members of the community can see, access, and search for their wo=
rk within the curated collection.When organizations post in the DMWR, they ensure the safekeeping of their con=
tributors' work and create a public recall to the sponsored event. Contributi=
ons include a reference to the event for easy discovery, and should the organ=
ization's site ever fail, event participants can rest assured that back-up co=
pies are stored in the DMWR collection for easy retrieval.The DMWR program is a win-win; the community benefits by having a central loc=
ation where materials of interest to medievalists are stored, and scholars an=
d organizations can feel confident that others can find, access, and cite the=
ir recorded work appropriately.Cataloguing a recording is a simple affair, and once the materials are gather=
ed, it should take no longer than 10 minutes. Each contribution requires thre=
e things:1. An MP4 file of the recording;
2. A transcript of the presentation in pdf format (automatically generated in=
 youtube, for example);
3. All standard bibliographic information to generate the citation and tag th=
e recording.Members of the Digital Medievalist Board are happy to answer questions for po=
sters. Uploading to Zenodo is not all that complicated, but please do reach o=
ut if there are problems or concerns.Thank you for your support of the Digital Medievalist, and please feel free t=
o circulate this call to anyone who might find it of interest.
