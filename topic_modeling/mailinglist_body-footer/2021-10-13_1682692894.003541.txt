owledge database. This database contains information about all surviving and =
identified early medieval manuscripts transmitting the Etymologiae of Isidore=
 of Seville, fully or partially. Today, I am glad to inform you that the fina=
l version of the database was released at: db.innovatingknowledge.nl<http://d=
b.innovatingknowledge.nl/>. Introduction to the database and explanatory text=
s can be found at the Innovating Knowledge website<https://innovatingknowledg=
e.nl/?page_id=3D33>.This final version describes 478 manuscripts, giving us for the first time a =
good overview of how popular and widespread work the Etymologiae was in the e=
arly Middle Ages. It is almost certainly not the final count as new witnesses=
 of Isidore's text from the early Middle Ages continue to be identified. The =
database can be, hopefully, curated for at least a few more years and new man=
uscripts can be added to it. If more funding can be secured for the database,=
 one day it can be hopefully expanded to contain also post-1000 manuscripts o=
f the most important medieval Latin encyclopaedia.The final version of the database also contains images of 270 of the manuscri=
pts. As a novel feature, the database has an integrated Mirador viewer, which=
 allows you to open and browse through all manuscripts equipped with a IIIF m=
anifest (there are 264 of them) directly via the database. We also improved o=
ur free text search and filters and added two new formats (XML and Excel) to =
download options.Together with the database, the project also releases the data behind the dat=
abase for reuse by other projects. They can be found here<https://zenodo.org/=
record/5564441>.I sincerely hope the Innovating Knowledge database will be a welcomed additio=
n to the tools available to the Digital Medievalist community. We at the Inno=
vating Knowledge project also welcome any tips for new manuscripts to include=
 into the growing list of early medieval witnesses of the Etymologiae and als=
o any corrections and additions of the extant entries in the database.Best wishes,Evina Steinova
