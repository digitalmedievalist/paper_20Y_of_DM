Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableI think the only caveat that needs to be mentioned in all this is that=20
the location of the journal is not a fully autonomous decision--or at=20
least if it is, it potentially involves giving up as much as $7k+ a year=20
in in-kind and cash funding.Currently the journal is managed within the Lethbridge journal=20
incubator. This is a start up Open Access publisher that provides about=20
$7k in in-kind funding in the form of managing assistance plus some cash=20
for odd jobs.This has been by no means perfect--we had an assistant dean try to kill=20
it this past year before she fully understood just how strongly her=20
boss, the dean of the graduate school, stood behind it. The result was=20
that she severely restricted our access to funds for several months=20
until we were able to get her countermanded. And, frankly, we also had=20
trouble finding the right balance in relations between the students we=20
had been able to supply and the editorial board.The first of these issues has now been cleared up: we've been promised=20
four positions a year for the foreseeable future and the incubator is=20
moving from a prototype to an official and centrally supported Centre=20
within the University in the course of the next six months.The second certainly improved somewhat during the past year, though that=20
has been with me largely acting as the graduate student, since the=20
previous student quit in the face of the pressure she was placed under=20
(when a grad student turns down 7k, you know there is an issue).All this, however, is by-the-by. The issue now is whether the=20
contribution from us is worth continuing and, if it is, how our ability=20
to deliver it is affected by the system DM moves to (unlike all other=20
journals in the system DM doesn't contribute anything back to the=20
incubator, except, I had originally hoped, some willingness to help=20
train the students in it).Another thing that I have suggested to the board is that there is a lot=20
of hype around various platforms. While they can definitely be an=20
improvement over DM's current handrolled site, they are often far less=20
comprehensive than their developers claim. Stock OJS, for example,=20
builds itself as a all-in-one solution, but it is actually a very heavy=20
workflow manager and publication platform that doesn't necessarily=20
support two essential aspects of DM's production: despite what many=20
people seem to think, it does not support at all the=20
word-processor-to-delivery-format conversion that lies at the heart of=20
any journal (though a recent module apparently supports Word-to-NLM=20
XML). It also needs to be hacked severly to support DM's model of=20
rolling release with special clusters: stock OJS sees "issues" (i.e.=20
clusters of papers) as a sequence and its automatic Table of Content=20
generator doesn't allow two issues to be kept open at the same time=20
(Digital Studies/Le champ Num=C3=A9rique, which takes a similar approach to=20
issues as DM, but within OJS, has had to give up on the TOC generator=20
entirely. Its front page is actually hand coded). A study by the Public=20
Knowledge Partnership OJS's developer actually suggested, moreover, that=20
the OJS workflow model may be better suited to larger journals than very=20
small ones like DM.I understand that the core of revues.org is based on a modified OJS=20
install. I don't know if it now supports automatic word to XML=20
conversion (it didn't when we initially set up the Journal of the TEI)=20
nor do I know if it has addressed the structural issue about how OJS=20
handles issues. But what we did learn in setting both J-TEI up in=20
revues.org and DSCN in an inherited OJS install was that both systems=20
over-promised and under-delivered on what was the bit of the production=20
workflow that people found most technically challenging.So research is absolutely required on this: I know of a couple of=20
journals that switched to OJS because they thought it would address=20
technical issues they were having, only to discover it solved everything=20
but those technical issues. On the other hand, both systems are a vast=20
improvement over the current in terms of improving discoverability.Anyway, this is a long way of saying that, having been involved now with=20
at least four journals and professionally engaged as a researcher and=20
member of the administration of force11.org, I've come to the conclusion=20
that changing any journal's delivery, production, and workflow=20
management systes can prove to be a very complicated undertaking. I=20
agree wholeheartedly that it is time to reexamine what DM is doing. But=20
I also know that people regularly under-estimate and misunderstand what=20
the issues are, that systems that support journals (including, I=20
acknowledge this past year, the incubator) regularly over-promise what=20
they can do, and that the implications of the decision can be quite=20
significant from both a funding and a bibliographic perspective.Having said all that, I will add that my one feelings about changing the=20
journals are limited to a hope that the change is well-researched and=20
fully understood, no matter what it is. If that means keeping the=20
journal within our financing and management model, which is certainly=20
compatible with OJS or home-rolled systems (the three journals we=20
currently host use two completely different home-rolled systems and one=20
OJS install), I'm all for it. If it means abandoning the current=20
incubator model, I'm cool with that too. The important thing is that=20
people realise the costs and benefits of whatever is proposed.-danOn 14-05-27 10:10 AM, Dot Porter wrote:
