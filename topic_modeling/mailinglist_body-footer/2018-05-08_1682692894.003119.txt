project is funded by the Laureate Scheme of the Irish Research Council
and led by Dr Jacopo Bisagni.The IrCaBriTT project will explore the intellectual exchanges between
Ireland, Brittany and Francia during the Carolingian age (c. AD
750–1000). More specifically, the project will assess the impact of the
literary and scholarly heritage of early Christian Ireland on the
shaping of textual and cultural identity among the intellectual élite of
medieval Brittany, a country situated on the frontier between the
Insular world and the European mainland.Position for postdoctoral researcher:The central task associated with this Research Post will consist in the
transcription, critical editing and thorough study of the substantial
(and hitherto completely neglected) collection of Latin biblical glosses
found in Orléans, Bibliothèque Municipale, 182, an early 10th-century
manuscript copied in a Frankish scriptorium (probably Fleury-sur-Loire)
from a lost Breton exemplar.To find out more about the position, including how to apply, go to the
