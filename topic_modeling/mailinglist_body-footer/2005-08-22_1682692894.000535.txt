education?  These tasks are basic computer literacy which has little 
to do with 'Humanities Computing' per se.  Almost every university in 
the UK has some provision for IT training should students require it. 
  Even at the University of Manchester where you are students can take 
courses via the IT Services:
http://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/trainingcourses/Surely what you should be doing on any course which requires basic IT 
skills (or heaven forfend more advanced skills!) is stating this as a 
prerequisite and directing students to the IT Services to receive 
training in these skills.If teaching a course (say on use of XML for producing critical 
editions or general text encoding) I don't think that we should feel 
any compunction in listing basic familiarity with HTML as a 
prerequisite, as long as students have access to training in that 
area.  (I'm not suggesting you say they must have taken specific 
course X, simply that they are aware that it is a prerequisite and so 
they should have learnt it somewhere.)It just seems to be an inefficient waste of resources for us to 
duplicate training that is already available to most students.  Great, 
offer topics which use a higher level of technology to drive the 
learning process, but where it isn't the end in itself (teaching 
palaeography on computer is a good example of this).  If increasingly 
all the interesting courses list 'At least basic computer literacy' as 
a prerequisite then students will start to make sure they have these 
skills.But of course, I was using mainframes at the age of 8, so my 
perspective may vary from yours. ;-)-James
