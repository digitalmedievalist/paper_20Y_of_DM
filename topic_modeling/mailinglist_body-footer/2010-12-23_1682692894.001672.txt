http://www.textgrid.de/en/newsletter.htmlIn June 2011 TextGrid is going to present a stable Version 1.0 which is
intended to be productively used in research projects. In this context we
will organize the TextGrid-Tage 2011 (TextGrid Days) at GÃ¶ttingen on 12/13
July, where lectures, tutorials and workshops will take place.The newsletter addresses the following topics:
* Roadmap for Version 1.0
* TextGrid-Tage on 12/13 July, 2011
* Press Kit with InterviewsThe joint project TextGrid aims to support access to and exchange of data in
the arts and humanities by means of modern information technology (the
grid). In 2006 development began on a web-based platform, one which will
provide services and tools for researchers for analysis of text data in
various digital archives - independently of data format, location and
software. TextGrid serves as a virtual research environment for
philologists, linguists, musicologists and art historians.This newsletter is a joint effort of all TextGrid partners. You can
subscribe to it on the TextGrid website
(http://www.textgrid.de/en/newsletter/subscribe.html). This page also
contains an archive of past newsletters
(http://www.textgrid.de/en/newsletter/archive.html).Yours Sincerely,
The TextGrid Team--===============1501681687627821582==--
