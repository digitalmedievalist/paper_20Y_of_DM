Subject: Extreme pre-conference workshop on overlap
=20
What:   International Workshop on Markup of Overlapping Structures=20        XML and SGML have revolutionized the representation of
        structured information, but not all information structures
        map
        easily into systems of hierarchically nested elements. Markup
        of overlapping structures is a perennially hot topic,
        reinvented and reimagined as often as it is solved.        This full-day workshop will bring together the proponents of
        some of the major proposals for markup, representation,
        extraction, display, and validation of semantic overlap to
        summarize the systems they are developing and discuss topics
        of common interest. A morning of formal presentations will be
        followed by an afternoon of free-ranging discussion.When:   Monday, 06 August 2007=20
        the day before Extreme Markup Languages 2007,
