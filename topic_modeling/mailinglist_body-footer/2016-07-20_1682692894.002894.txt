due Sept. 15, 2016.CFP: Technical Communication in the Middle Ages
International Congress on Medieval Studies (Kalamazoo, 2017)
Proposals due: September 15, 2016
Submit to Wendy Hennequin (mwhennequin(a)gmail.com)Scholars have long recognized Chaucer's =E2=80=9CTreatise on the Astr=
olabe=E2=80=9D as an
early technical document, yet relatively few medieval texts have been
discussed as specimens of technical communication. This session seeks to
consider the traditions and conventions of medieval technical
communication, as well as the connections between medieval and contemporary
technical writing.Possible texts for consideration might include (but are not limited to)
penitential and conduct manuals, monastic rules, business correspondence,
medical treatises, scientific and pseudo-scientific manuals (including
alchemical and astrological ones), cookery books, law codes, and government
and military documents. Papers should consider the texts as technical
communication, but may focus on any aspect, including writing, layout,
design, etc.Please submit proposals to Wendy Hennequin (mwhennequin(a)gmail.com) by
September 15, 2016.--=20
