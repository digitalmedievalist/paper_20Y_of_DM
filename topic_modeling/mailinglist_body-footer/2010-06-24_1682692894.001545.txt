nominees.I'm off the board this year and have decided not to run again. I've enjoyed
participating in DM officially and really look forward to being an active
voluneer (as you may note, with my recent queries to the listserv re:
organizing sessions, DM mentoring, and a lunch at DH. Speaking of which -
don't hesitate to contact me or the list if you are interested in any of
those initiatives!)Thanks,
