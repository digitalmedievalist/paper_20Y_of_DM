<http://pennpaleography.wordpress.com/>*Sponsored by SIMS (The Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies),
University of Pennsylvania*=C2=B6 *Thursday 8th May, 10am (Session 22 ~ Schneider 1140)This workshop will provide a space for discussing the methodology and
practice of paleography in Manuscript Studies and the value of
collaborative reading. Rather than a Paleography 101-style workshop, we are
eager both to share our experience and to seize the opportunity to open up
a larger conversation about paleography with a particular focus on the use
of innovative new digital tools and online resources such as Penn in
Hand<http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/index.html>and
T-PEN <http://t-pen.org/TPEN/>. Topics to be considered may include: how
using digital resources has altered our group's methods of accessing
premodern scripts (from written texts and glosses to handwritten addenda
and later annotations in early printed books); the dynamics of practicing
paleography as a group; and how we can create possibilities for
collaborative, interactive transcription.The workshop will consist of three sections:I.  A series of =E2=80=98lightning presentations' by group members on=
 selected
premodern manuscripts from Penn's Special Collections, including
manuscripts from our newly-acquired Schoenberg
Collection<http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/search.html?fq=3Dcollectio=
n_facet%3A%22Lawrence%20J.%20Schoenberg%20Collection%22&rows=3D100>.
II.    Discussion of the paleographical challenges presented in these and
other manuscripts.III.  A general discussion section open to all attendees in which we
encourage questions about the what, why, and how of paleographical study.We encourage attendees to bring their own paleographical problems for
consideration by all workshop participants. If you have a paleographical
challenge that you would like to share in the workshop (preferably
accompanied by jpg files of the pertinent folios of your Ms.), it would be
helpful for you to contact us in advance, although you are of course very
welcome to simply bring your challenges on the day.
** All Are Welcome! No Registration Required **However if you would like to confirm your interest in participating in this
workshop or to contact us with details of your paleographical problems,
please e-mail Alexander Devine at aldevine(a)sas.upenn.edu.
