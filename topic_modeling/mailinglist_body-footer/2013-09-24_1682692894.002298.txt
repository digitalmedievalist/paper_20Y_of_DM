All the best,
Valentina AsciuttiAbstract:
According to Bourdieu, the value of art, literature, etc is a form of belief =
that is produced within the cultural field and then propagated outwards into =
wider society through public-facing cultural institutions - as in the case of=
 the 'writer's writer' who is initially read only by his or her peers, but wh=
o becomes 'consecrated' (i.e. canonised) thanks to peer esteem and eventually=
 finds a mass readership through school or university syllabi. In this talk, =
I shall lay out two innovative methodologies for studying these processes thr=
ough social network analysis. This is potentially controversial because of Bo=
urdieu's much-discussed preference for Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Howe=
ver, I shall argue that, just as the abstract mathematical space of Multiple =
Correspondence Analysis forms a useful analogue for Bourdieu's conception of =
field, the no-less abstract structure of a directed graph forms a useful anal=
ogue for his understanding of the production of value within a field, and of =
its subsequent propagation beyond that field.
The first of the methodologies I shall present focuses on the production of v=
alue. It has already been trialled through a case study of interactive fictio=
n, with results of this investigation to appear in my monograph, Literature i=
n the Digital Economy (forthcoming from Palgrave, 2014), and elsewhere. As I =
will argue by reference to ongoing research, the same methodology can potenti=
ally yield important insights when applied to other cultural forms.
The second of these methodologies focuses on the propagation of value, and th=
us provides a possible approach to the study of the impact of the arts on wid=
er society, as well as a bridge between the two major strands of research in =
the sociology of culture, i.e. study of cultural producers and study of cultu=
ral consumers. It builds on the first methodology but presents arguably great=
er difficulties with regard to data collection and the interpretation of find=
ings. However, these difficulties are instructive because they raise deep que=
stions about the use of social network analysis in cultural research, both in=
 the humanities and in the social sciences.Speaker's Bio:
Daniel Allington is a lecturer in the Open University Centre for Language and=
 Communication. His first book, Communicating in English: Talk, Text, Technol=
ogy (co-edited by Barbara Mayor) was published by Routledge in 2012. His firs=
t monograph, Literature in the Digital Economy, is forthcoming from Palgrave =
Macmillan in 2014. He researches the production, circulation, and recognition=
 of value in a range of cultural practices, from literature and visual art to=
 computer programming, focusing in particular on the construction and mainten=
ance of hierarchies and inequalities, and on the quest for autonomy among cul=
tural producers of all kinds. Daniel's website is at http://<http://www.danie=
