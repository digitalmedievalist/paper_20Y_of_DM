Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThe discussion of Junicode and fonts raises a very important
issue in making medieval resources available on the web.Using Junicode or another font created with the right
unicode glyphs in is great if you can make sure your
users viewing the pages have that font and are in fact
using it to view these pages.I've seen all sorts of solutions from the bad to
not-so-bad but never really seen one that doesn't
have some limitations somewhere.Of course the inevitable future tense of computing
means that when everyone is using browsers which
support CSS3's "webfonts" then this won't be as much
of a problem.  (This is a way to have the browser
download the font on the fly if it does not already
have a copy of it.)At the OTA we are primarily concerned with freely
archiving electronic texts for long term preservation
and so are able to store unicode character entities with
less worries about how actually to display them for
users.  (Side note: If you have electronic medieval
editions of texts and want free archiving of them for
posterity, please see
http://www.ahds.ac.uk/litlangling/depositing/index.htm
for more information.)So what is best? Obviously encoding your webpages as
(say) UTF-8 is a good start.  Force user to download a
font for your site with appropriate glyphs?  Use images
of the glyphs instead of actual characters(*shudder*)?
Transliterate into ascii characters/editorial marks? Use
markup to allow easy replacement of different solutions
on the fly?I have my own preferences but am interested in what
other people have done.-James---
