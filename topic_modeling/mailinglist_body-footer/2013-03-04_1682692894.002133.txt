for the French national library, which refused some years ago to
participate n the Google Books projectpartly because of the exclusive
commercial use, and founded the first version of Europeana, with an intense
activity of digitization of its holdings (more than 2 million documents on
gallica.bnf.fr)French lawyers and librarians comment on the role of a commercial branch
BnF-Partenariats in the lazy negociation on public access (at least within
the whole country), cf.

a long term strategy in order to (commercially) exploit the (partly public
domain) cultural heritage.DominiqueM. Dominique Stutzmann
