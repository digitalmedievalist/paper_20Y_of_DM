Manuscript Studies brings together scholarship from around the world and acro=
ss disciplines related to the study of pre-modern manuscript books and docume=
nts. This peer-reviewed journal is open to contributions that rely on both tr=
aditional methodologies of manuscript study and those that explore the potent=
ial of new ones. We publish articles that engage in a larger conversation on =
manuscript culture and its continued relevance in today's world and highlight=
 the value of manuscript evidence in understanding our shared cultural and in=
tellectual heritage. Studies that incorporate digital methodologies to furthe=
r understanding of the physical and conceptual structures of the manuscript b=
ook are encouraged. A separate section, entitled Annotations, features resear=
ch in progress and digital project reports.For more information and to subscribe, go to http://mss.pennpress.org. For di=
rect inquiries, please don't hesitate to contact the editors at sims-mss(a)po=
