es of COST Action IS 1005, =E2=80=98Medioevo Europeo: Medieval Studies and Te=
chnological Resources'.
Codicology, the study of manuscript books as material objects, is an importan=
t discipline within manuscript studies. Topics covered will include writing m=
aterials, formats and layout, with particular focus on presenting a typology =
of medieval manuscripts, illustrated by Bibles, manuscripts of the Latin clas=
sics and literary and legal manuscripts in the vernacular. A significant comp=
onent of the school will be instruction in the use of TEI-conformant XML to r=
ecord and analyse codicological data. There will also be a presentation of Ma=
nuscripta mediaevalia, a joint online venture of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berl=
in, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek München and the Deutsches Dokumentations=
zentrum für Kunstgeschichte - Bildarchiv Foto Marburg, which gives acces=
s to the manuscript collections of hundreds of libraries in Europe and the Un=
ited States.
