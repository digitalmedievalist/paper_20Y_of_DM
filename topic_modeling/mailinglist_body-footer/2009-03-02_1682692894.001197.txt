standards they've passed on. This is going to be very helpful. And I=20
appreciate any others: I'll be putting together suggestions for the=20
committee next weekend.I found this "driver's licence" interesting, as indeed Lou's comments=20
about the change coming with the arrival of more digital natives. I have=20
been deeply impressed in the last year or two at the on-going changes in=20
how our students work with computers. I think we really are just now=20
getting first years who really can't imagine what it was like without=20
the net, computers, and social networking. Even our fourth year students=20
seem less native in their interactions.The range between basic desktop apps and dbms is what we are trying to=20
negotiate here. I'm thinking the answer might be to have a "driver's=20
licence" type course as something that many students who are not=20
interested in adding an informatics component to their degrees might=20
find useful. And I am still amazed at how shallow some of the student's=20
knowledge of basic office software really is.But for the larger programme in informatics, it is exactly the issues=20
Lou mentions at the end that are the skills we're considering:> knowing about the hardware? programming? project management? systems=20
> analysis and database design
The goal is that in a programme of eight or nine semester-long, North=20
American style 3-credit courses, our students would graduate with an=20
understanding of how ICT can be applied to research questions in their=20
home domain, have some experience analysing information flow, in project=20
management, HCI, and various other topics that would leave them equipped=20
not so much to become ICT technicians or experts, but domain experts who=20
would know enough about ICT to allow them to apply it intelligently and=20
work with ICT technical experts in solving problems and designing solutions.I'm hoping that we might find a variety of different paths in this area:=20
one aimed at producing students with the type of skills we associate=20
with programme at CCH or the University of Alberta (to name two) on the=20
one hand, but that can also accommodate students with interest in other=20
aspects of informatics or who only want to brush up immediately=20
necessary skills.Apart from perhaps a remedial course on standalone software, I think=20
we'd be aiming primarily at covering networked technologies. And re=20
Word--I'm also wondering if we could responsibly take an ideologically=20
open source position without it becoming "tenured radicals" pushing=20
their hobby horses.Lou Burnard wrote:
