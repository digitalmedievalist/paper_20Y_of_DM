Valentina AsciuttiAbstract: Historical Linguistics studies the evolution of historical language=
s and earlier stages of living languages. By necessity, historical linguistic=
s has traditionally been based on the analytical study of exemplars from writ=
ten collections of texts. Given the technological constraints and the aims of=
 historical comparative philology of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the r=
eliance on qualitative assessment of a few exemplars was justified.
Towards the end of the last century, formalized collections of texts known as=
 corpora bloomed with the advent of computer technology. This made it feasibl=
e to automatically create very large corpora (> 100 million words), annotate =
them various linguistic information, and efficiently search and systematicall=
y retrieve information from them.
However, technological advances can only change a field if they find their pl=
ace in an appropriate methodological framework. The qualitative methods of co=
mparative philology (manually searching for exemplars) underutilize the infor=
mation available in today's historical corpora, and contemporary historical l=
inguistics is still largely based on the traditional methodology.  Few things=
 are more commonly taken for granted in historical linguistics than the assum=
ption that the researcher should eyeball every piece of data relevant to her =
analysis.
We disagree with this position, which we will henceforth refer to as the Smal=
l Data Fallacy. Instead, we believe that methods inspired by Big Data can and=
 should influence Historical Linguistics, and that such a move would entail a=
 qualitative leap forwards in Historical Linguistics research methods.
We will discuss some of the benefits, challenges, and limitations of applying=
 the Big Data framework to historical linguistics. We will also touch upon th=
e impact this would have on the fundamental aims of Historical Linguistics in=
 the21st century.Bios: Gard Jenset is a visiting scholar in the Faculty of Linguistics, Philol=
ogy and Phonetics, University of Oxford, with research interests in historica=
l corpus linguistics, corpora in ELT, statistics and quantitative research me=
thods in linguistics, corpus methods for semantics and cognitive linguistics.
Barbara McGillivray is a computational linguist, and works as a language engi=
neer in the Dictionary Department of Oxford University Press. She holds a PhD=
 in computational linguistics form the University of Pisa. Her research inter=
ests include: Language Technology for Cultural Heritage, Latin computational =
linguistics, quantitative historical linguistics, and computational lexicogra=
phy.NB This seminar will not be live-streamed.--===============7007730157487752710==
