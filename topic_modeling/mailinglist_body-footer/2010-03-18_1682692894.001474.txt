on is a prototype or proof-of-concept of my Old English textbook as an 
e-book. You can seen it here (still partial; the easiest/free way to

The iPad is bearing down on us; many e-readers are on the market; sales 
of e-books are doubling every year. I love good old paper books, but 
I've fascinated by the technology.Peter
