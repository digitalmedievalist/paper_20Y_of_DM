 and Ben who are now joining us. Very many thanks also to Malte Rehbein and T=
orsten Schassan who have both stepped down this year. Both Torsten and Malte =
have contributed a great deal to DM over a number of years, and so we will mi=
ss them and hope very much that they will continue to be actively involved.Thanks also to the other candidates for running =E2=80=93 we hope very much t=
hat you will stay involved =E2=80=93 and thanks finally to Orietta and Takako=
 for all their work managing the elections.I was personally very happy to see such a strong set of candidates this year,=
 and indeed the last few years. The number of members is growing rapidly as w=
ell, and so I look forward very much to what the future will bring to DM.Best wishes,Peter StokesDirector, Digital Medievalist
