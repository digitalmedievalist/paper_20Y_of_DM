at the French national library (BnF): few people have noticed, but now
images from the Gallica portal are royalty-free for any non-commercial use.
I don' think the news is very widespread, but just go on Gallica, look for
instance for a digitized manuscript (example "Latin 12584"), choose any
folio and click on "télécharger / imprimer" (download / print), and you'll
find a link to the non-commercial and commercial use policies.
