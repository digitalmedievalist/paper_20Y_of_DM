Subject: [MARKUP] EpiDoc SoSOL training news
To: MARKUP(a)lsv.uky.edu
As many of you will already know (welcome to 12 new list-members!)
there was a very successful EpiDoc/SoSOL trainig session last week in
London. Twelve professional papyrologists were trained in the use of
the new SoSOL tool(*) for tags-free markup of documentary texts. In
the process, c.100 texts were painlessly added to the Duke Databank of
Documentary Papyri.I'd like to remind people that another EpiDoc+SoSOL training week is
planned as part of the DHO summer school (June 28-July 2), on which
see http://dho.ie/ss2010/ . If any of you might be interested in
attending this workshop (cost is €300 for students, €400 waged--we
hope to have a couple bursaries to help with the cost), or in sending
a student or colleague to be trained in epigraphic or papyrological
markup, please write to the local organizers and/or myself as soon as
possible to express your interest. Registration is still open, but we
need to have a good idea of numbers in the next couple weeks.
*Please circulate this invitation widely.*In the meantime, we're happy to receive feedback, questions and other
reactions relating to this training or SoSOL in general on this list.(*) on the Papyrological Editor: see http://papyri.info/editor/ or
http://sosol.sourceforge.net/ or
http://idp.atlantides.org/trac/idp/wiki/SoSOL . Full documentation to
follow soon.Best,Gabriel--
