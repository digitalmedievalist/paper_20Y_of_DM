attention the following workshop an Newcastle University, 9/10 April. As some of you will know, in Newcastle we are currently working on a 
digital edition of the extant manuscripts from the medieval library 
of the Cistercian nunnery of Medingen (near Hannover, Germany. For a 
first glance of the project see http://research.ncl.ac.uk/medingen/, 
though at the moment we can't make the material available online due 
to copyright issues).
Andres.>Sacred Voices< 
A Workshop of German(a)Newcastle
'Sacred Voices' are to be understood as an expression of faith and 
devotion, ranging from God's voice to the response of the 
congregation and the discourse of individual worship.
This workshop-style symposium aims to make audible those utterances 
of belief in two main areas in which the 'Sacred Voices' are featured in the medieval manuscripts: staged dialogues and musical notation. 
The workshop will encompass both close readings of individual texts 
and the presentation of leading approaches in recent research.
Organized in cooperation with the Early Modern Studies @ Newcastle 
Group and other colleagues from the Faculty of Humanities and Social 
Sciences, this workshop is the launch event for the Newcastle 'Sacred Voices'-project, led by Elizabeth Andersen and Henrike Lähnemann.Wednesday, 9 April 2008
