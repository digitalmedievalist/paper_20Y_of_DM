any form we make. I really thought Murray's comments on its strengths 
and weaknesses, and particularly areas for improvement were exactly the 
type of thing we want to get from referees.And just to make sure we're all clear: though we may continue with this 
idea of identifying *accepting* referees, these will only be the people 
who agree, and who have actually recommended final publication; all 
intermediate and negative comments will be anonymous unless the referee 
insists otherwise.
