*VOX MEDIA: O Som na Literatura | Sound in Literature | El Sonido en la
Literatura*
Editores: Osvaldo Manuel Silvestre (Universidade de Coimbra)
Felipe Cussen (Universidade de Santiago do Chile)MATLIT's volume 5 is intent on exploring what we call literature as V=
OX
MEDIA: voice as a means for literature and the disturbances suffered by the
medium from the combined effect of performance and the technologies for
mediation, representation and reproduction. And also other instances, like
the tensions between the body and technology, audibility v. inaudibility of
text, sound and meaning, physical presence and/or absence of the authors,
and so forth. The goal is not only that of generating a catalogue or a
compendium of the contemporary effects of VOX MEDIA on the notion of
literature, but that of generating an archaeology for VOX MEDIA and for all
related phenomena repressed by their historical invisibility.Submissions must be uploaded before *October 31, 2016*. Prior to
submission, authors have to register in the journal system:
