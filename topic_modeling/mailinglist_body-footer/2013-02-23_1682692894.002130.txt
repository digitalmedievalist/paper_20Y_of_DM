library, provide the library with copies of the digital files but have an
embargo of X number of years before the library can make those files
available freely (lucky library if it actually has the infrastructure to
publish them on their own). This is only different because it's on a
national level. I would blame the BnF for not arguing more strongly for the
immediate access to the digital copies as I would assume the other
countries in the project did.This might be a good time to point out a new initiative, Reveal Digital (
revealdigital. <http://revealdigital.org>com) which is operating under a
new model which is accepting subscriptions while the digitization work is
happening, just enough to cover costs (which are clearly presented) and the
subscription costs depend on how many other institutions subscribe and the
size of the institution. Costs are much less than "traditional" [ProQuest
etc.] publications. After five years the publication will go into open
access. The first collection is modern (alternative press publications from
the mid-late 20th c.) but the model is appearling (to me, and to others in
the library community who are already signing on) and could be applied to
any collection including medieval materials. It's also a direct reaction to
the appauling costs and practices of some (not all) existing digital
publishers.I do think it's important to acknowledge that not all libraries have the
wherewithal to support the digitization and publication of their own
collections, that publishers do have a role to play in making collections
available, and that not all publishers are the same.DotOn Thursday, February 21, 2013, Bob Peckham wrote:>   Any comments on this news from France?
