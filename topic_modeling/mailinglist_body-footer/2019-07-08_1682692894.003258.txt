bmitted the paper and it went through the usual protocol of blind peer-review=
, so clearly a number of scholars must have supported it.Also, it is only a 'theory' - so it is open to testing and revision as all th=
eories are. That is how science works. I'm not sure why anyone would wish to =
counter that process, as it would be doing science a disservice.
Kindest regards,Gerard.________________________________

Subject: Re: [dm-l] Method Paper Available. .I am sorry for intervening, too. This paper has not been properly peer
reviewed and has been removed from the publication list of the
University of Bristol because of severe considerations regarding it's
contents. Experts in the field have a lot of concerns regarding the
method used in the study.Best RegardsGert BrantnrtAm 08.07.19 um 15:40 schrieb Gerard Cheshire:
