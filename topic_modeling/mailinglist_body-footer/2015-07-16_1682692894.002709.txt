London, WC1E 7HUHugh Cayless (Duke University)Integrating Digital EpigraphiesThis presentation will also be streamed live at 
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIamtu1Z62wL5XRk2mE8HKwIntegrating Digital Epigraphies (IDEs) is being developed as a Linked 
Data platform for digital epigraphy. The first round of development 
leverages data from partner projects including the PHI's Searchable 
Greek Inscriptions project, the SEG, the Claros concordance of 
epigraphical publication data, and epigraphy articles in JSTOR to 
develop a set of web services. Identifiers from any of the projects may 
be used to retrieve related data from any of the others. The goal of 
IDEs is not to be a portal or aggregator superseding partner projects, 
but a data hub that allows all of them to leverage each otherâ€™s work.ALL WELCOMEThe seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk,
