Valeria Vitale (Institute of Classical Studies)Recogito 2 is the free online annotation tool developed by Pelagios 
Commons. Its simple and clear interface features a set of options to 
create annotations about places, people and events on documents in 
different formats. Users can upload files to their personal working 
space and choose the degree of collaboration and openness that suits 
them: from individual annotations only visible to the creator, through 
simultaneous collaborative annotations of the same document, to Linked 
Open Data available for all to search and download. Designed primarily 
but not exclusively for geographical information, Recogito 2 represents 
a powerful tool to analyse ancient documents and their relationships in 
a spatial perspective.Livecast: https://youtu.be/Ja1ZVf9EXQ4Full abstract: http://digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2017-03vv.htmlALL WELCOME--
