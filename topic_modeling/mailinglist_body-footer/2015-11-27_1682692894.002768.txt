Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitDear Colleagues,Can you please give any example of a (small) digital collection of 
manuscript or printed primary sources which, 1) operates as an 
independent web-portal AND also 2) their data are in some way 
included/aggregated into some large collection or digital library?I am particularly interested in what happens as data pass from a "small" 
into a "large" digital resource? What kind of data are most suitable and 
frequent object of such aggregation in our area of digital humanities: 
only meta-data, or also msDesc, digital images, transcriptions? How 
"visible" is the original small collection after the aggregation? Etc.I hope this is not an off-topic question. Thank you for any advice,Matija--
