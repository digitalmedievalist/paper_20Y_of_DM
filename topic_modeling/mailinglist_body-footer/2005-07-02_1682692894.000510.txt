suggestions about additional abbreviations they'd like to see added.
MUFI (Medieval Unicode Font Initiative) is also open to such suggestions
(I can convey requests to the group). My own feeling is that I can't
copy everything in Capelli into a font, but I've got to hear from users
what would be most useful to them. I've already put in the ones most
useful to me.Peter BakerRichard Higgins wrote:> In a similar vein, is there a record type font/character set available
