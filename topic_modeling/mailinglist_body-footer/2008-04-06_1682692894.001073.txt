Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHi there,I have recreated a much fuller, and hopefully more neutral-toned
Digital Medievalist article on wikipedia at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Medievalist and would appreciate
it if anyone reading this would go and improve it.  (Specifically by
providing more external references, correcting the style to be even
more neutral-toned and wikipedia-like, etc.)Just thought I'd mention it in case you had a spare moment.Best,-James
