board positions. It is exciting to see the completion of the transition
of DM from an investigator-driven project to a fully membership-run
organisation.It is also exciting to see the addition of new people to the board. And
yet sad to see an old hand moving on. Outgoing board member Murray
McGillivray of the U of C was one of the three founding members of the
list serve (bestpractice) that ultimately led to the formation of
Digital Medievalist and an original member of the grant. With one exception, everybody on the DM board joined the project after
its initial inception (though several were on the first grant and set up
most of the aspects of the current organisation). Other original members
who have since moved on include Elizabeth Solopova (another member of
the original best-practice mailing list), Peter Baker, and Martin Foys.Once again thanks to all who have helped bring DM to its current
strength!-dan
