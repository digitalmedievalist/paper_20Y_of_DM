France.Burgart holds a M.A. in Medieval Studies and a M.Sc. in computer
sciences. She prepares a PhD Thesis in Medieval studies: study and
edition of the /Sermones ad status/ collection by the 13th century friar
Gilbert of Tournai, OFM. Since 2000, she has worked as a computer
scientist particularly focusing on digital humanities. In her current
position at the /Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales/ (EHESS -
UMR 5648), Lyon, France, she coordinates the computing aspects of
several projects involving the electronic edition of medieval documents
in TEI format (from latin sermons to accounts corpora, not to mention
the /Glossa ordinaria/ of the Bible), as long as databases and, to a
certain extent, GIS. She has led or been involved in the development of
various tools (/ScolastiX/, a collaborative XML annotation platform ;
/BibliOpera/, a multi-user online bibliographical database manager ;
/COL/, a latin spellchecker for MS Word and OpenOffice ; a meta-search
engine for a libraries portal without Z3950 ; ...). She is currently
working at a companion guide for scholars wanting to produce an
electronic edition. She also occasionally acts as a consultant for other
academic institutions, on computing aspects of History and Archaeology
related projects. Her sensibility to scholarly edition has been
developed by her role as a member, since 2002, of the editorial
committee of the /Médiéviste et l'Ordinateur <http://lemo.irht.cnrs.fr>/
journal. ==========Cummings, James.Research Officer, Research Technologies Service, University of Oxford.Cummings is the Senior RTS Project Officer of the Oxford University
Computing Services. His PhD was in medieval studies, and he works on a
number of projects such as the Text Encoding Initiative, and ENRICH (and
EU-funded project standardising medieval manuscript metadata across
Europe). His work for Digital Medievalist (DM) has mainly been on the
technical side. He was responsible for redesigning the technical
infrastructure of DM's new website (using TEI XML inside Apache's Cocoon
with custom XSLT, and fed automatically by the DM subversion server). He
has also moved the wiki and improved the DM mail handling systems. James
is running again for the DM Board so that he can continue such work. ==========McGillivray, Murray.Professor (formerly Head) of English, University of Calgary.McGillivray has been a digital medievalist (practitioner, theorist,
enthusiast) for over twenty years and has been involved with DM since
the beginning. His primary scholarly interest is the use of computer
methods in the development and distribution of scholarly editions. His
current digital projects include an electronic edition of the Sir Gawain
and the Green Knight manuscript (BL Cotton Nero A.x.) and the Online
Corpus of Old English Poetry. ==========Porter, Dorothy Carr.Program Coordinator, Collaboratory for Research in Computing for
Humanities, University of Kentucky.Porter is Program Coordinator of the Collaboratory for Research in
Computing for Humanities (RCH; http://www.rch.uky.edu/) and lead in the

projects in medieval studies and classics including the Electronic
Boethius (http://beowulf.engl.uky.edu/~kiernan/eBoethius/inlad.htm) and
the Homer Multitext project

interests are the relationship between text and image in encoding and
digital publication, and interdisciplinary collaboration. ==========Rehbein, Malte.Marie Curie Research Fellow at National University of Ireland, Galway
and member of the Transfer of Expertise in Technologies of Editing
(TEXTE) programme.Rehbein is a graduate in history and mathematics from University of
Göttingen and gained his first experience in the Digital Humanities as
an associate in the Duderstadt digitization project at
Max-Planck-Insitute for History in Göttingen (1996-99). His main
research interest is on methodology for creating digital scholarly
