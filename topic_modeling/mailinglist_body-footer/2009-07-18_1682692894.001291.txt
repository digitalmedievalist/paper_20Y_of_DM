Subject: [dm-l] gentle introduction to XSL, CSS, and/or stylesheets
generally?Hi all,I'm putting together a list of background reading for a very compressed 
introduction workshop. Does anybody know of a good gentle introduction 
to XSL, CSS, and/or stylesheets generally I could refer students to? 
Obviously there are hundreds on the web, so what I'm looking for is a 
battle-tested recommendation.-dan--
