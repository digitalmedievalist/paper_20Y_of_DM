Roberto suggest: with the fired up enthusiasm of this community, should
we see if we can't put together a posse to give the TEI SIG a push? As Gabriel Bodard and others at Digital Classicist have pointed out,
communities of practice like TEI, DM, DC are all complementary--and
indeed share many members. At times they are like different chatrooms in
the same larger community.As people who work more or less exclusively with manuscripts, or better
said, whose primary textual sources at any rate are never mechanically
reproduced we have an obvious interest in this issue. Though as Roberto
points out, the community that needs an effective section in the TEI is
much larger... and includes people dealing with correspondence, modern
literary manuscripts, documentary editions, and the like. Medievalists
with an interest in transcription are perhaps better situated within
their own fields than others since the sources are contemporary to the
period and seen by most as being a relatively central concern in a way
that they might not be in other periods.Perhaps we should see here who might be interested in putting together a
real crew for this and moving things along. At DM we could offer a
variety of means of support, particularly a place to publish refereed
working and/or finished research papers (We've been working very hard
lately at getting our workflow straightened out, and I think we've
overcome some of the gremlins that have delayed our production). And of
course a place where projects can describe what they are up to--and
allow others to find them--in our wiki.-dOn Wed, 2006-15-03 at 14:47 +0000, Lou Burnard wrote:
