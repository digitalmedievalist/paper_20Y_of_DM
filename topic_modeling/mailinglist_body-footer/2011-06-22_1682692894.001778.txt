Engelbart, inventor of the computer mouse and other things, in a famous
essay called "Augmenting human intellect:"

you

> upon lots of changes in the little things you do. This computerized system =
is

>=20Pondering this paragraph has been for me the best protection against
characteristic errors of overestimating or underestimating what machines can
do. The overestimating enthusiast are always telling you about
transformative events that never quite happen. The underestimating skeptics
forget the cumulative impact of the changing calculus of time costs.
Different things become quite literally "worthwhile."On the other hand, as the time cost of new opportunities, new chances for
wasting time emerge.From:  Nancy Stork <nancypstork(a)gmail.com>

Subject:  Re: [dm-l] SDH 2011 Supporting Digital HumanitiesI remember hearing this same enthusiastic rhetoric about how new technology
would transform the humanities in 1979 when the latest in digital technology
was a microfiche concordance.  The actual optical technology to read the
carbonized papyri at Herculaneum or to optically reconstruct destroyed
sections of manuscripts are a few instances I can think of where machines
will do something that humans cannot.  Other than that, while it's great to
have manuscript facsimiles available on the web and to catalog and
communicate over the Internet, how does this change anything other than the
ease with which we can do our research?
   Like you, I have been waiting for years to hear about how digital
humanities is fundamentally different from the old humanities in a new
medium.  And this is not to denigrate new projects for new media, but to
keep some historical perspective on the long term value of what scholars
have been doing since ancient times.
