 Channel as part of the 13th Annual (Virtual) Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscr=
ipt Studies in the Digital Age, November 18-20, 2020In the early spring of 2020, as the world shut down, scholarship and teaching=
 were thrown into a virtual, online world. In the hands-on world of manuscrip=
ts studies, students, teachers, researchers, librarians, and curators lost ph=
ysical access to the very objects upon which their work centered. But we were=
 ready. Thanks to world-wide digitization efforts over the past twenty years,=
 scholars at all levels and around the world have, by all counts, virtual acc=
ess to more manuscripts and manuscript-related metadata than even a generatio=
n ago and are benefited by a broad array of digital tools, technologies, and =
resources that allow them to locate, gather, analyze, and interrogate digitiz=
ed manuscripts and related metadata.This is the topic that the 2020 Schoenberg Symposium will be focused on. Alon=
g with the Symposium, we are issuing invitations for Lightning Talk videos to=
 be posted as a series to the SIMS YouTube Channel (https://www.youtube.com/u=
ser/SchoenbergInstitute/)Videos must be five minutes long or shorter, and may present any project rela=
ting to manuscript studies in the digital age.Submit your proposal here: https://forms.gle/6zJqNUgFgwbCxsyq5Deadline for submitting applications is October 28
Applicants will be notified by November 4Lightning Talk videos must be five minutes or shorter. Longer videos will be =
shortened before being posted online.Videos must be submitted to SIMS by November 11The symposium is Free and is open to the public! For more about the symposium=
