H awareness raising activity. The awards are nominated and voted for entirely=
 by the public. These awards are intended to help put interesting DH resource=
s in the spotlight and engage DH users (and general public) in the work of th=
e community. Although the working language of DH Awards is English, nominatio=
ns may be for any resource in any language. Awards are not specific to geogra=
phy, language, conference, organization or field of humanities. There is no f=
inancial prize associated with these community awards. There were many nomina=
tions and the international nominations committee (http://dhawards.org/dhawar=
ds2020/committee/) reviewed each nomination. We're sorry if your nomi=
nation was not included, or changed category, all decisions are final once vo=
ting opens.  Please see http://dhawards.org/dhawards2020/faqs <http://dhaward=
s.org/dhawards2020/faqs> for this and other frequently asked questions.Anyone is allowed to vote, yes anyone! But please only vote once!Please cast your vote by looking at the nominations and following the link to=
 voting form at http://dhawards.org/dhawards2020/voting/ before midnight (GMT=
) on 2021-03-07 when the voting will be closed.Good luck!--===============5522010345868552927==
