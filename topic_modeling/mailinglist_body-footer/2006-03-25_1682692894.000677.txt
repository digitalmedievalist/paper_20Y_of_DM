--------------------------------------------------------------------------Hello Dan,A couple of hours back I was quaffing a double-shot latte in a supermarket
cafe near the Scottish border when, as invariably happens in such
circumstances, a former student of mine emerged from nowhere and said "there
was a posting on DM-L a while back about dynamic XSLT sheet switching you
could have answered".So I took a peek when I got home (I don't subscribe to DM-L) and behold,
'twas even so.I think my first response would have been to say do the transform server
side.  It's certainly not necessary to get embroiled with Cocoon to do that.
Half a dozen lines in any common scripting language that has an XSLT library
will get you a CGI script that will accept as params from your browser an
xml file name and a stylesheet name, then apply the xslt to the xml and send
the html back to the browser.However, it looks like you want a client side solution, so I've hacked a
quick one together for you as a demo.If you go *using IE6 on Windows* to
http://www.anglo-norman.net/sitedocs/workshop/switch-demo.html
you will get a page that lets you apply any of a choice of three xslt sheets
to it client-side. If you like, you can also download
www.anglo-norman-net/sitedocs/workshop/switch-demo.zip
that contains all the
necessary files: an xml document; three xslt sheets; and the loader
switch-demo.html file itself, which contains the actual code that does the
business. But the only essential thing is the html; beyond that you can plug
in any xml and xslt you like and the thing will work on that data instead. I
have tried to explain the workings of the dynamic html in the html file
itself. I haven't similarly commented the XSLT, because that's not really
the point of concern here.The sample I provide is for IE6 on Win32 only. Before that brings down the
wrath of the self-righteous upon me, let me say that it can just as readily
be done in Mozilla/Firefox on any platform using its internal Transformix
engine instead of the MS DLL I use here, although the necessary code is a
bit more complicated and you have to be more careful about the mime-type
configuration of any server from which you deliver. But if any knee-jerk
anti-Windowers care to put their brains where their zeal is, they will I'm
sure soon be able to put together a Redmond-free version.Please feel free to repost this on my behalf if you think it would be of any
broader interest.Bon weekend!Michael--
