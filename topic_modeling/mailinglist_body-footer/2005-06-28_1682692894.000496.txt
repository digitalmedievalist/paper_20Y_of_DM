Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitBy way more (I hope) of a plea for help than of self-promotion:I've posted a beta of Junicode 0.6.5 on my websitewww.engl.virginia.edu/OE/junicode/junicode.htmland I'm hoping that some members of this list will want to download and
test it.I had hoped to completely implement the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative
recommendation, but decided I should release it half-done. The latest
version of OS X seems much pickier about fonts than earlier versions and
some bugs in the current version were causing it to be rejected. Since I
still can't test on OS X myself, I'm particularly hoping for help from
Mac users.Though MUFI is not complete in this version, it nevertheless includes
some substantial revisions. The number of characters in the "Regular"
style has gone from something over 1400 to 1756, in large part because
the whole of "Latin Extended Additional" (U+1E00 - U+1EF9) has now been
implemented. In addition, "hinting" of the Regular and Bold styles has
progressed far enough that nearly all documents produced by medievalists
will look good on a computer screen.To download, scroll to the bottom and click on the link for the test
version of 0.6.5. Sorry, no documentation yet; but members of this list
will know what to do.Thanks,
Peter--===============7236958804429709235==--
