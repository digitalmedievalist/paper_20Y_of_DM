TIFFS with a paper-fed Ricoh 2238 on a network. If you have lots of pages,
this is the best way. Find a benefactor with a good business scanner and go
nuts.A standard desktop scanner....20-30 pages per hour.Photoshop is not necessary unless you are doing complex restoration. If it
is just for cropping, go to Macromedia.com and download the 30 day trial of
Fireworks. There is no difference for basic editing functions and quality.travis-----Original Message-----

Subject: Re: [dm-l] Equipment for creating digital facsimilesFor texts (books) then I would say use a scanner.  I know someone who did
this with a anthology of Old English by Conybeare.  The facs. was very
good.  If you use a scanner you can produce pages as fast as the scanner
can scan them.  Its up to you really!  Also, I would suggest using
Photoshop for your imaging program, because that's the best available.Abdullah AlgerQuoting Dieter Köhler <d.k(a)philo.de>:> I have been involved in a planning committee to prepare suggestions for t
