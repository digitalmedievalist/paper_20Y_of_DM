o semestral issues of the Journal (June and December) to the concept of =E2=
=80=98relations' and how these relations are implemented, operational=
ised and analysed as interdependencies, links, and connections in practices o=
f Digital and Public Humanities scholarship. Be it through the construction o=
f simple relational databases or by means of complex correlations of data, ma=
terials, immaterial aspects, and publics, the interdisciplinary field of Digi=
tal and Public Humanities truly strives on building relationships. Far from s=
hutting themselves up in a lonesome ivory tower, scholars in this domain are =
prone to bridging experiences between different disciplines, interconnecting =
with diverse audiences for research and dissemination purposes, and linking c=
omputational models to cultural manifestations. Relations maintain a very hum=
anistic character, as they form the immaterial structure onto which human soc=
ieties are based. Indeed, transferred into a technological setting, the princ=
iple of relationship-building can be found as the core feature of interconnec=
ted data, authority files, user-centred design, usability, user-experience, a=
udience interaction, and many more aspects that became an integral part of Di=
gital and Public Humanities.The very act of building relations or putting things into relationship =E2=80=
=93 be they technology and culture, scholars and audiences, data and material=
s =E2=80=93 thus form the backbone of scholarly projects that came to define =
this research field. In Digital Textual Scholarship scholars can see the text=
 as a hub, whose relations point in many directions. They can explore, formal=
ise, visualise, and process its connections with paratexts, other texts, phys=
ical documents, places, people, concepts as well as with readers. In Digital =
and Public History it is possible to establish connections between sources, e=
vents, place, dates, or people, through a database, a network analysis map, o=
r more generally the semantic web. In Public History also the relationship be=
tween the research and its public is crucial: the active or passive participa=
tion of the audience can affect questions, methodology and research outcomes =
in many different ways. Relations between archaeological contexts and spaces =
are key factors to decipher and investigate stratigraphic sequences and past =
landscapes in virtual reconstructions (i.e. extended matrix approach, archeoB=
IM, etc.) and GIS studies (i.e. viewshed analysis, least-cost path analysis, =
etc.). At the same time, the integration of different remote sensing techniqu=
es and expertises often provide significant results. In Digital and Public Ar=
t History subjects may address the connection between GLAM studies and the cr=
eative industries sector as well as the artistic productions, considering: th=
e relation between public space and art historical environment, including dif=
ferent techniques of virtual reconstruction (3D modelling, gaming, VR360), th=
e implementation of digital collections adopting the IIIF framework (iconogra=
phy, diagnosis, descriptions), and multimedia solutions for data collection a=
nd accessibility. The implication of digital technologies in the preservation=
, management and interpretation of historical, cultural, and archaeological c=
ontexts is a way to make knowledge more accessible for different audiences. T=
he engagement of society in participatory ways highlights the importance of c=
reating dialogue, cohesion, identity, and sustainable development.Hence, for its 2023 volume magaz=C3=A9n is set to examine in two semestral is=
sues the concept of =E2=80=9CRelations=E2=80=9D as an intrinsic characteristi=
c of Digital and Public Humanities. Scholars are particularly invited to subm=
it contributions that span from theoretical debates to methodological reflect=
ions, also comprising the examination of particular case studies from the het=
erogeneous domains of Digital and Public History, Art History, Archaeology, C=
ultural Heritage and Textual Scholarship. Eventually, magaz=C3=A9n's =
volume 2023 will draw particular attention to the public aspects of such ende=
avours, given that successful research projects hold firm to the principle of=
 audience involvement from their very inception, rather than having public in=
teraction just as a late side-effect of scholarly work.For scholars interested in submitting a proposal, please send the provisional=
 title, the abstract between 250-500 words together with a short biographical=
 note and a possibly also provisional bibliography. The abstract should addre=
ss the following questions: What kind of materials and humanistic research qu=
estions are concerned? What digital/public methods are employed and how do th=
ey tackle the research aims? If the prospective paper addresses a case study =
or a particular project, authors should please state whether it has been comp=
leted and already made available to the research community.All materials should be sent by September 30, 2022, via the submission portal=
 on the editorial platform of our academic publisher Edizioni Ca' Fos=
cari. Notice of selection will be given to authors within four weeks from the=
 submission deadline.Finalised contributions are expected to be 6,000-9,000 words long (notes and =
bibliography included) and will undergo double blind peer review. Accepted la=
nguages are Italian and English, though all texts must have an English abstra=
ct and stick to the =E2=80=98Editorial Guidelines' of Edizioni Ca=E2=
=80=99 Foscari. Texts that should not comply with editorial guidelines or tha=
t the editors should deem linguistically inappropriate won't be accep=
ted. Please note that the journal does not offer language proof-reading servi=
ces to the authors, who must also secure all copyright permissions (reproduct=
ion costs included) for images and other media.The deadline for all accepted articles is February 15, 2023, for issue 1 and =
July 15, 2023, for issue 2. Final publication of the first issue is planned b=
y June 2023, while the second issue will be due in December 2023. For further=
 details please contact the editorial board (magazen(a)unive.it<mailto:magaze=
