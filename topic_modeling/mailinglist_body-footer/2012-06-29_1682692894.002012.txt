====Dear DM-L subscribers,The Digital Medievalist Executive Board elections are now open.  To
vote, please fill in the brief survey at:http://surveymonkey.com/s/DM-elections2012You do _not_ have to be a medievalist to vote, nor highly technical.
If you are on the DM-L mailing list (where this message has been
posted), then that is the only qualification needed to vote.  The only
information we ask is to confirm the email address you are subscribed
with and choose (up to four) candidates to vote for. There is an
optional question for feedback about DM at the end.  The
biographies of the candidates are available on the survey page. Any
personal information will be deleted afterwards.We have a good slate of seven candidates with a wide range of
experience to choose from. The DM Executive Board is responsible for
the running of DM and the day-to-day management of its outputs such as
the journal, wiki, this mailing list, and conference sessions. One of
the first tasks of the new DM Board will be to choose a new director
(potentially from among one of the newly elected members).The survey will close at midnight GMT at the end of:  Friday 29 June 2012.James Cummings
