can have from the knowledge of a language. And as you want to point to 
the lexicon or dictionary it appears to me as a citation which usually 
is covered by copyright laws as scientific use of a work. And as you are 
compiling an index of different works you are not really reprinting them 
but creating another work which should be allowed anyway. If at last you 
add lemmata on your own you pass the limits of just reusing what has 
been there already. ;-)Anyway: These are only opinions and by no means a legal advice.> Or do I really need to talk to a lawyer?That can't be wrong to have one at hand these days. :-(Best, Torsten--
