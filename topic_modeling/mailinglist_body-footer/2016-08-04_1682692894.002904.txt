1) International Conference, 12=C2=9614 September 2016Illuminated Charters =C2=96 from the Margins of Two Disciplines to the Core of
Digital HumanitiesConference venue: Vienna, Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv, Minoritenplatz=20
1, DachfoyerArchivists, art historians, medievalists, digital humanists, friends of
pattern recognition, media studies, and of objects hidden for centuries:=20
all these (and many more) are the target audience of our meeting.We proudly present speakers from Tampa (Florida), England, France and=20
Italy as well as Estonia and Georgia. We are honoured that Olivier=20
Guyotjeannin (Paris), Elizabeth Danbury (London), Alison Stones=20
(Pittsburgh: Public Lecture, 12 September, 7pm), Irmgard Fees (Munich)=20
and Francesca Manzari (Rome) have accepted our invitation to present=20
papers (programme and abstracts:=20

<http://illuminierte-urkunden.uni-graz.at/de/tagung-12-1492016/> ).Much more important, though, is the quality and variety of topics:
discussions about data-modelling, best-practice examples of combined
presentations of image and metadata are highlights of the digital part.
Surveys of regional characteristics (England, Lombardy, Venice, Rome,=20
Latvia and Lithuania, Georgia) and in depth-studies of single objects=20
are =C2=96 very intentionally =C2=96 combined as necessary methodological=20
contrast. Studies focusing on archival holdings in specific regions lead=20
to papers dealing with chanceries and special types of charters, which=20
are regularly decorated with artistic means. These means range from=20
graphic signs developing in private charters in St Gall during the 8th=20
century to signs characteristic of specific types of charters and highly=20
refined artefacts made for famous late medieval collectors, and finally=20
to (printed) charters which are equally perfect advertising media.The organizing team (Gabi Bartz, Martina Bürgermeister, Markus Gneiss,
Martin Roland, Georg Vogeler, Andreas Zajic) is pleased to invite you to
this conference. Due to the limited space available at the =C2=84Dachfoyer=C2=
=93 of
the =C2=84Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv=C2=93, we kindly ask you to register i=

Vogeler and Andreas Zajic have decided =C2=96 after a peer-reviewing-process =and internal discussions =C2=96 to publish first results of the FWF project
=C2=93Illuminated Charters as =C2=B4Gesamtkunstwerk=C2=B4=C2=94.      <http://monasterium.net/mom/IlluminierteUrkunden/collection>
http://monasterium.net/mom/IlluminierteUrkunden/collection678 illuminated collective indulgences are freely accessible for everyone.
We are well aware that we can only present =C2=93work in progress=C2=94. This=
 is=20
true for the digital part as well as for the content. Part of the=20
indexing work has still to be implemented into the search environment=20
and depth of information varies significantly.
Partly this is a deliberate decision, because it does not make sense to=20
offer =C2=93extensive abstracts=C2=94 for poorly decorated objects which are =
only=20
of importance due to their character as forerunners to later, more=20
extensively illuminated indulgences. On the other hand there are=20
charters which deserve more in-depth treatment, but parts of
the description ([extensive] abstract, diplomatic comment, description=20
of decoration and art-historical commentary) are still lacking.
We hope, however, that users are willing to accept such shortcomings in
order to get access more quickly. We want to encourage each and every=20
user to give us feedback ( <mailto:illuminierteurkunden(a)gmail.com>
illuminierteurkunden(a)gmail.com) such as additions, corrections=20
(including typos), hints to additional sources, images or reference=20
literature; do not hesitate to point out amendments no matter how small.
