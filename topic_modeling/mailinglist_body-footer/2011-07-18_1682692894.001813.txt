ce for the study of English liturgy created by the late David Chadd.  Does an=
yone know what happened to the site (http://www.cursus.uea.ac.uk/)?  It appea=
rs to have disappeared, and the email address provided is also a dead-end.With many thanksEyal PolegThe Royal Irish Academy is subject to the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 & =
