ulties with the Thomas L. Gravell Watermarks Archive database. As is summariz=
ed below, we have moved everything, confirmed that we can update a MySQL data=
base on the new server using FMP and the ODBC driver, but the Gravell databas=
e itself is not communicating, despite updating scripts, etc. Has anyone on t=
he list had recent experience with these issues? One problem is that it has b=
een awhile since we have had to deal with a migration and there are some rust=
y chops! Thanks in advance for any insights. Here's the summary from my tech =
person:- Moved the MySQL database to the new server. Verified that the database user=
 has all privileges to manage the database.- Verified that Port 3306 is open so the database can be managed remotely.=20- Installed the Actual Technologies ODBC Driver, created a new DSN for the My=
SQL database, and verified that we can connect to the MySQL database using OD=
BC.- Updated the FileMaker Pro scripts to use the new DSN we created.I can confirm that the MySQL database can be modified in FileMaker Pro via OD=
BC (I created a new FileMaker Pro database to test this), but something in th=
e scripts in the existing FileMaker Pro database is preventing the ODBC conne=
ction from working.
