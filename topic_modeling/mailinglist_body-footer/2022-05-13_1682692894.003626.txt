<Call for Nominations to DM Board 2022=E2=80=932026>Digital Medievalist (DM) is an international web-based community for
medievalists working with digital media to support scholars in meeting
the increasingly sophisticated demands faced by designers of
contemporary digital projects. Digital Medievalist publishes an open
access journal, sponsors conference sessions, runs an email discussion
list and encourages best practice in digital medieval resource creation.
Digital Medievalist is overseen by an nine-member Executive Board of
medievalists with considerable experience in the use of digital media in
the study of medieval topics.Digital Medievalist is now seeking nominations (including
self-nominations) to fill 5 positions on its Executive Board for terms
beginning August 2022. Elections will be holding at the end of June
2022.
Board positions are for 4-year terms, and incumbents may be re-elected
(for a maximum of 2 terms [8 years] in a row). Members of the Board are
responsible for the overall direction of the organisation and leading
the Digital Medievalist's many projects and programmes.
This is a working board, and so it is expected that those elected will
be willing and able to commit a little bit of time to helping Digital
Medievalist undertake some of its activities (such as helping to run its
journal, developing programming to support DM's mission including onl=
ine
events or conference sessions, and contributing to its social media
presence and activity, among others).=E2=86=92  WE ESPECIALLY ENCOURAGE NOMINATIONS OF DIGITAL MEDIEVALISTS LIVING
AND/OR WORKING OUTSIDE THE US AND EUROPE =E2=86=90For further information about the Executive Board and Digital
