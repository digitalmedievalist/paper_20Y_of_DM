Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI absolutely hate workarounds like using images or substituting "3" for 
yogh. Like James, I like UTF-8 for web pages. It makes for smaller 
files/faster downloads than entities, and IE (always the problem child) 
seems to handle UTF-8 better than it does entities for some reason. But 
for the "base" (presumably XML) file the considerations are different. 
Don't want to get into a long discussion, but perhaps the most important 
is not to require particular fonts or applications. It's hard to say 
what's best for the long haul, but Murray's solution seems very good to 
me. I'll just add that the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative 
(http://helmer.aksis.uib.no/mufi/) suggests entity names for all the 
Unicode characters it recognizes as useful for medievalists, and also 
for all the code points is claims in the Private Use Area.And Murray--if you have questions about whether particular characters 
are present in the Unicode standard I may be able to help.PeterMurray McGillivray wrote:>
