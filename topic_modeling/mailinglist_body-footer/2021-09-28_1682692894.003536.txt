 Channel as part of the 14th Annual (Virtual) Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscr=
ipt Studies in the Digital Age, November 17-19, 2021Engaging with pre-modern books and manuscripts necessarily involves reckoning=
 with the paradox of loss. While a historical document from the distant past =
is the material survivor of a singular attempt to hedge against the disappear=
ance of an idea, image, or text, the extant specimen always has to be conside=
red alongside missing exemplars, damage and erasure, lost comparanda, and the=
 vanished life-worlds that produced the object in the first place. This sympo=
sium will interrogate the notions of loss, survival, and recuperation in manu=
script studies, so often in the background but rarely acknowledged as definin=
g features of the field.For our 2021 Lightning Talk videos, we are particularly interested in talks t=
hat focus on digital aspects of loss in manuscript studies. The videos will b=
e posted to the SIMS YouTube channel. You can see the 2020 Lightning Talks he=
