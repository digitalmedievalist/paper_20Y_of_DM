November 2007, University of Maryland), I would like to put together a
proposal for a session on Markup as a theory of text. This topic came up
on TEI several months ago and received some expressions of interest.
Basically, I am wondering about two types of questions:1) What are the theoretical implications of digital markup for editors,
paleographers, book historians, literary critics, linguists, etc. Are
they different from, similar to, or of a completely different order from
previous print practice?2) Are markup schemas theories of the structure of a text in the way
that linguistic theories are theories of language or literary theories
are theories about literature? Do they/should they have theoretical
lives of their own?Of course I'm open to other understandings of the topic and papers do
not need to concentrate specifically, exclusively, or at all on the TEI.
They can be broad ranging or concentrate on specific smaller issues.To keep with the TEI submission guidelines, I'd like to have abstracts
emailed to me daniel.odonnell(a)uleth.ca (*not* the address I am using to
post to this mailing list) by March 26th, so that I have sufficient time
to come up with a slate before the TEI's April 6 deadline.-dan
