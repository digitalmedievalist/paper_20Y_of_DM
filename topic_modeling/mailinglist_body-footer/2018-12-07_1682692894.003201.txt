Editions, Graph Data-Models and Semantic Web Technologies is now been
extended until the 16th of December.
There is a lot going on in the DH community this week, including an
international conference and workshops, and an additional week might be
useful for those interested.
We take this opportunity to remind that the Workshop is open and free of
charge. Attendance without a paper is also possible and we are looking
forward to a fruitful discussion.Best wishes,
the Organization Committee
*Workshop on Scholarly Digital Editions, Graph Data-Models and Semantic Web
Technologies*
Universit=C3=A9 de Lausanne, 3-4 June 2019
<http://wp.unil.ch/graphsde/>
*Call for Papers*
Digital texts processed by machines are linear strings of characters, but
in most research activities in the Humanities (philology, linguistics,
corpus-based analysis, cultural heritage, etc.) we store them in
*databases* and
we add *markup* to the text, that is a kind of intelligence made computable
thanks to the use of widespread data-models, formats and standards.
In the last decades, the popularity of *graph* data-models has increased,
in accordance with the *semantic web* proposition and the development of
standards such as RDF and OWL. Graph databases, in the form of triple
stores (such as Graph-DB) or of labeled-property-graphs (Neo4j), are
regarded as powerful and flexible solutions by research and cultural
institutions, and private companies alike.
The workshop is held to explore possible interactions between *digital
texts*, the *graph* data-model, *scholarly editions* and the *semantic web*.
The combinations of these objects/concepts, pursued in the last decades,
remains experimental to date, and it represents one of the possible
development for the field of *digital scholarly editing*.
Contributions on one or more of the following topics are particularly
welcome:   - the conceptualization of *text as graph*;
   - the use of *graph-databases* for digital editions;
   - the* semantic web resources* for building digital scholarly editions;
   - the *interoperability* among digital texts through Linked Data
   Vocabularies;
   - the *integration* of graph flavoured data into xml documents.We welcome contributions from those involved in the development of *tailor-ma=
de
solutions* for small scale projects as well as of large-scale
*infrastructure*, focused on the *theory* and/or on the *practice* of this
happy or unhappy combination.
The workshop includes *presentations* and a *working group* session.
Please note that the word 'workshop' means here a place for sharing ongoing
research and not a hands-on training.
*Invited speakers*   - Ronald Haentjens Dekker (Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences =E2=80=93 Human=
