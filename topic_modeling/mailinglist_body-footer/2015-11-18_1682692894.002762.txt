====WORKSHOP AUTOMATED HANDWRITTEN TEXT RECOGNITION TRANSKRIBUS AND THE
‘RESOLUTIONS OF THE DUTCH STATES-GENERAL’ (Den Haag, Netherlands, 25
November 2015)The workshop introduces Transkribus and is organized by Huygens ING, INL
and the tranScriptorium project. Transkribus is developed in the EU funded
project tranScriptorium, a research infrastructure for transcribing and
automated text recognition of historical documents.Automated recognition of handwritten documents (HTR) is no longer wishful
thinking but a real option. Whether it concerns medieval codices or modern
archival documents, HTR is not only able to create an automated
transcription, it also offers significantly improved search capabilities
through new search methods (“keyword spotting”).Until recently, intensive efforts by specialized researchers have been the
only way to make the content of the resolutions accessible. In the new
project, alternative ways to make the content of the resolutions accessible
for researchers and other users are explored. Huygens-ING carries out a
number of pilot projects to clarify to which extent advanced ICT techniques
and tools can reduce the dependency on manual labor. Working with HTR is
one of these pilots.The workshop  shows preliminary results of a training set of the 17th
century resolutions of the Dutch Staten-Generaal (Estates General), of
automated structuring of printed 18th century resolutions. Moreover, it
also offers a hands-on Transkribus session for the participants.The transcripts of the *Resolutions of the States-General *consist of
200.000 pages of handwritten text that not only reflect the invention and
early development of the new Dutch State, but also are a witness of the
daily political activities of the “Hoogmogende Heren”.*Programme*Automated Handwritten Text Recognition – Transkribus and the project
