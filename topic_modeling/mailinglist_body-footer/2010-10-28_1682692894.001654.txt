Some institutions have a copy stand available for use, but I bring a
lightweight tripod if they don't. One archive even had a pair of
balanced lights, but most places where I have worked (in France and
Belgium) won't let you add any light, so you are at the mercy of
whatever you can get from a nearby window (if even that).The job is most easily accomplished if you have a digital camera that
you can operate remotely from your laptop (tethered operation).
Someone here has reported that the Canon G11 has dropped that
ability--that's really too bad. Canon used to provide that support for
most of their cameras, and that would otherwise be a great camera for
the job. Besides camera, tripod and laptop, I carry a pocket spirit
level (to square the photographic plane with the tabletop), a grey
scale, and a ruler for inclusion in each shot. I also have a sheet of
white paper to place behind the folio being shot, so that if there are
any holes in the folio, you don't see what's on the page beneath. Best
color reproduction results come if you set a custom white balance. I
always shoot in RAW and set the exposure for deep depth of field. We
tend to think of the manuscript page as being a flat object, but my
experience has been that most folios occupy the third dimension, often
in ways that can be very difficult to reproduce. Therefore, I also
take careful notes for each folio of things that might not render well
in photographs--text lost in shreds, holes, creases, gutters, etc.In 1993, I idealistically tried to invent the online manuscript image
archive--originally as an ftp server, but as soon as there were web
clients for PC and Mac, it migrated to the web
(dscriptorium--currently off-line for server updating). I secured
permission to distribute images from a number of libraries, but some
of them refused to allow it. A large number of other on-line
collections have appeared in the meantime--many of which (but not all)
are operated by the institutions which own the manuscripts. Here's a
list of some: http://manuscriptevidence.org/data/node/27. Even
important libraries have extreme diversity in the quality of images
that they put up.JesseOn Tue, Oct 26, 2010 at 7:05 AM, Dot Porter <dot.porter(a)gmail.com> wrote:
