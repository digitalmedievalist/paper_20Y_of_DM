field over the last couple of years and it would be kind of disturbing
to discover I thought it was all a waste of time. But the challenge
"markup languages are obsolete"--or perhaps better phrased, "are a waste
of effort for someone who is not intrinsically interested in them" seems
such a head on challenge, I thought I'd see what happens if you really
ask the question.My experience has been that people who find structural markup useful
find it very useful and the arguments for learning and using it almost
beyond obvious... and those on the outside don't understand at all why
anybody would bother. So I thought, alright what non-trivial reasons as
there for learning what is in essence a third discipline for most
editors (i.e. disciplinary skills, editing, and markup).-d
