announcement of the 'virtual summer camp' organized by the VeDPH (Venice

Venice) in substitution of the summer school that was cancelled due to
the COVID-19 pandemia.
Teaching materials will be published in
https://vedph.github.io/summercampBest regards,
Paolo MonellaVisiting Scholar
Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities
Ca' Foscari University of Venice---It was with great disappointment that we had to cancel the first Venice
Summer School in Digital and Public Humanities due to the coronavirus
emergency. All the more, we are now happy to announce the first Venice
Virtual Summer Camp on Digital and Public Humanities to take place from
6 - 10 July 2020. It is a condensed version of the original training
programme, transformed and adapted to the online modality and the
circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a positive side effect, a
large number of seminars and presentations can now be offered without
registration and free of charge as open events. Other training sessions
are restricted to a number of participants and places have been reserved
for the successful applicants of the originally planned Summer School in
Venice.The virtual summer camp is organised by the Venice Centre for Digital
and Public Humanities [https://www.unive.it/vedph] and includes four
different thematic strands: (1) Digital Textual Scholarship, (2) Digital
and Public History, (3) Digital and Public Art History, and (4) Digital
Archaeology and its Public.
Classes will be delivered by the colleagues from the centre and other
expert scholars from internationally renowned institutions. We are most
grateful to everyone being actively involved in the realisation of an
outstanding programme, and especially to our keynote speakers Elena
Pierazzo (University of Tours) and Fabio Vitali (University of Bologna).For more information, see the Virtual Summer Camp Website
[https://vedph.github.io/summercamp].***Strand #1: Digital Textual ScholarshipThis strand provides a brief overview of theories and practices in
digital scholarly editing. Participants will be introduced to the very
basics of markup and text encoding, linked open data and semantic web
technologies, documentation and analysis of material textual aspects,
and tools and applications for publication. The format will alternate
open seminars with laboratory sessions and hands-on exercises restricted
to successful applicants of the originally planned summer school. The
famous travel report of the Venetian explorer Marco Polo will serve as a
starting point (as preserved in an illustrated manuscript copy from the
Bodleian Library). Further resources and all teaching materials will be
freely accessible on our Github repository

public approach to historical research and dissemination. The classes
aim at giving an overview of very different topics, ranging from memory
to social media, from television to digital tools, offering reflections
on how we connect to, reconstruct, understand and eventually tell our
past with digital and public methodologies. The strand includes
activities that the students can perform on their own before getting
feedback from the teacher. A special attention will be devoted to the
intersection between history and the exceptional situation we're going
through due to the Covid-19 emergency.

This strand focuses on the technological development and its cultural
implications which occurred in the arts sector over the last decades. In
doing this, the digital aspect is approached both on the side of
artistic production and the art system as well as on the side of museums
and art historical representation. The issues of technological change,
digital nativity, virtual realms and digital tools will be discussed
also in the context of the current international situation of crisis.
Both the theoretical debate and practical tools for digital art
historians shall be explored by means of lectures and labs, which will
include a hands-on workshop on tools for digital analysis of
illustrations, a students' forum on digital culture at the time of
Covid-19, and a roundtable to discuss recent tools and developments in
Digital and Public Art History with experts of European renown.Monday, 6 July 2020

This strand focuses on theories and practices that archaeologists apply
in surveys, remote sensing, spatial analysis, data collection and data
management. Participants will engage in digital strategies to analyze
the heritage and visualize, share and communicate it to the public.
Moreover, taking advantage of the recent Covid-19 lockdown experience,
and using archaeological tools and methods, Strand #4 aims to explore
how the materiality of representative objects that shaped/are shaping
our daily life may be narrated, interpreted, visualized and digitized.Monday, 6 July 2020
