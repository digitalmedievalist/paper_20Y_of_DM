Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitOf interest to DM, a report from the ACH (Association for Computers and the
Humanities: http://www.ach.org/) general meeting at DH2011 (Digital
Humanities 2011 conference: https://dh2011.stanford.edu/)  Especially of
interest may be the last item in the report, a discussion of ACH partnering
with other groups to support local/regional events. Not mentioned in the
report, there was also a discussion about ACH partnering with scholarly
organizations and communities. As someone with connections both to DM
(former board member) and to the ACH (current executive secretary) I'd be
interested to hear ideas from the DM community on how the ACH might be able
to support our community.Dot---------- Forwarded message ----------

       Subject: Report from ACH Annual General Meeting at StanfordDear Colleagues,This is intended as a brief report on the ACH Annual General Meeting
that took place during the Digital Humanities 2011 conference at
Stanford. The first notable aspect of the meeting was the astounding
attendance: there were over 80 people present. In the past years the
meeting has shifted from reporting the deliberations of the Executive
Council (not always the most compelling content) to a summary of key
points and a more open format of discussion and community-focused
initiatives.We began the meeting by recognizing the passing away of our friend and
colleague Chuck Bush, who was the ACH Treasurer and served on its
executive council for more than 20 years (see
http://ach.org/charles-douglas-bush-1948-2011).New members of the Executive Council were welcomed and outgoing
members were thanked. A warm and sustained ovation was reserved for
Julia Flanders, outgoing President extraordinaire.Next we launched into the annual ACH Jobs Slam, a chance for
prospective employees to introduce themselves (Ed Finn and Molly Des
Jardin) as well as an encouraging range of job opportunities:* Mellon Postdocs at Emory: http://bit.ly/disc-postdoc
* Research Professorship at BYU: http://bit.ly/jWu6EI
* Lecturer in Digital Information Studies at UCL: http://bit.ly/hFCaRH
* Assoc. Library Director of Digital Initiatives at McGill:
http://bit.ly/kcD1gz
* Digital Humanities Academic Administrator at UCLA: http://bit.ly/iCQI4g
* Web Developers at NYPL: http://bit.ly/mRGKA0We also pointed to two very useful lists of jobs:
http://www.arts-humanities.net/jobs and http://www.hastac.org/forum/23
Finally, we reminded everyone of the ongoing ACH mentoring programme
http://ach.org/mentoring We encourage thesis supervisors who have
students finishing and looking for DH-oriented jobs to contact the
Mentoring committee.Following the Jobs Slam we covered some new and ongoing initiatives.
In particular:* the ACH has a completely revamped website! http://ach.org/
* we invited everyone to express interest to get involved in ACH committees
* we discussed the success of DHAnswers and invited colleagues to
contribute http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/ Finally, we had two open discussion topics. The first was regarding a
possible name change for ACH. The Executive Council recognizes that
"Association of Computers and the Humanities" may not be as expressive
of contemporary digital humanities scholarship and teaching as it
might be. Some present pointed out the danger that the title may keep
new people away. However, the overwhelming tenor of the discussion was
that a change would present several logistical challenges and there
was a certain attachment to the historical context that the ACH
represents (much like the anachronistic sounding Association for
Computing Machinery). Moreover, using the acronym ACH somewhat masks
the details anyway.Second, we discussed possibilities for the ACH to partner with local
events to provide more continuous and more regional support and
presence for the ACH constituency. A whole range of suggestions were
offered and the ACH Exec will try experimenting with some of them and
report back about this next year.Thanks to all who were present and contributed![Please do not reply to this message as I use this address for
