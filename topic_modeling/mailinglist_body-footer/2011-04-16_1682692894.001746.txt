It depends if you are dependent on a particular tool to effect the sort. 
If not, it is quite normal to sort words in a case-insensitive or 
case-sensitive way, at will. You can even find this feature in some text 
editors, like this one http://www.editplus.com/ (but I am sure others 
will have other and better suggestions). If you want to program the sort 
yourself, the precise solution will depend on the language, but you 
should be able to do that alright.Best wishes,
Marjorie
