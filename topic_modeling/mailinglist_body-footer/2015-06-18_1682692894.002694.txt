Fourth AIUCD annual conference
17-19 December 2015
Campus Einaudi - Lungo Dora Siena 100 - 10153 Torino
The AIUCD 2015 conference is dedicated to investigate the relationship=20
between the Digital Humanities and the broad field of Cultural Heritage,=20
a line of research that is open since the inception of the former.
On the one hand, the Cultural Heritage domain has been using digital=20
tools, processes and methodologies for quite a long time, but their use=20
does not imply a recognition of their role as scientifically qualifying.
On the other hand, galleries, libraries, archives and museums preserve=20
and provide access to a wealth of content that is the object of much=20
research carried out as part of the Digital Humanities.
It is therefore interesting to see if Digital Humanities tools and=20
methods have led and will lead to a redefinition of theoretical,=20
methodological and technical processes, up to an actual=20
re-conceptualization of knowledge in the Cultural Heritage field.At least two issues indicate the existence of a connection: the=20
theoretical reflection on the management of information and data that=20
texts hold, which has been carried out as part of the management of=20
libraries, has important consequences for the whole wide area of the=20
Digital Humanities; in the context of research funding, the increasing=20

wide spread in the Cultural Heritage area. Furthermore, if on the one=20
hand the world of Cultural Heritage has started their own reflection=20
that also touches the Digital Humanities, on the other hand the Digital=20
Humanities are urged to communicate beyond the inner, often=20
self-referential,  circle of Academia, and to do this they are inspired=20
by the methods of communication and dissemination of knowledge that=20
belong to the Cultural Heritage world. In conclusion, a meeting of=20
Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage is already under way, it is=20
necessary to act and facilitate a cooperation that results in being as=20
effective as possible for both fields.As a sign of openness and willingness to cooperate with the Cultural=20

We are therefore soliciting papers in particular on =E2=80=93 but not limited=
 to=20
- the following topics:- Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage: integration, separation,=20
independence?
- what relationship among Museums, Libraries, Archives and Digital=20
Humanities?
- how do Digital Humanities fit in Museums, Archives and Galleries?

- experiences of projects using principles and methods of the semantic=20
