Wikipedia.  I'm a long-established editor and know the system pretty
well.  I will be happy to help out, if necessary.  My user page is here.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dbuckner
Edward BucknerPS I've been lurking in this group for a while but never posted. So,
hello.  My website is herehttp://uk.geocities.com/frege(a)btinternet.com/And you might be interested in my manuscripts page herehttp://uk.geocities.com/frege(a)btinternet.com/manuscripts/manuscripts.htmand one of the manuscripts (actually incunabula in this case) herehttp://uk.geocities.com/frege(a)btinternet.com/manuscripts/bonaventura/bon
aii37.htmBeware though there are many errors in the last one - a new version
going up at the end of this month.  My main interest is in deciphering
old manuscripts or books, setting them in 'modern' Latin script, and
attempting to translate into English.E Buckner--===============8930585656100748612==--
