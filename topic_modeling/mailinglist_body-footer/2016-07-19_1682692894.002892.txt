We are pleased to announce the launch of the *Beyond Words* website,
which provides information about dates, venues, public programming, the
symposium, and the catalogue of the upcoming exhibit *Beyond Words:
Illuminated Manuscripts in Boston Collections*:
http://BeyondWords2016.org
 
When the exhibit opens in mid-September, we will launch the object-
centered portion of the website: a searchable database of all 260
manuscripts described in the catalogue, with essential metadata and
images for each manuscript and, when available, codicological
descriptions and full digital facsimiles.
 
Please visit the website regularly for updates and, if you use Twitter,
follow @BeyondWords2016 for sneak-peeks, updates, and announcements. We
hope to see you in Boston this fall.
 
- The *Beyond Words* Curatorial Team: Jeffrey Hamburger, William P.
  Stoneman, Anne-Marie Eze, Lisa Fagin Davis, and Nancy Netzer
