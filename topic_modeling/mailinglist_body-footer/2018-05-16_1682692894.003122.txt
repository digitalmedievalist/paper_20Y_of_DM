The PIREH (University Paris 1 Panth=C3=A9on-Sorbonne) is organizing an intern=
ational conference on History and Text analysis, at the Sorbonne in Paris on =
January 17-19 2019.We are looking for papers, in English or in French, showing how historians ca=
n use different methods of text analysis (computational linguistics, text min=

Computational methods of text analysis (lexicometry, computational linguistic=
s, text mining, distant reading...) are undergoing important developments in =
many scientific fields and in society as a whole. Such methods can help and i=
nterest many different sectors (private companies, public governance, intelli=
gence, data-journalism, etc.). They are also assuming growing importance in t=
he humanities, especially among researchers of the digital humanities. This h=
as led to a number of conferences and regular scientific events, such as the =
French JADT (Journ=C3=A9es d'Analyse des Donn=C3=A9es textuelles), an=
d to several recent synthesis books (L=C3=A9on & Loiseau 2016, Jenset & McGil=
livray 2017).In this movement, the position of historians appears to be paradoxical. Their=
 work is largely based on texts used as sources and, following the evolutions=
 of modern historiography, they showed a growing interest in the discourses a=
nd representations of societies and individuals of the past. In this regard, =
the methodologies of text analysis in history enjoyed a fair success and prom=
inence in France as soon as the 1970s, especially at the Centre de lexicologi=
e politique of the ENS Fontenay/Saint-Cloud. However, despite the influence o=
f the linguistic turn and the development of more powerful and more accessibl=
e software, the use of text analysis in history have been less frequent latel=
y, even though such methods continue to prove useful (Genet, 2011). The limit=
ed presence of historians at the JADT is symptomatic of that.Nowadays, text analysis is regaining momentum thanks to text mining, which ca=
n help with sorting the massive amounts of textual data produced by the digit=
alization of sources (such as the project Corpus of the Biblioth√©que nat=
ionale de France =E2=80=93 Moiraghi 2018).The aim of this conference is to understand the current uses of computational=
 and statistical text analysis in history, at a time where the intellectual, =
social and technical context is changing. Several questions can be raised to =
better assess their use and their contribution to history.=20
1. The historiography of text analysisFor a long time, historians have thought about the way they can associate his=
tory, linguistics and statistics (Robin 1973 ; Guilhaumou, Maldidier, Robin 1=
994 ; Genet 2011 ; L=C3=A9on 2015 ; L=C3=A9on & Loiseau 2016), and this histo=
riographical current is not closed. One can go back to the fruitful moments o=
f this collaboration, such as the works of the center of political lexicology=
 of the ENS Fontenay/Saint-Cloud, or those of the laboratory of statistical l=
inguistics of the University of Nice. But it is worth asking why some scienti=
fic and intellectual enterprises that appeared promising at first did not eve=
ntually reach the same success, for example the works by Michel P=C3=AAcheux =
and Denise Maldidier. One can also consider the intellectual career of histor=
ians like Jacques Guilhaumou and R=C3=A9gine Robin, who began their research =
using lexical statistics before they turned their attention to methodologies =
closer to a more traditional conceptual history.=20
2. New methods for new corpora2.1. The new sources and objects of text analysisIn France, text analysis was originally used to analyze political and trade u=
nions texts. While this field of study is still active (Mayaffre 2010) and ca=
n even reach a general audience (Alduy 2017 ; Souchard, Wanich & Cuminal 1998=
), it is worth considering which other types of sources can be analyzed in th=
is way. Some languages have strong idiosyncrasies: the writing of charters, d=
iplomatic cables, or legal texts, for example. Others are characterized by th=
eir specific context of production (orality, private or intimate writings, li=
terary texts, etc.). Which questions and approaches are relevant for this kin=
d of material?A language can also be treated as an historical object by itself, especially =
when it is a tool of empowerment or domination. This is what Serge Lusignan h=
ighlighted with a qualitative approach in his essays of sociolinguistic histo=
ry (Lusignan 2004 and 2012). Similarly, the linguistic aspects of domination =
are central in gender history or in postcolonial studies. In this respect, wh=
at can text analysis offer ? How can such methods assist in grasping those di=
scursive phenomenons?At the same time, a number of fields in history were deeply influenced by the=
 archival turn (Clanchy 1979, and Chastang 2008 for example for the medieval =
history, or Guyotjeannin 1995). In this approach, sources are considered as a=
n object per se, and a greater attention is given to their mode of production=
 and their conditions of conservation, in order to better understand what the=
y say. Then, is text analysis less relevant, or can it help us shed a new lig=
ht on the document itself, its formal or material aspects, its genesis and it=
s evolutions?2.2. Text analysis, big data, and the historianWith the statistical approach of textual analysis, a representative and fairl=
y large corpus is needed in order to produce significant results. The ideal s=
ize of such a corpus is an open question, but one can wonder how it is possib=
le to study textual materials with different levels of magnification and comp=
lementary methods (data mining on big corpora vs. focused analysis of a speci=
fic lexicon, for example). Historians must reflect on this shift, now that th=
e corpora of digitalized and born-digital sources (such as websites) are rapi=
dly growing. How can they make those new materials their own, and what can th=
ey say, armed with their critical knowledge of sources, about their constitut=
ion and their use? Recent publications show this transformation can benefit h=
istorians of all periods (Perreaux 2014 in medieval history, for example) and=
 that it redefines the geography of historical research (Putnam 2016).3. The development of the statistical toolkit of text analysis3.1. TemporalityCorpora with a diachronic structure raise specific issues. The problem of ana=
chronism has long been tackled by historians working on such material (Prost =
1988), while more recent works have focused on the visualization of temporali=
ty (Ratinaud & Marchand 2014). In textual analysis, words can speak for thems=
elves and reveal a useful periodization for the historian's work. Som=
e statistical methods (Factorial analysis, topic modeling) can show the evolu=
tion of a lexicon, by highlighting words coming in and out of a corpus, but t=
he changes in their meaning itself still are difficult to grasp. What are the=
 means to perceive those semantic transformations? Also, how can we make use =
of discontinuous series of texts on a large timeframe? Such questions are imp=
ortant to the historian, who works on temporality by definition, but they are=
 also especially relevant when one considers digital writings, in so far as t=
hey are frequently organized chronologically (such as Facebook or Twitter pos=
ts). =203.2. Innovative algorithms for text analysisSince the seminal book by Lebart and Salem (Lebart & Salem 1994), a common se=
t of statistical concepts and tools has been used by researchers and implemen=
ted in free softwares, but new methodologies offer innovative ways to analyze=
 a corpus. In addition to topic models (Barron et alii, 2018), a tool like Li=
nkage (http://linkage.fr <http://linkage.fr/>) uses written exchanges to buil=
d a classification of a social network, while some deep learning algorithms r=
elying on word vectors (Embedding Layer, Word2Vec, GloVe) can provide a summa=
ry and a comparison of documents very quickly (Levy & Goldberg, 2014). How ca=
n those new methods be used by historians?3.2. Qualitative and quantitative approachesThe computer tools available to social scientists for linguistic investigatio=
ns are not necessarily based on statistics. Softwares like Nooj make a precis=
e formalization of natural languages possible, thus enriching the comprehensi=
on of a language in a given state and through time.On a broader level, one must also acknowledge the role of qualitative approac=
hes. Their association with quantitative methods is a fruitful one (Paveau 20=
12) and they must be taken into account to fully address the possible relatio=
nships between languages and history. Contributions illustrating and discussi=
ng the benefits of those different methods in history will be most welcome.
