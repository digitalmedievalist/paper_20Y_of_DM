and much improved version within a month or so; we are also actively 
trying to develop  training material to accompany it (there's a very 
preliminary initial draft at http://www.tei-c.org/Drafts/edw88.xml)The version of Roma online at http://www.tei-c.org/Roma should be 
reasonably stable however and I will do my best to sort out any problems 
that are reported using it.Roma is very definitely intended to generate DTDs as well as schemas, 
and we have never suggested that it was a "schema-only" tool. However, 
there are (in the nature of things) some things which DTDs cannot do and 
schemas  can, which in turn has led to some bugs in the DTD generation 
part of the current online version.At present Roma's author, Sebastian Rahtz, is in a part of  the world 
blessed with only sporadic email contact, which means that bugs don't 
get fixed quite as rapidly as they would if he were here, nor when fixed 
do they necessarily get propagated to the publicly accessible servers as 
rapidly as they would if I didn't have 99 other jobs to do as well.Nevertheless, if you would like to send me a copy of the misbehaving ODD 
you mention, I'd be very glad to advise. Just make the modifications you 
want, and then press the Save button (rather than the Schema button): 
this will save your modification specification as an ODD in XML format. 
Send me that.Lou Burnard
