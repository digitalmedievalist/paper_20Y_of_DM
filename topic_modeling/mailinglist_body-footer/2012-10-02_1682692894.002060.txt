***Greetings! Please join us Wednesday, October 3rd for a digital library
brown bag presentation by Dot Porter. The presentation will be held at
the Herman B Wells Library, room E174, from 12:00-1:00--------------
Medievalists' Use of Digital Resources and the Development of MESA Dot
Porter, Associate Director for Digital Library Content and Services
Digital Library Program Wells Library, Room E174The Medieval Electronic Scholarly Alliance (MESA) is a federated
international community of scholars, project, institutions, and
organizations engaged in digital scholarship within the field of
medieval studies. Funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, MESA
seeks both to provide a community for those engaged in digital
medieval studies and to meet emerging needs of this community,
including making recommendations on technological and scholarly
standards for electronic scholarship, the aggregation of data, and the
ability to discover and repurpose this data.This presentation will focus on the discovery aspect of MESA, and how
it might serve the non-digital medievalist who may nevertheless be
interested in finding and using digital resources. Starting with a
history of medievalists and their interactions with digital technology
as told through three data sets (the International Congress on
Medieval Studies (first held in 1962), arts-humanities.net (a digital
project database in the UK, sponsored by JISC and the Arts &
Humanities Research Council), and two surveys, from 2002 and 2011,
that looked specifically at medievalists' use of digital resources), I
will draw out some potential issues that this history has for the
current developers of digital resources for medievalists, and
investigate how MESA might serve to address these issues.--------------
Presentation slides and audio will be available via the Connect
