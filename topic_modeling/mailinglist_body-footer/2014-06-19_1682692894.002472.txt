Public Archaeology in a Digital AgeALL WELCOME
This paper will discuss the need for diverse archaeological communities 
to widen participation and engage new audiences on a more collaborative 
platform. The paper will discuss the results of my doctoral research, 
which has provided data that can be used to improve user experience, 
engagement and participation with archaeology and other heritage 
subjects via Internet technologies, and embed usability and 
sustainability within digital archaeological projects. Understanding the 
impact of participatory media will aid archaeologists and those in the 
heritage fields to promote the advantages of digital engagement and 
public collaboration, in terms of economic benefit, social justice, 
learning outcomes, diversifying audiences and the promotion of social 
inclusion.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please see the seminar website at
