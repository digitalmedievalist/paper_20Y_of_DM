Executive Board elections for 2011.In this case re-elected were:
 Malte Rehbein
 Peter Stokes
 Torsten Scha√üanAnd newly joining us is:
 Dominique StutzmannThe other candidates all scored very highly and it was a close run
race. I would like to thank the other candidates for allowing their
names to be placed on the ballot.  Having such a good slate of
qualified people wanting to assist DM to further its goals is
demonstrative of its stability as a community. It is always hard to
get the balance of continuity of service and new input, and the board
will be discussing several possible changes that might benefit DM
inthis area.  Members of the public are always welcome to volunteer to
assist DM in its various goals without being Board members, and I
would encourage any of you who want to get more involved to email us.These election results cannot be announced without mentioning the one
DM Board member who chose not to stand for re-election. Daniel
O'Donnell has been fundamental in progressing Digital Medievalist to
its current state. It is he who set up a mailing list in 2003 on best
practice for digital medieval resource creation with others such as
Peter Baker, Martin Foys, Murray McGillivray and Elizabeth Solopova
that eventually led to the creation of the DM-L mailing list. It was
Dan who helped the DM Journal start and thrive, and helped us move
towards a more open and fully-elected Executive Board. Although Dan
was already DM's leader he served as its elected director from our
first elections in 2007 until 2009. It is his continued ongoing
commitment to DM that helps convince the University of Lethbridge to
allow us to have a virtual machine which runs the
www.digitalmedievalist.org website (and various other DM
infrastructure). Simply put, without Dan, we wouldn't be here!  Thanks
Dan for your commitment to DM and continued support of it.As part  of the election survey we asked a question as to what DM
could do in the future to serve you, the DM community, better. We
received a wide and varied selection of comments, and the DM Board
will be discussing these to see how we may act on them. But feel free
contact us at any time with suggestions, proposals to host DM events,
or similar via board _at-sign_ digitalmedievalist.org.Thank you to all of you who voted, while the turnout was good compared
to previous elections, it would still be better to get a larger
turnout in the future.Many thanks,James Cummings (Director, Digital Medievalist)
