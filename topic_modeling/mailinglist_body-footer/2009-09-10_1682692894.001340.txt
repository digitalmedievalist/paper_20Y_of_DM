Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableFellow Digital Medievalists,=20I recently created Old English and Old Norse custom keyboard layouts for Wind=
ows intended to be simple for those familiar with the standard US English key=
board layout. These keyboard layouts are ready to use and easy to install. Pl=
ease read more and download them here:=20http://megse.unm.edu/research/internal/keyboards.htmlAlso, feel free to distribute them among your colleagues and students (but pl=
ease credit me and the UNM Medieval Graduate Students in English website).=20I have also linked to Daniel O'Donnell's custom keyboard solu=
tion for Linux.=20There certainly are many ways to insert the special characters of our field i=
nto documents, and my Old English and Old Norse layouts are just another meth=
od. With that in mind, Dan and I have been talking about custom keyboards for=
 medievalists and think it would be a good idea to design a standardized layo=
ut. Through the semester, we will be working on some aspects of the design, s=
uch as which characters should be included, how they should be mapped to the =
keyboard, and whether it is preferable to create one layout for medievalists =
or separate keyboards for sub-fields. We would very much like to hear your fe=
edback on this project, both now and as it develops, as we hope the final pro=
duct will be something agreeable and useful to the digital medievalist commun=
ity.=20Douglas Ryan VanBenthuysenThe University of New Mexico=20
