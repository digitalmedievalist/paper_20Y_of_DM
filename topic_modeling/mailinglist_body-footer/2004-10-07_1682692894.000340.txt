Unix to prepare your text file.Your file is in a particular character set. If you have only typed in
unaccented characters and haven't used things like directional quotes then
you will have only used 7-bit ASCII (which is a subset of many other
character sets).The file is intended to be XML. That implies that certain
sequences of typed characters have a particular meaning to an XML
interpreter. For example < indicates the start of a tag. An XML interpreter
needs to know the character set a file is in so that it can understand all
the characters in it. There are many different character sets in the world
and it is unlikely that an interpreter can understand them all. The default
character set for XML is UTF-8 (Unicode transformation format using
sequences of 8 bits) If you want to use a different character set you have
to declare it in the XML header and the interpreter must support it.UTF-8 was picked as the default for XML because by design the first 128
characters in Unicode have exactly the same byte values in UTF-8 as are used
in 7-bit ASCII. In other words if you type in a file on most systems which
doesn't use character codes over 127, not only is it an ASCII file, it also
a UTF-8 file.Since not all character sets include all the characters in the UCS, XML
provides an alternative way of representing them rather than just typing
them in. This is the &#x1090; format you mention above. So instead of typing
"the" I could type "&#x0074;&#x0068;&#0065;" instead, which is the same but
more long winded. This is not UCS-4 encoding, simply a way of indicating the
abstract numbers assigned to the characters.The byte sequence for &#x1090; in your file is 26 23 78 31 30 39 30 3B. If
your file was stored in UCS-4 that same sequence of characters would be the
byte sequence 00 00 00 26 00 00 00 23 00 00 00 78 00 00 00 31 00 00 00 30 00
00 00 39 00 00 00 30 00 00 00 3B. If instead of typing in the &#x; reference
you had just typed the character directly from your keyboard then it would
be 00 00 10 90 in that hypothetical UCS-4 file.=20

I am wondering if open office is simply telling you that the only character
set supported for the file is UTF-8. If so you may not have any worries -
just try using your file as is.Regards,   Tim--=20
