rams which they can then modify to suit their needs (a recipe book approach).although this seems to be perfectly reasonable,> I think that a procedural language like Perl is easier to grasp than XSLT a=
nd to learn.I wonder how to prove this? Learning a (another) procedural language=20
might be easier for someone who already learned a procedural language,=20
but I find the way XSLT work so quite straight forward that once you=20
understood how XML works it might be easy to understand XSLT too?! If=20
you learned object oriented programming like Java, XML-processing with=20
XSLT, XPath etc seems to be very similar?But I admit it might be only me estimating this?Best, Torsten--=20
