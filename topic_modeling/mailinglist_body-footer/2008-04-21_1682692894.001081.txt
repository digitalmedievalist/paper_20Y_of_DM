Hash: SHA1Dear colleagues,please cross-post this reminder as the deadline for nominations is
approaching. Notice that different from what has been announced so far,
I will act as returning officer.Digital Medievalist will be holding elections at the end of this month
for four positions to its board. Board positions are for two year terms
and incumbents may be re-elected. Members of the board are responsible
for the over all direction of the organisation and leading the Digital
Medievalist's many projects and programmes. With the election of these
four positions, Digital Medievalist will complete its transition from an
investigator-driven project to a community-governed organisation.
Information about the organisation, including its bylaws, is available
at http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/ (see particularly
http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/about/)We are now seeking nominations (including self-nominations) for these
vacancies. In order to be eligible for election, candidates must be
members of Digital Medievalist (membership is conferred by subscription
to the organisation's mailing list, dm-l(a)uleth.ca).If you are interested in running for these positions or are able to
recommend a suitable candidate, please contact the returning officer,
Torsten Scha√üan, at schassan(a)hab.de. The nomination period will close at
0000 UTC Thursday April 24 and elections will be held by electronic
ballot through the end of the week of April 28th, 2008.Best, Torsten
