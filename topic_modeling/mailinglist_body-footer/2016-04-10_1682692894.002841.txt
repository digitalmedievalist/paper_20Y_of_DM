one where the superb digitization project of 2009 (the year it was placed
online), the Codex Sinaiticus Project, helped reveal some amazing elements.
In a sense this very set of questions is a thank you to the digital
contribution to manuscript study.    First, allow me to explain that the Codex Sinaiticus has a: highly
problematical provenance with no substance before the 1840s allegations in
the 1860s that Sinaiticus was a modern manuscript allegations in the 1860s
that there had been colouring of the ms in the 1850s to make it look
older creative
and suspicious fabrications surround its discovery and procurement.     And
Sinaiticus has an unusual palaeographic dating history. The 4th-century
date was pushed very aggressively, with minimal science, by its
"discoverer" Constantine Tischendorf. This dating was quickly *set in stone*
in textual circles by 1870-1880 despite various objections, minor and
major.  The palaeographic dating was based almost entirely on the pictures
and descriptions in facsimile book editions, editions by Tischendorf that
omitted salient facts about the manuscript's condition.  Tischendorf also
included lots of theorizing on soft evidences, the script (a standard
easy-to-emulate script) and the textual components.  Hardly anybody was
actually viewing and handling the manuscript.  This situation is still true
today, except that the Codex Sinaiticus Project allowed for viewing the ms.
online and included solid numerical representations about items like colour
and thickness and numerous other features.   The digitization revealed the fact that the two sections of the
manuscript were different, in ways that are major anomalies. 1844 -  43
leaves -  Leipzig - Codex Friderico-Augustanus - pristine white parchment -
all leaves the same colour 1859 - 347 leaves - St.
Petersburg-->England-1933 -          "yellow with age"            - unusual
colour variance in the leaves        A gentleman named David R. Smith has
been studying Codex Fuldensis (it might be a couple of hundreds years later
than commonly accepted) and made a salient comment:  "I do not trust palaeography to prove an old date, but I do trust it to
disprove such a date.
   It is easy to imitate what is antique, but impossible to predict what
will be novel."    Palaeography is a non-symmetrical discipline, in terms of time
chronology. Some professional palaeographers, especially Brent Nongbri,
have been making this point on the common early papyri dating, that the
range of years is often far too restrictive (in that case the issue is
usually a couple of hundred years of range.) And all the researchers
involved in identifying forgeries and replicas are very aware of this basic
fact.  However, in Bible textual manuscript dating, it is often left out of
view.    Here is one basic concern, parchment manuscripts yellow with age and
use: Gavin Moorhead: The colour of parchment varies with animal type,
making process and condition or state of decline. *New parchment can be
near white but as it ages or is exposed to detrimental factors it will
start to yellow* and go brown-black if left to degrade completely. The
colour change can also be influenced by the type of degradation and degree
of gelatinization      Now  we get to a key point.* Leipzig is white
parchment*, it "forgot" to yellow.  Overturning the known chemical
processes that we can see on manuscript after manuscript.  This was hidden
from view publicly until after 2009, it was never mentioned in the
Sinaiticus literature. (Porfiry Uspensky references this about the 1845
full manuscript before it was separated to two major sections, and Ernst
von Dobschütz mentioned the Leipzig section as snow-white parchment in o=
ne
publication in 1910.)   And this was never mentioned in the context of all
the literature about palaeographic dating, from Tischendorf to Lake to
Skeat & Milne to Parker and others today.   *This white parchment anomaly alone should ring loud alarm bells, and
should cause a full reappraisal of the dating of Sinaiticus*.   Then you
add the flexible and supple condition, and then you add the colouring
discussed below.  Note that there had been tests planned on these Leipzig pages for April
2015 by BAM, * Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfungin* =
in
Berlin, a group which studied carefully the parchment and ink of the Dead
Sea Scrolls.  *The Leipzig University Library cancelled those plans*.
Today, Leipzig does not want to discuss anything at all about the
manuscript condition and history of conservation.  (The British Library, to
their credit, has engaged in open discussion, with various theories and
conjectures about the unusual elements of the manuscript. Although for them
the possibility of non-antiquity is an *elephant in the living room*.)   So where does this leave us today?
   Here you can see the wonderful condition of Sinaiticus.  Flexible,
supple, not at all brittles.   The Codex Sinaiticus: The Oldest Surviving

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DU4Xkv2gjzZw   Sinaiticus in some cases used
as the exemplar for parchment and ink longevity.  * If Sinaiticus is
actually a modern production, the discipline and integrity of parchment
conservation science is compromised. *Thus, even if textual critics, a
somewhat cloistered group with their own peculiar areas of emphasis, are
slow to consider the implications, the professionals in manuscript
conservation and the related chemical sciences that are applied to
manuscripts should have real concern.=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D    Another major point.  I have barely referenced the compelling evidence
that *the British pages taken from Sinai in 1859 were coloured by
hand, *perhaps
using lemon-juice, matching the 1860s accusation. That was actually the
first point that glared out at us as researchers.  Why was there such a
marked difference between Leipzig and the British Library pages?  If you
look at these two sites, you can learn a lot about the colouring. Codex

and compelling.
   We find the very simplicity is difficult for those in the scholarly and
