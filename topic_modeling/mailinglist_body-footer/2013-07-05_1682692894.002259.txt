*Centre for e-Research Seminar Series*The CeRch seminars provide a venue for discussion and engagment of a 
range of projects, applications, methods and theories spanning the 
Centre's academic interests in computing, library and archives research, 
digital culture, information science and digital scholarship.With viewpoints from many disciplines including the sciences, social 
sciences and humanities, the series' primary focus is to stimulate 
discussion and provide new and innovative insight into the design, 
development and use of digitally-based methods and technologies, 
especially where they interact with a range of other fields.
Previous topics have included digital manuscript studies, visualisation, 
webometrics, computer art, motion data, and network analysis, among many 
others (details of recent seminars in this series can be seen at 
http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/cerch/research/seminars/.)The series invites contributions for talks engaging with innovative 
e-research questions or applications. The series provides excellent 
networking opportunities, and will be of interest to anyone interested 
in debates around computing technologies.Seminars are held fortnightly on Tuesdays during term time at 6.15pm 
(unless otherwise stated) in the Anatomy Theatre & Museum, at King's 
College London, Strand Campus 
(http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cultural/spaces/anatomy-museum.aspx). Seminars are 
followed by drinks and nibbles./Twitter: @KingsCeRch     hashtag: #cerchseminars/--
