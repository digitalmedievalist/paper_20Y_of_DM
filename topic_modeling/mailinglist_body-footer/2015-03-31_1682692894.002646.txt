IncunabulaConference on 30 June-1 July 2015 at the CTS, De Montfort
University, LeicesterCall for Papers*Printing technology spread all over Europe shortly after its invention in
the 1450s, and yet manuscript culture continued to thrive in the incunabula
period and beyond. Scribes and printers both used manuscripts and printed
books in order to produce new copies, while early book owners often
assembled and bound manuscript and print material together, resulting in
the production of hybrid books. The incunabulum was a product of
hand-craftsmen at various stages, and each copy, even of the same edition,
has its own unique history of over 500 years. Recent studies of
copy-specific information in incunabula have revealed the close
relationship among producers, readers and owners.The objective of this conference is two-fold: to disseminate advanced
research of copy-specific features and to facilitate further collaboration
of scholarship and integration of data. In this conference, copy specifics
are broadly defined as all the 'marks' found in individual copies: the
collation, the distribution of paper-stock, stop-press correction variants,
hand-decorations, binding, unintentional damages such as worm-holes, traces
of censorship, and intentional marks left by readers and both individual
and institutional owners.We invite *proposals for short papers (15 minutes)* on any aspect of
*copy-specific
features of incunabula*. Papers from postgraduate students and early career
researchers are particularly welcome, and there will be *bursaries* available
for postgraduate students and early career researches to present their
papers.Please send *proposal abstracts of 300-500 words* with contact details and
affiliation to *Takako Kato <tkato(a)dmu.ac.uk <tkato(a)dmu.ac.uk>> by 30 Apr=
il
2015*.*Conference programme**Plenary speakers*: Lotte Hellinga (Former Deputy Keeper, the British
Library) and David Pearson (Director, Culture, Heritage and Libraries at
City of London).*Invited speakers*: Cristina Dondi, Kate Loveman, Laura Nuvoloni, Ed Potten

Humanities, the British Library).*Launch of 'Caxton and Beyond*: Copy-Specific Material of English
Incunabula', an online interface created by Takako Kato and Satoko Tokunaga.*Visit to the Special Collections* in the University of Leicester Library
to consult incunabula (optional).The Conference is supported by Modern Humanities Research Association,
