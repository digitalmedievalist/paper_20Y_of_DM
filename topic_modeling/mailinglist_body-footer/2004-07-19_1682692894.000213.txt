Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitDear everyoneI sent this message last week but it failed to spark any discussion.  Has
*anyone* used TEI to encode information about 'museum-like' objects, such as
swordguards, armour, the like?  Or, has anyone used XML at all for this, for
encoding of information about the individual objects (not the collections, a
task for EAD)? Or, has anyone seen or heard of or ever known of an
initiative to develop  XML encoding in these areas? CIMI did do it a while
ago, but seems to have perished.Has anyone had any experience of using tei to encode information about maps
and various other objects? We are talking to a group who want to record
information about maps and sword guards, etc, in a collection otherwise
encoded in tei.  Most of what they need is in <bibl> but some things are
not.
Here is a roughish specimens of what they are looking at, adapting existing
tei structures, for maps:<listBibl.map><bibl.map> <imprint> <pubPlace></pubPlace>
