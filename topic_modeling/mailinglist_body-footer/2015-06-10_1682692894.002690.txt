world_This session will also be live-cast to the YouTube channel:

One of the primary obstacles to conducting geospatial analysis of 
relevant documents (both maps and texts) is identifying the places to 
which they refer. Recogito is a user-friendly Web-based tool developed 
to enable: first the “geotagging” of place names either on maps or in 
digital texts; then the “georesolving” of those places to an appropriate 
gazetteer. Not only does this step provide geographical coordinates; by 
mapping to an authority file (a gazetteer), the documents are also 
connected to the Pelagios linked data network. All metadata are free and 
downloadable to the public as CSV files or maps.Full programme: http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2015.html*ALL WELCOME*The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.--
