This is to let you know that the deadline for the submission of papers 
for the ESTS conference ‘Editing Fundamentals: Historical and Literary 
Paradigms in Source Editing’ (Amsterdam, November 22-24, 2012) has been 
extended. Proposals should be submitted before June 1, 2012. Decisions 
about acceptance will be communicated before July 1, 2012.The 9th conference of the European Society for Textual Scholarship will 
be an international academic forum for communication between different 
approaches to historical and literary source editing. Edited source 
texts, documents and databases are essential to literary, political, 
historical scholarship, as well as to social studies, art history, 
music, philosophy or theology. The conference aims at bringing together 
academics working in disciplines that have so far worked within 
independently operating scholarly traditions, promoting innovative, 
multidisciplinary exchange and dialogue. The conference will examine the 
transformation of traditional editorial practice into a digital 
environment and the creation of innovative opportunities like the use of 
digital tools and media.Scholars of any discipline related to editing texts and data nowadays 
have at their disposal almost limitless possibilities to present texts 
and data to the public. Traditionally reflection and practice show 
seemingly different approaches to textual scholarship and documentary 
editing of historical sources. The aim of this conference is to debate 
these topics and to strive for a common approach towards the challenges 
of publishing. Key concepts are heuristic, selection, representativeness 
and presentation to the user.The conference is organized by the European Society for Textual 
Scholarship (ESTS) and the Huygens Institute for the History of the 
Netherlands (Huygens ING), a Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and 
Sciences institute.Keynote speakers:
Manfred Thaller (University of Cologne)
Godfried Croenen (University of Liverpool)
Andrew Jewell (University of Nebraska-Lincoln)For all other information about the conference, see
