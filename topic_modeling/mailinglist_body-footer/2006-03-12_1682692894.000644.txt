Description module.[1]  This is really the outcome of the most recent 
work, based on the work of the groups you note and provides some very 
good ways to record all the metadata one might about a manuscript.[2] 
  That module, combined with the other innovations in others (like 
<choice> and <g>) which are a boon to the transcription of primary 
sources, means that if one was starting an edition of a manuscript, 
then this is what I'd choose.  (In fact, what I have chosen for one 
I'm currently working on.)-James[1] See the text of the guidelines for this module at 
http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/html/MS.html
[2] There is an article on TEI's Manuscript Description module in the 
upcoming issue of the Digital Medievalist journal.
