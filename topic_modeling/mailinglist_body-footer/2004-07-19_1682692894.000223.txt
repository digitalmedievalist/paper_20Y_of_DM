project? I don't know him well enough to ask, but I'd say probably not,=20
if his professional life is financed the way that of most professors is.=20
Rather, he got a grant from an agency (public or non-profit) that is not=20
asking to be reimbursed. Who paid for all that programming? Possibly the=20
press, which will want its money back, but if the same programming is=20
being used by OUP, which is selling Junius 11 at a fraction of the cost,=20
I doubt it: If I were Exeter UP and I had paid for the programming, I'd=20
be demanding a fee that would jack up the price of the Junius CD and=20
lower my own price. No, I'll bet that the programming was paid for by=20
Bernard's university or some granting agency--which, in that case, is=20
not looking for its money back.So what explains the difference in price? Sorry, not the amount of=20
material: the books contain approximately the same number of folios=20
(Exeter 123 folios; Junius 229 pp., or 115 folios). Perhaps the two=20
presses are thinking very differently about prices and profits: Exeter=20
remembering what Rosenkilde and Bagger used to charge for EEMF volumes=20
and OUP thinking about the actual cost of producing the CD. Or maybe=20
Exeter Cathedral is charging a high royalty while the Bod is charging a=20
low one (but my experience of both libraries suggests that that is=20
unlikely). Truly, I can't explain it.As to the general point about free electronic resources vs. ones you pay=20
for, I think there is room in the world for both. There are good reasons=20
to charge for electronic resources; but I hope there will always be a=20
place for free resources as well, and I am heartened that so much=20
high-quality material is available on the web. For my own part, I'd like=20
for any electronic resources I produce to be freely available.PeterAbdullah Alger wrote:>Digital Medievalist Journal (Inaugural Issue Fall 2004). Call for papers: ht=
