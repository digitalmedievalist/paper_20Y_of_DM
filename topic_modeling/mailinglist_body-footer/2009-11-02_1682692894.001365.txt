to outgoing network problems at the University of Lethbridge, where
the site is hosted. The newsfeed for the site is hosted elsewhere (at
wordpress.com) and imported into the DM site as an atom feed.  The
XInclude fallback (that says the news is temporarily unavailable) was
not being displayed reliably in all cases, and this was have a
derogatory effect on the rest of the site.  Now that uleth.ca is again
seeing the outside world the problem seems to have rectified itself,
but we will be taking steps to attempt to minimize such disruptions in
the future.Apologies to anyone who attempted to use the site in the meantime.Sincerely,Dr James Cummings
Director, Digital Medievalist
