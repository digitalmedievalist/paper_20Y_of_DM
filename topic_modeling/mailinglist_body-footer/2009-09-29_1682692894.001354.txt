Artifact and Script: digital approaches to inscribed surfaces', to be
held at the e-Science Institute in Edinburgh on (Thursday and Friday)
8-9 October, 2009. (Programme will be posted at
http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/1014/ .)The event description follows:The text upon an object is both evidence for and part of its form and
therefore its function; just as the construction and purpose of an
object gives context to and aids in the interpretation of text. Indeed,
the form of an object effects the placement and design of text and
decoration upon it. Non-verbal decorations drawn or painted on an object
fall somewhere between (2-D) text and (3-D) physical object: like the
text they are added by the scribe or artist, they have semantic (if not
verbal) connotation, and are often taken out of the material context of
the object; like the object, however, they are considered as artistic
and visual content, and are hard to digitize meaningfully. Nevertheless
they sometimes come closest to crossing the artificial boundary and may
be studied by both philologists and archaeologists. Text may also be
constrained by the placement of decoration on a surface, or vice versa.This conference will bring together scholars from a variety of fields
who study objects and texts side by side to discuss the ways in which
advanced computer science methods can enhance both their own work and
the nature of their collaborations with other researchers working on the
same objects.Methods to be considered will include (but need not be restricted to): * Linking/connecting text and images of objects within digital
editions/projects, or making object description an intrinsic part of a
text edition;
 * Advanced imaging (3D surface scanning, multi-spectral imaging,
non-invasive volumetric scanning, stereographic/photogrammetric imaging)
to bring lost or damaged text/engraving out of objects;
 * Automated text/character analysis; identification of text
fields/columns/lines;
 * Reconstruction and visualization of damaged, unclear or complex
text-bearing objects;
 * Digital placing of objects in historical and archaeological contexts
to highlight textual/non-textual features.If you are interested in attending this event, please register on the
eSI website, and confirmation will be sent you as soon as possible.Regards,Gabriel Bodard
