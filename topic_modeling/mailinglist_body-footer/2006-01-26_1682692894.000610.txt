on TEI and XML on 20th/21st February 2006. Although this is part of
our regular  IT Learning Program, we'd also be happy to see folks
from outside Oxford University.The teachers are Lou Burnard, James Cummings and Sebastian Rahtz.
Between us, we'll talk about XML, text encoding, the TEI scheme, Roma,
XPath, XQuery, XSLT, and anything else which comes up. Throughout, we'll be
addressing TEI P5 only.Details at http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/courses/detail.xsp?code=TWDAThose from outside the University of Oxford can register by emailing:
