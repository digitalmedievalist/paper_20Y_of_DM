and jumbled sentences, and there's a fair amount of interactivity in terms 
of showing feedback on user input, offering hints, scoring and so on. 
Another of our apps, Quandary, produces action mazes (branching decision 
trees) in a similar format:<http://www.halfbakedsoftware.com/quandary/version_2/examples/>You can View Source to see any of the JavaScript code; you'll see large 
blocks of JavaScript that's basically used to manipulate the page DOM to 
hide and show questions and answers, show responses, modify parts of the 
page, and so on.Cheers,
Martin
