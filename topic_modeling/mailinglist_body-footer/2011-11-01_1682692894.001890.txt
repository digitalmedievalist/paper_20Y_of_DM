medieval vernacular texts and cultures. Founded by Stephen G. Nichols and
Nadia R. Altschul, the journal aims to foster scholarship that crosses
disciplines upsetting traditional fields of study, national boundaries and
periodizations. Digital Philology also encourages both applied and
theoretical research that engages with the digital humanities and shows why
and how digital resources require new questions, new approaches, and yield
radical results.  Beginning in 2012 Digital Philology will have two issues per year, published
by the Johns Hopkins University Press. One of the issues will be open to all
submissions, while the other one will be guest-edited and revolve around a
thematic axis. Contributions may take the form of a scholarly essay or focus on the study
of a particular manuscript. Articles must be written in English, follow the
3rd edition (2008) of the MLA style manual, and be between 5,000 and 7,000
words in length, including footnotes and list of works cited. Quotations in
the main text in languages other than English should appear along with their
English translation.  Digital Philology is welcoming submissions for its 2013 open issue.
Inquiries and submissions (as a Word document attachment) should be sent to
dph(a)jhu.edu, addressed to the Managing Editor (Albert Lloret). Digital
Philology will also publish manuscript studies and reviews of books and
digital projects. Correspondence regarding manuscript studies may be
addressed to Jeanette Patterson at jpatterson09(a)gmail.com. Correspondence
regarding digital projects and publications for review may be addressed to
Timothy Stinson at tlstinson(a)gmail.com.  Editors and Editorial Board Albert Lloret, Managing Editor                                         University of Massachusetts Amherst Jeanette Patterson, Manuscript Studies Editor Johns Hopkins University Timothy Stinson, Review Editor                                       North Carolina State University Nadia R.
