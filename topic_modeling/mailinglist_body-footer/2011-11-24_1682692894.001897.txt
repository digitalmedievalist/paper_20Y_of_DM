rs as we develop our new web service, Manuscripts Online. You will be able to=
 do the testing remotely, at four points during the next 12 months, and your =
responses will be recorded via an online survey. Working with us will enable =
you to have direct input into how Manuscript Online evolves. We are particula=
rly interested in obtaining input from anyone who teaches, studies or underta=
kes research into any aspect of medieval English language, literature and his=
tory.If you are interested in acting as one of our testers, please email hri-suppo=
