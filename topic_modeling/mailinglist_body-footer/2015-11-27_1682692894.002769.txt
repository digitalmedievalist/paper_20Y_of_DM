looking for, is the catalogue of papyri at the University of Michigan, 
which is accessible both as a local catalogue 
(http://quod.lib.umich.edu/a/apis?page=index) and through the 
Papyri.info portal (http://papyri.info/search?COLLECTION=michigan). I 
think the data/metadata contained by the two sites is more or less the 
same, but Michigan may also maintain some catalogue data that isn't 
included in the APIS format that Papyri.info serve.(I picked Michigan at random, but I'm sure at least a few of the other 
contributing APIS institutions [http://papyri.info/browse/apis/] also 
serve their collections locally as well as through Papyri.info.)Hope this helps,Gabby
