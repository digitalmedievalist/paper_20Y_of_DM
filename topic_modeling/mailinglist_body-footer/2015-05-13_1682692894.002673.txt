International Congress on Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo for a hands-on
workshop devoted to learning the basics of using MESA and submitting a
project for membership in the federation. The workshop will be led by Dot
Porter and Tim Stinson and will cover creating an account, faceted
searching, tagging and collecting digital objects, building exhibitions,
and creating and submitting RDF metadata. Teachers interested in using MESA
in the classroom, project directors and participants interested in
submitting a project for review and inclusion in MESA, and researchers
looking for pointers on how to navigate our growing federated content are
all encouraged to attend. There will be something for everyone!The MESA workshop will be held Friday, May 15 at 10 AM in Waldo Library
Classroom A.--
