to me a preposterous conclusion. As mark up is in use as a means of data 
exchange in many more domains than digital editing alone, it is in no way 
possible to call it obsolete. Moreover, facsimile of manuscript material can 
hardly be called machine readable. As long as OCR is not able to 
'understand' handwriting, transcription and mark up will proof its uses for 
the humanities domain.However, as good digital humanities scholars we should always question our 
mark up practice as progression in information technology is made. Because 
Peter is my colleague I know he favors handcrafted TEI mark up as a means of 
simultaneously structuring ones thoughts about a text as well as the text 
itself. This might be. But arguably tagging text according to TEI guidelines 
(or any other standard for that matter) is a laborious and potentially 
frustrating task, especially when you're a newby on the job. From experience 
I can tell that TEI is hardly the way to win over 'digital dummies' to the 
digital humanities side of the broader argument.I do think that numerable emerging projects (like Kevin Kiernan's 'Edition 
Production Tool' (EPT) and Sebastian Rahtz' Open Office TEI filter) are 
doing an increasingly good job at both abstracting away form the 
TEI-particulars and hiding the major amount of time and work involved in 
applying XML by hand. Which is what good software tools should be all about: 
abstracting from technical particulars and supporting any process in such a 
way the it becomes faster, more efficient and easier to use. Thus providing 
the tools that answer to the scholars intuition when handling and 
structuring text, seems a good way forward to me. That mark up recedes into 
the background due to such abstracting developments is a good thing. Just 
like you don't need to know the XML particulars of an OTD-XML file to write 
a perfectly comprehensible letter in Open Office, you shouldn't need to know 
the TEI-XML particulars when structuring a text for literary research 
purposes. The research value is in the act of structuring, not in the 
particular tagset used and not even in the mark up model applied.So I'd say there's indeed a paradox. Bolton is right in that TEI should 
become obsolete in the foreground of digital scholarly edition tools. But as 
TEI/XML recedes from the editing screen to the file, it will of course in no 
way become obsolete as a perfectly good means of storing edition material. 
But sadly, Bolton (as qouted by Dan at least) does not appear to have come 
to this kind of perception. She just seems to forward XML to oblivion 
because she now can see a scanned original.
 
Yours sincerely,
Joris--===============8861082793689328736==
