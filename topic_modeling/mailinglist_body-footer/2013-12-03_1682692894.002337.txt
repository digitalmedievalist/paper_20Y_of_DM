Digital Philology 2.2. This is a special issue edited by Deborah McGrady and
devoted to Rethinking the Boundaries of Patronage. It includes essays by
Jeanette Patterson on the Bible historiale, Andrea Tarnowski on de Mézières
Epistre lamentable, Amy N. Vines on Hoccleves Series, and Helen Swift on
defenses of women. Additionally, the Fall 2013 issue of DPh features an
article on Auerbachs counterphilology, by James I. Porter, and an essay
reviewing the terminology used to describe manuscripts, by Tjamke Snijders.
Five reviews of digital projects close the volume.  Here is the link to the
Table of Contents:
