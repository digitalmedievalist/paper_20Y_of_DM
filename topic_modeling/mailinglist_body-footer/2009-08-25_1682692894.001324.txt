Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableThanks Martin!I'm worried that might be too complicated: I've got a really basic=20
system in cocoon set up so that researchers on a project can see xml=20
files in HTML and people with various skill sets can make changes where=20
they are comfortable. The whole thing is updated every couple of minutes=20
from a central subversion repository (it is actually all just a clone=20
with some teaks of the DM site, reapplied to an editorial project=20
[thanks James!]).I'd be worried about the time involved in learning a new language and=20
set of protocols at this early stage in the process, where all we are=20
looking for is a way of protecting an otherwise perfectly functioning=20
research site. As my stealing everything from DM suggests, it is at this=20
moment the quickest, least learning intensive solution I'm looking for.But then I've never worked with Python, so maybe I'm being crazy.-danMartin Mueller wrote:
