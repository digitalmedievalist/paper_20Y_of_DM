achines that does something similar, though not the character maths. I'll pos=
t the link later.-----Original Message-----

Subj:  Useful Unicode tool in Mac OS XI just discovered a great and somewhat hidden feature of the OS X
Calculator application: it does Unicode display and "math". That is, you
can display any Unicode character that your system fonts can display by
entering its numeric value, and you can display characters that are plus
or minus any offset you want by doing addition or subtraction. It's a
useful thing to have if you're working with an XML document containing
numeric character entities and you want to know what they represent.To access this, go to "View - Display Format - Unicode" from the menu.
If you had a numeric value in the previous display, it will be replaced
by the equivalent Unicode character. You can display different
characters by hitting the Clear button and then entering a new value.
(The display will update each time you enter a numeral, since the
calculator has no way of knowing whether you're going to enter a
2-digit, 3-digit, 4-digit or whatever value.) You can do Unicode math by
hitting the + or - button and entering a value; the display will update
to the appropriate offset from the character in the display.This works for hexadecimal, too, if you start out with the hex
calculator.David--
