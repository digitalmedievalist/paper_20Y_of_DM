Following the move of the Canterbury Tales Project website to  
Birmingham, we have rebuilt the whole site.  It is now at
http://www.canterburytalesproject.org/index.html
We have taken the opportunity to add far more content to the site.   
Among other things, this now includes:
1.  The full text of all articles in both numbers of the Canterbury  
Tales Project Occasional Papers.  It is almost impossible to buy  
these volumes now so this should be useful to all
2.   Links to working web sample views of two of our major  
publications, the Hengwrt Chaucer Digital Facsimile and the Miller's  
Tale on CD-ROM, and to the whole of the Caxton's Canterbury Tales  
publication
3.  The full text of many articles from our electronic publications,  
and from other publications
4.  Among other things: following recent discussions, readers on this  
list might be interested in the full text of the key transcription  
guidelines, included here in two versions.
All comments welcome!
