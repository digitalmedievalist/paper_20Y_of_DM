This might be a good opportunity for participants at all levels of 
expertise to mention the types of thing they wish they knew (had known) 
in starting or completing various projects.It is important in a community like this that members not feel 
intimidated about raising simple questions or problems as well as 
complex or advanced. Don't be afraid to say what you think for the list 
as a whole!Cheers.
