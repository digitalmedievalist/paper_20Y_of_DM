don't think it would require very much - an agreed-upon Flickr tag
would do it, wouldn't it? Of course this would require that images be
uploaded into Flickr, and there may be some with reservations about
that. But there is something to be said for offloading storage costs
onto someone else (and we would get the additional benefit of being
part of a much larger digital repository, think of the possibilities
for cross-searching and for finding other manuscripts that aren't part
of "our" collection). I do say that as someone who has not used Flickr
very much and perhaps this is obvious. I would love to hear from
others on the list with more experience - how would Flickr work for an
intiative such as this, and would it really be as simple as I think it
would be (the social aspect Fred mentions - that would be, getting
everyone to use the same tag - is a somewhat different matter).I should also say, belatedly, that I'm immensely grateful for the
responses to my query and for the great discussion coming out of those
responses.Thanks,Dot2010/10/28 Neven Jovanović <neven.jovanovic(a)ffzg.hr>:
