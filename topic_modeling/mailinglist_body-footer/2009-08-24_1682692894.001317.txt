Subject: [dm-l] Early Digital Editions
I'm sure this has come up before, but as part of something I'm working
on, I've come across a whole trove of early (i.e. mid-1990s) on-line
editions. In this case often designed as class projects and entirely
non-medieval.This makes me wonder if there is a "hidden corpus" of medieval digital
editions out there--either still available on some murky corner of the
web or lost due to restructuring of URLs at host institutions.I wonder if it would be interesting to collect as big a bibliography of
these as we could. If it turned out that there were hundreds, I'm sure I
could whip together a web-form to allow bibliographic entry. But to
start, what do people know of?-dan--
