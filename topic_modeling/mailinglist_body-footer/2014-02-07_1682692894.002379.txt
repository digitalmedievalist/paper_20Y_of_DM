over the last 125 years for nine pages of the 8th-century St Chad Gospels:
https://lichfield.as.uky.edu. These photographs include up to five images
for a page, beginning with images taken in 1887 and concluding with images
taken by my imaging efforts in 2010. Once you click a page's thumbnail,
the viewer automatically loads a page's full set of images. Choose the
ones you want to compare from the viewer's drop-down lists. You can adjust
the transparency of the top image through the viewer's slidebar.I have also included a brief discussion and some preliminary findings from
overlaying these images: https://lichfield.as.uky.edu/historical-images. I
include an animated gif of an area that contains chipped pigment to
provide one example of the aging (happily, these areas are rare).I continue to think through ways that digital efforts can not only
increase access to medieval manuscripts and digitally preserve them, but
also take advantage of prior photographic and scholarly efforts to enhance
or integrate them with current digital efforts, increasing their value and
what we can know. As always, any comments or suggestions are appreciated.All best,
Bill
