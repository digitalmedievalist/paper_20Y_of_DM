Dear Friends of the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series,On behalf of the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series (METS), a Robbins Library =
Digital Project at the University of Rochester, I am writing to request your =
help in supporting METS's digital redesign efforts by completing the =
following user survey, both linked here<https://tinyurl.com/mets-redesign> an=
d at the bottom of this email. This survey takes approximately 15 minutes to =
complete and is currently set to run until January 9, 2023, at 11:59 pm Easte=
rn Time (UTC-5:00). Your feedback would be greatly appreciated.Over its thirty-two years of publishing, METS has published and provided free=
 online access to hundreds of digital editions of medieval texts, many of whi=
ch would otherwise be rare, prohibitively expensive, or nonexistent as tradit=
ional print editions. These open-access editions have made it possible for in=
structors, students, and researchers alike to teach, learn, and advance schol=
arship on medieval British literature wherever they are in the world. An open=
-access digital collection, however, is only as accessible and useful as its =
website and user interface allow it to be =E2=80=93 and over the past few yea=
rs, it has become clear that both the METS website and its approach to digita=
l editions need an update. Feedback from users like you will be pivotal in re=
imagining both with the needs of our diverse user base in mind.On behalf of METS, thank you for considering this request. We look forward to=
 hearing from you.Best wishes,
