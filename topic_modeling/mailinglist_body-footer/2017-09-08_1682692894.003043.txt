longest-lasting achievements of the Carolingian project. It far out-lasted
the architects of that project, ensuring a long afterlife of their
priorities and influences, even once it was detached from the legacy of a
relatively short-lived political entity, the Carolingian empire. The
Network for the Study of Caroline Minuscule (NSCM) is therefore organising
panels at Leeds IMC 2018 on this phenomenon, welcoming papers on any aspect
of its usage, reception, dissemination, engagement and historiography.
Significant avenues of study have been opened up by recent developments:
the publication of the final volume of Bischoff's *Katalog* and ongoi=
ng
digitisation projects (the Vatican Library, the Polonsky Project at the
British Library and BNF etc.), as well as new resources in the digital
humanities, which our ongoing work on a database of scribal centres will
complement. We would be particularly interested in talks that engage
directly with the aims of that project, perhaps allowing for a recognition
of how local centres working in parallel processed the script from its
origins, or discussing how it developed and evolved in each hub within and
beyond the time-scale of the Carolingian political order. A wide scope is
encouraged, within c. 800-1500, and a broad geographical distribution
across and beyond the boundaries of the Carolingian empire warmly welcome.Potential papers might also engage with:- The influence of discredited historiographical notions of =E2=80=98reform=
' and
=E2=80=98Renaissance', and how engagement with the script's c=
omplexities might
nuance what replaces them.- The practice of scribal memory within manuscripts: palimpsesting,
copying, misinterpreting, glossing and deleting, marginal notation and
signs.- Relationship of Caroline minuscule to other scripts: within a single
manuscript or school, with issues of its authority and hierarchy, or direct
comparison of Caroline minuscule as a phenomenon with antecedents,
descendants and scripts of parallel, lesser or (arguably!) greater
influence.- Use of Caroline minuscule within a broad =E2=80=98type' of manuscri=
pts, say the
liturgical or =E2=80=98priestly handbooks', and how it affects and re=
flects the use
and reading of the contents.- Practices of cataloguing (medieval and modern), digitisation and
terminology.Papers should be 20 minutes, and there will be some time for questions and
discussion. Those interested are encouraged to send:Name/Affiliation/Position
A basic 100 word abstract (there will be time to refine the talks before
the Congress)
A note of any equipment required.to Arthur Westwell and Anna Dorofeeva at carolineminuscule(a)gmail.com by 26
September 2017, which would allow some time to organise before submitting
an application to the Leeds IMC.--===============2723299175325338831==
