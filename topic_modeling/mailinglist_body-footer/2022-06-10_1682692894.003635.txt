SUMAC 2022
The 4th workshop on Structuring and Understanding of Multimedia heritAge Cont=
ents10 or 14 October 2021 (TBA)
Lisbon, Portugal (attendance mode TBA)In conjunction with ACM Multimedia 2022
Workshop: https://sumac-workshops.github.io/2022/
Conference: https://2022.acmmm.orgAims and scope
The digitisation of large quantities of analogue data and the massive product=
ion of born-digital documents for many years now provide us with large volume=
s of varied multimedia data (images, maps, text, video, 3D objects, multi-sen=
sor data, etc.), an important feature of which is that they are cross-domain.=
 =E2=80=9CCross-domain=E2=80=9D reflects the fact that these data may have be=
en acquired in very different conditions: different acquisition systems, time=
s and points of view (e.g. a 1962 postcard from the Arc de Triomphe vs. a rec=
ent street-view acquisition by mobile mapping of the same monument). These da=
ta represent an extremely rich heritage that can be exploited in a wide varie=
ty of fields, from Social Sciences and Humanities to land use and territorial=
 policies, including smart city, urban planning, smart tourism and culture, c=
reative media and entertainment. In terms of research in computer science and=
 artificial intelligence, they address challenging problems related to the di=
versity, specificity and volume of the media, the variety of content descript=
ors (potentially including the time dimension), the veracity of the data, and=
 the different user needs with respect to engaging with this rich material an=
d the extraction of value out of the data. These challenges are reflected in =
various research topics such as multimodal and mixed media search, automatic =
content analysis, multimedia linking and recommendation, and big data analysi=
s and visualisation where scientific bottlenecks may be exacerbated by the ti=
me dimension =E2=80=93 which also provides topics of interest such as multimo=
dal time series analysis. The objective of this workshop is to present and di=
scuss the latest and most significant trends in the analysis, structuring and=
 understanding of multimedia contents dedicated to the valorization of herita=
ge, with the emphasis on enabling access to the big data of the past. We welc=
ome research contributions for the following (but not limited to) topics:  *   Multimedia and cross-domain data search, interlinking and recommendatio=
n=E2=80=A2 Dating and spatialization of historical data
  *   Mixed media data access and indexing
  *   Multi-modal deep learning
  *   Deep learning in adverse conditions (transfer learning, learning with s=
ide information, etc.)
  *   Multi-modal time series analysis, evolution modelling
  *   Multi-modal & multi-temporal data rendering
  *   Heritage - Building Information Modelling, Art Virtualisation
  *   HCI / Interfaces for large-scale datasets
  *   Smart digitisation of massive quantities of data
  *   Bench-marking, Open Data Movement
  *   Generative modelling of cultural heritageKeynote Speakers  *   Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil. Andreas Maier
Talk Theme: "Book CT (Computed Tomography) and Time Machine Projects (https:/=
/www.timemachine.eu/)"
  *   Prof. Georgios Artopoulos
Talk Theme: "Creating a Time Machine of future pasts: data integration and in=
teroperability for cross-disciplinary research on urban heritage clusters."Important dates  *   Paper submission: July 4, 2022 (11:59 p.m. AoE)
  *   Author acceptance notification: July 22, 2022
  *   Camera-Ready: August 7, 2022
  *   Workshop date: TBA, either 10 or 14 October 2022Submission guidelines
Submission format. All submissions must be original work not under review at =
any other workshop, conference, or journal. The workshop will accept papers d=
escribing completed work as well as work in progress. One submission format i=
s accepted: full paper, which must follow
the formatting guidelines of the main conference ACM MM 2022. Full papers sho=
uld be from 6 to 8 pages (plus 2 additional pages for the references), encode=
d as PDF and using the ACM Article Template. For paper guidelines, please vis=
it https://2022.acmmm.org/call-for-papers/, and refer to the "Paper Format" u=
nder "Submission Instructions". Peer Review and publication in ACM Digital Li=
brary. Paper submissions must conform with the =E2=80=9Cdouble-blind=E2=80=9D=
 review policy. All papers will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field, the=
y will receive at least two reviews. Acceptance will be based on relevance to=
 the workshop, scientific novelty, and technical quality. Depending on the nu=
mber, maturity and topics of the accepted submissions, the work will be prese=
nted via oral or poster sessions. The workshop papers will be published in th=
e ACM Digital Library.Organizers
