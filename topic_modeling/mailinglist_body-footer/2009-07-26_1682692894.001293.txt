Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableI've not heard of others doing this, but I use wikis for lots of scratch=20
collaboration projects. So in principle, this is a reasonable way to=20
work informally among a small group on a first pass.My main caveat about this is that this is probably only suitable for a=20
first pass at character capture rather than any serious editorial work,=20
and even then it might prove problematic. The main problem is that there=20
is no way of automatically enforcing a policy on what is to be captured=20
or how these details are to be recorded: if you have multiple people=20
working on a project, and you have no control over what they enter, they=20
will invariably diverge in practice: one scholar might expand=20
abbreviations, another prefer to leave them unexpanded; one might record=20
multiple options for reading difficult passages, another just choose the=20
most likely, and yet others use different symbols for indicating=20
uncertainty. Same is true of damage or codicological features: one=20
scholar might want to record information about the damage down in lines=20
38 or so and ff.; another might just transcribe around the cut and damage.A solution around this might be to insist that encoders use something=20
like the Leiden system of diplomatic transcription symbols although you=20
won't have anyway of enforcing correct use.XML and XML tools like the OxygenXML editor are designed precisely to=20
give you this kind of control. There was a time when they could seem=20
quite intimidating. Nowadays, however, they are becoming ever more user=20
friendly. So one, slightly more formal way, of setting a project up so=20
that more than one person could transcribe texts might be to ask=20
everybody to get a copy of something like OxygenXML (although in=20
principle, it wouldn't matter what editor they used), and then store=20
their common transcriptions online in a version control repository like=20
subversion. People would work on transcriptions on their home computers=20
and then log the files back into the common repository when they were=20
finished. Subversion logs changes and lets more than one person work on=20
the same file at the same time. And you can show the world what you are=20
doing by also publishing the repository (this is how Digital Medievalist=20
works, in fact: we have a subversion repository with all the XML files.=20
This repository is copied to a non-public website (so we can check our=20
work) once every minute or two and then to the public site once a day.=20
Individual editors download files to edit from the central repository).The above assumes that your plan is to have a group of previously=20
identified editors work on the same project (negotiated collaboration).=20
If your goal instead is crowd sourcing (i.e. just putting MS images and=20
or transcriptions up and letting anybody transcribe or edit them, then=20
you'll need some other solution. But planning that depends on what you=20
see the goal of the project as: if it is really just to get the text out=20
of the manuscript photos and into unicode characters, then a wiki might=20
work--but I'd say ask people only to record the letters in front of=20
them, perhaps making a policy of expanding abbreviations, and not to=20
record any paleographic features, uncertainty, etc. Other solutions=20
might depend on what you want to crowd source. For example, if you have=20
an XML encoded document that you are displaying on the web, it could be=20
possible to code the page so that people could click on a word they want=20
to correct, and then get the content of the word (but not the tags)=20
displayed to them in a little form window for correction. And then you=20
could go up to much more heavily programmed solutions.Bottom line: a wiki is a good informal way of sharing work (with loss of=20
policy control) or for crowdsourcing very simple questions (are these=20
the right letters? what letters does this image contain?). But for=20
really encoding expert knowledge or doing anything complicated with the=20
text at all, you are going to want to use XML. There are very robust=20
ways of doing that in a distributed fashion.Buckner wrote:
