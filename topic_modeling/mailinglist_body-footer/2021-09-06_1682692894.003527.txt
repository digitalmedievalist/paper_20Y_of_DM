Leveraging non-named entities in Coptic antiquityStreamed live at https://youtu.be/Web8vaAbx-MIn this paper we present the latest work on large scale, semi-automatic and q=
uantitative analysis of the body of entities mentioned in texts from Coptic A=
ntiquity. Unlike Greek and Roman materials, which have been studied extensive=
ly, digital treatment of Coptic data from the first millennium has lagged beh=
ind until recently, in part due to the smaller research community and the mor=
phological complexity of the language, which is fusional and features aggluti=
nation, compounding and incorporation of nouns into complex verbs.We show how annotating named and non-named entities enriches Coptic corpora, =
including the identification of nested entities and entity linking. We will f=
ocus especially on non-named Coptic entities, which are of great interest to =
scholars working on monasticism and asceticism, since many central texts revo=
lve around unnamed protagonists (e.g. =E2=80=98an ascetic') in uniden=
tified locations (=E2=80=98a monastery'). In many cases, the proporti=
on of named entities is well below 5%.The relevance of entity annotation is further demonstrated through visualizat=
ions of Coptic entities, which enable researchers to access a variety of info=
rmation in Coptic corpora through distant reading, allowing them to explore e=
asily types of places in different works, to get lists of nouns referring to =
organizations, events or animals, examine feminine vs. masculine nouns denoti=
ng people and more. From a comparative quantitative perspective, the prevalen=
ce of non-named entities of different types can also reveal dissimilarities b=
etween texts.ALL WELCOMEDigital Classicist London full programme: https://www.digitalclassicist.org/w=
