e project that is building a transnational and inter-generational data set of=
 life courses generated from the UNESCO recognized convict records of Tasmani=
a. This paper outlines the technical history of the project: mass digitizatio=
n and archiving online of over 100,000 images; manual scholarly transcription=
; TEI standard XML data library based on automated and manual record matching=
 and linkage; crowdsourcing using Google Docs to manage over 60 online volunt=
eer genealogists; re-constitution of amalgamated life courses and record link=
age; development of customized genealogical database for population and famil=
y analysis (Yggrasil); export to statistical programmes (SPSS, Stata). Three =
grants from the Australian Research Council have funded this work, and the ou=
tcomes have been (1) Hamish Maxwell-Stewart's nominal dataset of around 70,00=
0 Tasmanian convicts using Deborah Oxley's transcriptions of the probation er=
a, amplified by full transcriptions of 1 in 25 convicts and linkages to later=
 criminal records (at the University of Tasmania); and (2) the Life Course pr=
oject run by the authors which has completed life courses researched for all =
convicts from 91 convict shiploads, creating a reference population of 12,068=
 men (around 25% of the total) and 5,549 women (around 40% of the total), wit=
h another 6188 (at last count) from random ships (at the University of Melbou=
rne). The proportion of convicts researched for life before, during and after=
 sentence, marriage, fertility and death is around 37% of the total number of=
 convicts for whom adequate records have survived. This sample is big enough =
to enable significant analysis on all-cause and cause-specific mortality; fer=
tility; the life course effects of insult accumulation; temperament and survi=
val; early life influences and intergenerational effects. None of this would =
have been possible without the combination of information technology, digitiz=
ed archives, customized software and the thousands of hours of labour donated=
 by volunteers, to the equivalent value of AUD 4 million!
