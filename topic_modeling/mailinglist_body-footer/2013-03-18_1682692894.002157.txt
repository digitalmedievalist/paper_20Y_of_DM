Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableJust a footnote:Several aspects of scholarly digital editing are being discussed in some=20
articles of the latest issue of Variants (vol. 10, 2013).
Quote from the editor's preface by Wim van Mierlo (p. 9-10):[...] the more general discussions by
Tara L. Andrews and Franz Fischer on digital tools and editorial
rationales available to the digital editor. Andrews' desideratum ---
that digital tools will alter the way we edit --- and Fis[c]her's --- that
digital editions involve much more than putting texts online --- find
their culmination in Peter Robinson's "Towards a Theory of Digital
Editions", which is itself a rejoinder to his own "What is a Critical
Digital Edition" that was published in the inaugural issue of Variants
in 2002.
[...]
The contributions by Andrews and Fischer are based on presentations
at a Roundtable on the topic "Digital or Critical / Digital and
Critical", organized by the Laboratory for Critical Text Editing at the
Lectio center of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, on 21
November 2011. The two essays explore, with reference to Greek
and Latin texts, the apparent contradiction between the advances
in computer technologies and their application to textual editing
and the relative scarcity of truly critical and truly digital scholarly
editions. Andrews addresses the issue head on by saying the scholars
have not yet "articulated a clear idea of what a digital edition would
look like" and that a lot of textual work on classical texts remains
"fundamentally non-digital". Like Andrews, Fischer argues that a
change in mentality is needed, particularly in terms of acknowledging
what makes an edition "truly critical". The default option in the
digital world still often seems to create archives, but "the plurality
of equally legitimate texts" does not obviate the establishment of a
critical text.[end of quote]--
