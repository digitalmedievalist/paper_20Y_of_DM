Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThis last release in the Junicode 0.6 series contains all MUFI (Medieval 
Unicode Font Initiative) alphabetic characters (some diacritics, 
suspensions and other symbols will be added in 0.7). It also adds 
OpenType features especially to support MUFI: enlarged minuscules, 
overlines with roman numbers, underdotted (deleted) text, and an 
alternative shape of yogh can all be produced via Style Sets. Support 
for diacritics via ccmp, mark and mkmk has been expanded, and support 
for MUFI ligatures via hlig (Historical Ligatures) has also been 
expanded. See the documentation for recommendations concerning MUFI 
characters.Junicode is available at http://junicode.sourceforge.net.Peter Baker--===============2151494690156172716==--
