Valentina AsciuttiAbstract:The Collaborative EuropeaN Digital Archive Infrastructure (CENDARI) provides =
and facilitates access to existing archives and resources in Europe for the s=
tudy of medieval and modern European history (specifically the First World Wa=
r period) through the development of an =E2=80=98enquiry environment'=
. As part of this project, the Centre for e-Research is currently hosting two=
 visiting researchers: Kate Macdonald and Alessandro Salvador, who are invest=
igating how CENDARI can assist their own research work. At tonight's seminar =
Kate Macdonald and Alessandro Salvador will discuss their ongoing research, w=
ithin the context of CENDARI.Kate Macdonald's presentation will outline a methodology and early fi=
ndings from reading British popular fiction magazines published for the entir=
ety of the First World War, looking for depictions of the war-wounded ex-sold=
ier, and the civilian who had been impaired by disease, congenital causes, or=
 industrial injury. This stream of cultural production at this time has never=
 been investigated before, yet it presents important evidence for how the ord=
inary reader regarded, or was expected to regard, physical impairment at a ti=
me when the demographics of the physically impaired were changing dramaticall=
y, and new technologies were changing treatments, rehabilitation, and living =
with impairment. This is part of a wider project investigating such depiction=
s during and after WW1 and up to 1939, exploring the hypothesis that some kin=
ds of disability were more deserving than others. She will discuss her role i=
n the CENDARI project as a case study and guinea-pig for exploring humanities=
 research processes.Alessandro Salvador: My contribution will focus on the main topic of my resea=
rch and the reasons and goals of my current work within the CENDARI project. =
I am currently in the final stage of a research about demobilization and rein=
statement into civilian life of the Italian-speaking soldiers enlisted in the=
 Austro-Hungarian army during World War I. In particular, I researched the ac=
tivities of the Italian government in managing a group of Italian-nationals b=
elonging to an enemy State within a complex series of events that started in =
1915 and finished in 1921. This topic represented a challenge for archival re=
search, as the sources are spread throughout archives in Italy, Russia, Austr=
ia and UK. This brought to the idea of creating an online research guide in w=
hich archival information can be gathered and made public for researchers nee=
ding to access sources on this topic. Thus, my current work mostly deals, as =
pilot project, with Italian sources. My contribution will give a brief introd=
uction to the topic and the problematic issues in order to explain the kind o=
f data I am collecting, the way of organizing them and what advantages I expe=
ct that this project will offer to researchers.Bios:Kate Macdonald teaches British literary history and poetry at Ghent Universit=
y, and is the author of several books, chapters and articles on British publi=
shing culture from 1880 to 1950.Alessandro Salvador studied contemporary history in Trieste and Trento, obtai=
ning his Ph.D. in 2010. After a period as exchange scholar (DAAD Program) at =
the Freie Universitaet Berlin, he obtained a post-doc position at the Univers=
ity of Trento. Currently he is part of a research group on WWI involving the =
University and the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento.--===============8792270007533387529==
