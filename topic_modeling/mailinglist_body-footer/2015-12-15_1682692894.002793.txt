we are gathering data about digital humanists, their environment, and their
work.We have designed a very brief survey (it should take less than five minutes
to complete) and would like your help with it. If you can spare a few
minutes to fill up the answers, this will contribute to our understanding
of the field and of the people who work within it.The survey can be found here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DHatWorkThank you for your support,Barbara Bordalejo
Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities
