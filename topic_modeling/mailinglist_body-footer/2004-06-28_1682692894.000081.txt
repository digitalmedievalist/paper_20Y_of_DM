designing instead to standards) is really an argument against 
browser-specific design that is or amounts to a hack. i would include 
using IE-specific functionality or ignoring standards to make something 
work for IE in the latter category. the problem is that IE is the 
dominant browser, so you have to make decisions about what's more 
important in the long run.the thing is that with mozilla and opera you at least have browsers 
that are committed to implementing the standards eventually, even if 
they don't do so (or do so very well), yet. microsoft is another kettle 
of fish.anyhow, i don't want to continue to push this, since i think there's 
probably very little practical disagreement. i do think it's the kind 
of thing that we all need to keep in mind as we make design decisions 
now that we we will have to live with (or fix) down the road. that's 
really what it amounts to.cheers,j--===============5498201161552223204==--
