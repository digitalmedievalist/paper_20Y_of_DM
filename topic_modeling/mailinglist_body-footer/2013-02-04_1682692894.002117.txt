libraries is becoming easier.  For example the Bodleian hired a new
Associate Director for Digital Library Programmes and Information
Technologies in 2012 who is very much in favour of and pushing an open
access / open licensing policy wherever possible, but it will take years
for that to have a real effect (changing old resources, making new
resources available).  http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/ has a growing
collection of resources but most of them are still under old licenses, some
have CC like licenses but only for 'private use'.But a couple years ago we were able to convince them to license all the
images for our William Godwin's Diary project as Creative Commons
Attribution Non-Commercial.
See for example http://godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/folio/e.203_0025v where
although there is a (google maps based) pan/zoom image viewer there is a
link to the full image so that it can be used. (The TEI XML for the
transcription is also available.) This page randomly chosen just happens to
have Mary Shelley's birth recorded on it.  (Sorry... wrong time period).Wearing a @godwindiary tshirt,
James
