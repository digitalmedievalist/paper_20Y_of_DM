the switch between pages (or whatever).  So if going from folio 21
recto to folio 21v I would use=20
<milestone unit=3D"folio" n=3D"21v" />
because the notes to the element states "For this element, the global n
attribute indicates the new number or other value for the unit which
changes at this milestone." (http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/ref-MILEST.html)
And <pb />'s notes state "On this element, the global n attribute
indicates the number or other value associated with the page which
follows the point of insertion of this <pb>."
(http://www.tei-c.org/P4X/ref-PAGEBR.html)I always also use <milestone /> instead of <pb /> to refer to folio=20
count and <pb /> to refer to record inscribed page numbers that may=20
not be consistent, numerical or in any way sequential.  (I transcribed=20
entries from some churchwardens' accounts where the folios had two=20

the guidelines.-James
