objective the development of a computer program to provide chronological 
context for undated English private charters issued after the Norman 
Conquest in 1066 and before the reign of Edward II in 1307. During this 
period, approximately 95% of these documents were promulgated without 
dates. Only after the start of the 14^th century was internal dating 
regularly applied to conveyances. The program which has been developed, 
and is now available on line, produces a date based on the comparison of 
word-strings in the test document with similar word-strings in a 
database of 10,000 dated charters. We would like to invite you to test this program using Latin texts from 
the period. You will find the site at:http://scriptor.deeds.utoronto.ca:7777/d_mechOnce at the home page, click on "Go" at the bottom centre. Paste your 
document to be dated in the empty rectangle and click on "next". If you 
wish, edit your text. This entails exchanging personal or place name 
with the letter "P" (& note also what appears under "DOCUM" on the home 
page). Continue to click "next" and finally "Date it".  The result will 
appear in Roman numerals in the upper left of your screen, and in Arabic 
numerals at the lower right. Generally speaking, these machine-generated dates provide accuracy 
within Â± 10 years about 65% of the time. To bring the remaining 35% in 
line, we will need to develop additional algorithms.
The statistical background for the program was developed by Professor 
Andrey Feuerverger of the Department of Statistics, and his PhD student, 
Gelila Tilahun. The dating program, and the website, were created by 
Rodolfo Fiallos of the DEEDS Project. Based on tests using the dated documents in the DEEDS corpus, the 
program can provide reasonable accuracy from about 1160; before that 
time there are very few dated documents available to serve as 
comparative material. We are always looking for documents to add to the 
database, especially for the period 1066 to 1200, and would welcome 
examples from sources other than those we have already searched (about
190 printed sources up to this point). In fact, our efforts would 
benefit greatly from the collaboration of interested colleagues, both in 
providing us with the texts of transcribed documents on the one hand, 
and in testing the dating program with them on the other.We also have a search engine which provides access to the content of the 
10,000 documents in the manner of a concordance. By this means, the 
database is fully searchable, and each column can be arranged in 
alphabetical or numeric order by clicking at the top of the column:http://res.deeds.utoronto.ca:49838/research/Click on Medieval Latin Charters > SearchPlace a word or word-string into the "Query" box. Click on the bullet 
"Context". Enter the no. of words you would like to find at either end 
of your chosen string. Click on "Execute". This is a beta program. We have worked long and hard to develop it, 
while at the same time knowing that there is always room for greater 
accuracy and improvement. We hope you will find it useful and that you 
will send us your reactions. Michael Gerversm.gervers(a)utoronto.ca <mailto:m.gervers(a)utoronto.ca> Rodolfo Fiallosr.fiallos(a)utoronto.ca <mailto:r.fiallos(a)utoronto.ca> Toronto,8 June 2008--
