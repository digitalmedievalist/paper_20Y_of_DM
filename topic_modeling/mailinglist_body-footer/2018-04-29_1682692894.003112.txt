Funded PhD Scholarship*Project Title: *A study and critical edition of the Carolingian
compilation *De Astronomia *in Laon, Bibliothéque Municipale, MS 422*Supervisor*:  Dr Jacopo Bisagni (Classics / School of Languages,
Literatures and Cultures / CASSCS / NUI, Galway)*Duration:* Funded for 4 years (Structured PhD), full-time.*Project description: *This Structured PhD project is a component of the
larger project =E2=80=98Ireland and Carolingian Brittany: Texts and Transmiss=
ion'
(IrCaBriTT), funded by the Laureate Scheme of the Irish Research Council
(IRC) and led by Dr Jacopo Bisagni.The successful applicant will transcribe, edit and analyse the Carolingian
astronomical/computistical compilation titled *De Astronomia*, contained in
the early 9th-century manuscript Laon, Bibliothéque Municipale, 422
(hereafter abbreviated as L).In particular, thorough source-criticism of L will be aimed at identifying
all the sources that underlie this impressive scientific encyclopaedia and
the textual strata that compose it. Central to this work will be the
attempt to understand the exact relationship between L and other Early
Medieval manuscripts that share textual materials with it (especially
Cologne, Dombibliothek, MS 83-II): this detailed analysis will focus on (A)
the possible role played by Brittany in the creation of some of the textual
strata that constitute the compilation *De Astronomia*, and (B) the exact
route of transmission followed by the materials of Irish origin found
therein.The PhD student will moreover study the language of L, in order to
retrieve, for example, syntactic and/or lexical peculiarities that may be
attributable to specific forms of regional Latinity (e.g. Breton, Irish
etc.).It is expected that the PhD thesis =E2=80=93 which will constitute this proje=
ct's
main deliverable =E2=80=93 will contain: (1) a comprehensive study of the con=
tents,
underlying sources and overall significance of L; (2) a critical edition of *=
De
Astronomia*, accompanied by an English translation, a philological
*apparatus*, and further *apparati *indicating sources and wider parallels;
(3) a detailed textual commentary.*Stipend:*  =E2=82=AC16,000 per annum; fees for 4 years: =E2=82=AC23,000 (=E2=
=82=AC5,750 x 4).
