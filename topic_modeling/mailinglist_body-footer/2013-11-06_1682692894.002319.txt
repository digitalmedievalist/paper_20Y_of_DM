Abstract: To what extent can we organise and engineer knowledge construction =
using space and visualisation? Using physical or virtual architectural struct=
ures and landscapes for cognitive enhancement has been practised for centurie=
s. The Art of Memory or Ars Memoriae is one of the techniques that is used to=
 assist in the combination and 'invention' of new ideas. This is achieved by =
associating emotionally striking memory images within visualized locations. T=
he widespread use of video games and mobile devices is expanding the practise=
 of spatial cognition in both virtual and physical environments respectively.=
 By gathering evidence from these practises this research aims to answer the =
following questions: In today's context of technological and visual culture h=
ow do we use this potential of spatial cognition to manage, structure and org=
anise the increasing amount of information that we acquire? Can we overcome o=
ur apparent cognitive limits by combining these ancient pedagogies with moder=
n technologies? To what extent can we use analogue and digital technology to =
combine concrete reasoning with abstract reasoning in order to form new ways =
of learning?Bios: Carl Smith is Director of the Learning Technology Research Institute (L=
TRI) at London Metropolitan University. He is an academic expert, researcher =
and developer with a long-standing focus on pervasive learning technologies, =
hybrid reality and digital/mobile learning. His background is in Computer Sci=
ence and Architecture. He specialises in using various visualization techniqu=
es to produce augmented spaces for the generation and transformation of learn=
ing. His other research interests include visual and spatial literacy, patter=
n recognition, intermediality, visualisation as interface, and open source le=
arning. The LTRI conducts research into the application of information and co=
mmunication technologies to augment, support and transform learning.Pierre-Francois Gerard is currently a PhD Student in Computing Department at =
Goldsmith College, University of London. His main research area is the use of=
 space to enhance learning. His background is in Architecture (Graduated in B=
russels) and 3D visualisation. During 10 years of professional practice with =
architects and designers both in Brussels and London, Pierre-Fran?ois realize=
d the potential of 3D visualisation techniques as a creative force not only i=
n the design process but mainly as a communication tool. He graduated in Info=
rmation and Communication Technology (MA France). Through this very interdisc=
iplinary lens, his research interests include spatial cognition, long-term me=
mory, 3D learning environments, human computer interaction and game design.--===============4775714190658526701==
