Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitChristian Wittern, who has served so ably as TEI Council Chair since
2003, will be stepping down at the end of his third term on December
31st, 2007.To assist it in its deliberations, the TEI Board is seeking nominations
(including self-nominations) for candidates to replace Professor Wittern
in this important post. Nominees need not be members of the TEI, its
Board, or Council. The successful candidate will be appointed to both
the Board and Council for an initial term of two years. As an officer of
the Consortium, the Council Chair is not remunerated. The Council is
assigned a significant budget for travel and other costs including
technical support and editorial assistance, however.The Council Chair is responsible for directing the activities of the
Council and its workgroups. This involves maintaining and developing the
Guidelines and proposing and assisting in the development of training
documents and tutorials, technical services, and collaborations between
the TEI and other organisations. In keeping with the emphasis of the
2007 Members' Meeting, the board is particularly interested in
candidates who share the Board's interest in improving the Consortium's
work on outreach, education, and collaboration.The Board intends to appoint a replacement for Professor Wittern within
the next six weeks. Nominations should be directed to the Executive
Secretary, Chris Ruotolo (ruotolo(a)virginia.edu), no later than 1200 UTC
on January 11, 2008.For further information, please feel free to contact the Consortium
Chair, Daniel Paul O'Donnell (daniel.odonnell(a)uleth.ca) or any member of
the Consortium Board (see http://www.tei-c.org/About/board.xml for a
list with contact addresses).--
