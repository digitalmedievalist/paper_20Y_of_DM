Hello Peter (if I may),I'd like to second Lisa Fagin Davis's thanks for your work on=
 these fonts. #MedievalTwitter is, indeed, losing its collective mind over Jo=
scelyn and not *just* because folks are in various versions of isolation. I t=
oo am rhapsodizing about ligatures. There are already many uses for these fon=
ts; there will be more. I'm not telling you anything you don'=
t know. But I would just like to add my Huzzah to those of others!Cheers,

I've decided to do this all at once rather than annoying people by posting ab=
out them one by one. The story overall is that I have a number of font projec=
ts, some going back nearly thirty years, and I have decided to make public re=
positories for any that are in a usable state. Why? Because I am a senior cit=
izen, and life seems uncertain right now. I want them out in public, with sou=
rce code, so that people can download and enjoy them, fork them if they want,=
 and develop them farther. A couple of these have been out in the wild for so=
me time, but the repository is where you will find the latest version.I haven't made releases for these, but each repository has a "font" folder. T=
o get the font, click on that folder, then click on the name of the file, the=
n find and click the "Download" button.Here are the fonts:BeowulfOTThis is an update of my Beowulf1 font, which has been out and about just abou=
t forever, and which you see in lots of places from websites to book covers t=
o TV titles. This version, never before released, has a modern mode (legible =
to modern readers) and a historical mode (for teachers and purists). Unlike t=
he original version, it has ligatures and a number of other OpenType features.https://github.com/psb1558/BeowulfOT-fontEaduiA reproduction of the English Caroline minuscule hand of the great eleventh-c=
entury Canterbury scribe Eadui Basan. It has modern and historical modes and =
numerous contextual alternates and other cool features. It has been available=
 on various websites for years, though it is not as well known as Beowulf1.https://github.com/psb1558/Eadui-FontCissanthemosBased on the ninth-century Royal Bible, BL MS Royal 1 E. VI, a splendid examp=
le of insular hybrid minuscule. It contains caps in three different styles, o=
ne of which has long been available as the font "Anglo-Saxon Caps" (from 1993=
!), which you see everywhere. Cissanthemos has modern and historical modes an=
d a very large number of contextual alternates, giving it an irregular, hand-=
made look.https://github.com/psb1558/Cissanthemos-fontParkerChronicleBased on the first hand of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 173, "The Pa=
rker Chronicle." The font is named after the book because I haven't yet thoug=
ht up a better name for it. With modern and historical modes and plenty of Op=
enType goodies. This has been seen in public precisely once, when I gave a co=
py to the proprietor of Blue Mountain Brewery to use on the label of "Adambeo=
r," an Old English-themed craft beer that you can sample if you ever find you=
rself, post-pandemic, driving through Afton, Virginia. (He paid me for my hel=
p and the font with two cases of his really excellent beer.)https://github.com/psb1558/ParkerChronicle-fontJoscelynThe secretary hand font, mentioned here a few days ago.https://github.com/psb1558/Joscelyn-fontElstobA modern variable font mainly for web use. If you don't know what a variable =
font is, visit https://psb1558.github.io/Elstob-font/ and play around. There =
are lots of OpenType features, outlined in an accompanying document, and thes=
e are also available in a desktop version, ElstobD. This has been submitted t=
o Google Fonts, but they're so backed up, I don't know when they'll get to it=
, if ever.Repository: https://github.com/psb1558/Elstob-font
Releases: https://github.com/psb1558/Elstob-font/releasesFinally there's Junicode-new (https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-New), a lon=
g-term project to expand, modernize and improve my rather long-in-the-tooth J=
unicode font, but there are no usable fonts in that repository yet.May we all dodge the virus and come through the next few harrowing months san=
e and in good health!PeterPeter S. Baker
