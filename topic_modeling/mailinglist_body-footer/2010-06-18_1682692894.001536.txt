emu Roos and Petri Myllymäk of the University of Helsinki), I have prepa=
red a page giving access to five full sets of data prepared for phylogenetic =
analysis: four for sections of the Canterbury Tales, one for the Old Norse So=
larljod.  These datasets have been produced with exceptional care, to give th=
e most accurate and complete portrayal of the variation in each tradition. Fo=
r each dataset, we also present an expert scholarly analysis.Our hope, in releasing this data, is to encourage researchers interested in t=
he possibilities and challenges of the application of phylogenetic methods to=
 stemmatics to experiment with different methods of analysis on 'real' datase=
ts.  We would be glad to hear of any and all uses made of this data.The data is at http://www.textualscholarship.org/newstemmatics/data/index.htm=
