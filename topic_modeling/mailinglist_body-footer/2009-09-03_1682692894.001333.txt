pleasure. Definitely more convenient than the hardcopy form, and, of 
course, more up to date.2. Google Books. It has been a great way to get things like old EETS 
editions that I'm too lazy to take out of the library, or to chase down 
obscure footnotes in obscure publications that I don't want to trouble 
the interlibrary loans people about.3. The Auchinleck MS online. Mostly for teaching; a lovely resource. The 
availability of good-quality MS facsimiles online has made a huge 
difference to my teaching, especially when I am located in the Canadian 
West, where medieval MSS are sparse. Hats off to the NLS for its 
generosity in sharing this important MS with the rest of us, and to 
Alison Wiggins and the late David Burnley for a beautiful edition.Yin Liu> So, out of scholarly curiosity, what is your favorite
