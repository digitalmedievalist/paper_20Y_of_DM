I'm not sure the question is simply one of prestige, although it is that 
too. The main problem, as I see it, with on-line publications is not 
that they are free, but that they are too easy to publish. The advantage 
of the presses is the gatekeeper effect: the work has been vetted to a 
certain degree, and, perhaps even more importantly, somebody has 
hopefully demanded that typos are fixed, that there is bibliographic 
consistency, up-to-date referencing, etc. (I realise that a) this is not 
always true and there are some real stinkers from prestigious presses, 
b) that this can smother innovation, and c) that there are very high 
quality on-line publications; it is, however, mostly true, I think).My own belief is that the key to successful, prestigious but useful and 
free/low cost publication is improved refereeing on-line. We need 
gatekeeper sites that allow authors access to prestige in exchange for 
their agreement to maintain the kind of standards found, if not always 
consistently, in the scholarly print world. Certainly as we have been 
putting together the plans for the Digital Medievalist (on-line) 
journal, this has been foremost in our minds. We have been trying to 
capture the best of both worlds by constructing an entity that has room 
for the greater currency found on-line (we will be welcoming project 
reports and commentary/polemical pieces) and the (in reputation at 
least) farther reach and great care found in refereed print publications.The problem with gatekeepers is that they need to be maintained (and 
hence cost money), and can become overly clique-y and conservative. I'm 
not unique in suggesting that ultimately the way forward is to turn to 
the scholarly societies and communities for maintenance, since academics 
tend to be willing to donate time to such projects, and universities are 
often willing to host permanent server sites (something the University 
of Lethbridge is doing for us). The cliqueishness and conservativeness 
of the gatekeeper is something that can only be address by members of 
the community when they are asked to referee. I am sometimes appalled at 
how destructive and poor quality humanities refereeing is (though I also 
know of good examples). Having grown up in a scientist's family, I know 
that, while far from perfect, it can be much more constructive in other 
disciplines--although it is also true that Physics Letters (I think it 
is) ultimately had to issue ground rules to referees noting that they 
would not accept mean-spirited and non-constructive readers reports. I 
was talking about this last problem with a number of Canadian social 
scientists and humanists at a recent SSHRC (Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council [of Canada]) meeting. We're debating whether 
we shouldn't start looking for or working on a general advice sheet for 
constructive refereeing.I suppose the last paragraph is off topic for this list, though it is 
something we've been discussing for the journal.
