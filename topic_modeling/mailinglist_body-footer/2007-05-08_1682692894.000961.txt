Deadline: August 1, 2008The annual TEI Members' Meeting takes place every year in October or
November. We are now seeking bids to host this event in 2008.The meeting this year (2007) will take place on October 31-November 3 at
the University of Maryland in College Park, MD (USA). The previous
meetings have been:      * Victoria, Canada, October 27-28, 2006. Hosted by the University
        of Victoria. 
      * Sophia, Bulgaria, October 28-29, 2005. Hosted by the Bulgarian
        Academy of Sciences. 
      * Baltimore, USA, October 22-23, 2004. Hosted by Johns Hopkins
        University. 
      * Nancy, France, November 7-8 2003. Hosted by ATILF. 
      * Chicago, USA, October 11-12 2002. Hosted by the Newberry Library
        and  
      * Northwestern University. 
      * Pisa, Italy, November 16-17 2001. Hosted by the University of
        Pisa.The site of the meeting has typically alternated between Europe and
North America, but that is not a fixed rule. We welcome proposals from
other parts of the world, and in particular from areas where new TEI
communities are arising.This year's meeting will be a three-day event, with approximately 70-100
attendees. The first and second day will involve plenary lectures by
invited speakers, round-table discussions, and conference-style session.
The third day will be a closed session, restricted to TEI members and
subscribers only, which includes reports on the TEI's work and the
annual elections for the TEI Board and Council. Meetings of TEI Special
Interest Groups (SIGs) are also scheduled for this day. Future meetings
should assume roughly this shape, although there is considerable room
for local initiative in consultation with the Board.The TEI Consortium covers the direct costs in connection with the 
meeting. As the TEI is an organisation with limited financial resources,
and any contribution from the host is very welcome.Bids should be sent to info(a)tei-c.org by August 1, 2008, and should 
include the following information:
      * The name of the institution(s) making the bid 
      * The name, address, email, and telephone number of the contact
        person 
      * A brief description of the facilities available for the event
        (rooms, equipment, technical support, food) 
      * An indication of what financial support, if any, the hosting
        institution is prepared to give (for instance, sponsoring one or
        more receptions or pre-meeting workshops; payment of travel
        expenses for one or more plenary speakers; etc.) 
      * Any other details that may be useful in assessing the bid (e.g.
        the presence of a conference on a related topic at the
        institution around the time of the meeting; the launch of a new
        TEI-related initiative at the institution, etc.).All bids will be reviewed by the TEI board, which makes the final
decision.Thank you very much!Daniel O'Donnell--
