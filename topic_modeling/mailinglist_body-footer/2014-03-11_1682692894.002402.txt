Mellon Junior Faculty Fellow in Digital HistoryWashington and Lee University invites applications for a Mellon Foundation
postdoctoral fellowship for recent Ph.D.s in history who intend to pursue
careers as teacher-scholars in a liberal arts college setting. These
two-year fellowships are open to candidates who earned their Ph.D.s in
Spring 2012 or later. Fellows will play an active role in helping to
demonstrate innovative methods of teaching, making interdisciplinary
connections and teaching new courses in neglected areas of the curriculum.
Fellows will have a reduced teaching load to allow time for their own
scholarly development.The Department of History seeks a specialist in digital history with a
concentration in ancient or any field in pre-1800 global or non-Western
history. Applicants should have experience with digital humanities
pedagogies and using digital humanities tools in their scholarly research.Apply electronically at our portal: https://jobs.wlu.edu/postings/1907.
After filling out a cover sheet, you will be prompted to upload a letter of
application, a CV, a sample of recent scholarly work, and enter contact
information for two providers of letters of recommendation (or a
credentials file). Review of applications will begin April 7, 2014. Address
your application letter (and any questions) to Professor Sarah Horowitz (
horowitzs(a)wlu.edu), Chair, Mellon Junior Faculty Fellow in Digital History
Search Committee, Department of History, Washington and Lee University,
Lexington, VA 24450. Washington and Lee and the Department of History are
interested in candidates committed to high standards of scholarship and
professional activities, and to the development of a campus climate that
supports equality and diversity among its faculty, staff, and students. The
University is an Equal Opportunity Employer.--
