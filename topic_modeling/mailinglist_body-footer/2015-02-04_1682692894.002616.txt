Having found out that one option to distinguish genuin documents from  
forgeries in that period is the correct use of the so-called "cursus",  
I must, of course, check if in "my" documents the cursus was used  
correctly or not. But I'm wondering if I should do that manually.  
Maybe there are better ways.So, are there ready-to-use solutions for detecting the use of the  
cursus in latin texts?The "cursus" is basically a kind of prose rhythm based on the word  
stress. A set of rules determines the distribuation of stressed and  
unstressed syllables within a sentence. Thus, a tool (semi)  
automatically detecting the stress of latin words would be great thing  
to start with.Any ideas or suggestions are welcome!Best regards,
Christian
