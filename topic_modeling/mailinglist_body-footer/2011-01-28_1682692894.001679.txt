Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitDear Digital Medievalists,I guess I can safely assume that several people here have an experience 
teaching the TEI, specifically to an audience of medievalists or 
historians. After teaching some workshops, I feel more and more that it 
is highly efficient to teach the TEI not alone, isolated, as a means to 
encode documents in a smart way, but putting the TEI XML at the center 
of the other technologies that make its interest immediately evident to 
the students.
For instance, I have experienced that providing the students, when 
they're finished with their task of encoding a critical edition, with 
the Version Machine on the one hand and another set of XSLT producing a 
classic, print-like view of their document greatly helps them 
understanding not only what encoding is for, but also what they have 
been doing so far.  I am even pondering whether or not including the use 
of eXist-db in a forthcoming course (which might be pushing it a bit 
far, I admit).
Of course, since XSLT or XQuery are not really easy to grasp in a short 
period for people without any technical background, and it is not really 
evident to introduce them to the subtleties of those technologies. 
Still, it's probably good if the students get some idea of how 
technologies work together, instead of putting all their trust into the 
magic IT people will work on their smartly encoded TEI documents to "put 
them on the web" :)I would be interested in a feedback of your practice: do you, when you 
teach the TEI, feel the need / manage to integrate notions about other 
tools and technologies of the XML family? And if so, how do you do that 
(proper introduction to XSLT? use of packaged tools like the v-machine? 
etc.).Just curious :)Marjorie--
