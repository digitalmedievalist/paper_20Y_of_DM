We don't need to "envisage a time when early markup projects become the
subject of scholarly investigation", there are those who study just
this.  The OTA has been collecting electronic texts for nearly 30
years... very few of them are actually in XML.  The study of earlier=20
markup forms (like say COCOA) is undertaken by those looking at the=20
history of humanities computing.  I gave a paper at the ALLC-ACH this=20
year looking at the problems the OTA might have in migrating copies=20
of its resources to XML. (A big undertaking...)  A lot of the pilot=20
study for this involved the identification and scoping of what form=20
of markup those resources listed as "unknown markup" really were in.All of this goes to a point (believe it or not), that the documenation=20
of your chosen encoding scheme and why you've put $ before all the=20
adjectives (or whatnot) is one of the most important aspects for=20
its preservation.-James---
