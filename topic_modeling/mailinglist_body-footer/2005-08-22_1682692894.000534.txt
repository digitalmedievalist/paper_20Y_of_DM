understand technology in general.  I remember in my undergraduate years
that humanities computing was just something that the 'techies' in the
department knew.  There wasn't a formal course, except an advanced
rhetoric and communication course, which I am grateful I took.  However,
my department (department of English at Washington State University) just
received new MACs so they wanted to show them off.Anyway, now that I am at the University of Manchester I see that there is
an enormous gap that needs to be filled.  Some of the students here cannot
even copy a file correctly or do simple tasks in Word.  We do have some
courses that enable some students to understand some basic concepts, but
if you ask them what HTML is or how to write a web page there will be
question marks written all over their faces.Therefore, we need to differentiate what we mean by humanities computing
for those in the US and Canada, and those the UK; believe me, it's like
night and day.  In graduate programmes in the UK there needs to be more
emphasis on 'required', rather than 'optional', courses on general
computer usage, before they move on to other, more advanced skills and
technologies.The emphasis in most humanities faculties in the UK seems to be focused on
interdisciplinary work.  For us, that means working in history, English,
archaeology, etc.  However, I do not see in the near future faculties
spending too much money on requiring students to become more computer
literate - they will leave it to the students to find a way.  On the other
hand, I am glad to see that institutions in the US and Canada are at least
opening the eyes of faculties and students to a necessary field.Sorry for all the babble!Abdullah Alger
