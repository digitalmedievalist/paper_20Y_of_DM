19-2020 Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies (SIMS) Visiting Research =
Fellowship program. Guided by the vision of its founders, Lawrence J. Schoenb=
erg and Barbara Brizdle Schoenberg, SIMS aims to bring manuscript culture, mo=
dern technology, and people together to provide access to and understanding o=
f our shared intellectual heritage. Part of the Penn Libraries, SIMS oversees=
 an extensive collection of premodern manuscripts from around the world (http=
s://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren), with a special focus on the history of=
 philosophy and science, and creates open-access digital content to support t=
he study of its collections. SIMS also hosts the Schoenberg Database of Manus=
cripts (https://sdbm.library.upenn.edu/) and the annual Schoenberg Symposium =
on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age (http://www.library.upenn.edu/about/=
exhibits-events/ljs-symposium).
The SIMS Visiting Research Fellowships have been established to encourage res=
earch relating to the premodern manuscript collections at the University of P=
ennsylvania Libraries, including the Schoenberg Collection. Affiliated with t=
he University of Pennsylvania, located near other manuscript-rich research co=
llections (the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropol=
ogy, the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Science History Institute, and the=
 Rosenbach Museum and Library, among many others), and linked to the local an=
d international scholarly communities, SIMS offers fellows a network of resou=
rces and opportunities for collaboration. Fellows will be encouraged to inter=
act with SIMS staff, Penn faculty, and other medieval and early modern schola=
rs in the Philadelphia area. Fellows will also be expected to present their r=
esearch at Penn Libraries either during the term of the fellowship or on a se=
lected date following the completion of the term.
Applicants can apply to spend 1 month (minimum of 4 work weeks) at SIMS betwe=
en July 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020. To be considered, applications are due Ma=
y 15, 2019. For more information and to apply, please visit: https://schoenbe=
