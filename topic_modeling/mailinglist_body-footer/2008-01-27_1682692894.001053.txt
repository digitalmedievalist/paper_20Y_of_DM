who would also be interested in the following mailing, which we
therefore forward with the usual apologies for any duplicated
postings]Dear colleague,This email is being sent to you because we think you are or were
interested in using the MASTER dtd for marking up manuscript
descriptions.It's over ten years since Peter Robinson first organized a meeting at
Studley Priory to discuss the possibility of developing an
international standard for manuscript description. The work done by
the MASTER project which followed that meeting established a
preliminary and highly influential candidate for such a standard. In
the last  decade, the MASTER DTD or versions of it have been adopted
by dozens of different manuscript cataloguing projects worldwide and
the most recent version of the Text Encoding Initiatives P5 Guidelines
is based  upon it.The Manuscriptorium Project at the National Library of the Czech
Republic (http://www.manuscriptorium.com/) is one of the largest
European cataloguing projects based on the MASTER DTD.  We are now
working on defining a new TEI P5 conformant schema for this system and
also in developing conversion tools for existing records collections
to be migrated to the new schema. This work is being done as part of
the ENRICH (European Networking Resources and Information concerning
Cultural Heritage) project, funded by the EU eContentPlus programme.Part of the workplan involves a review of other MASTER-based systems,
in an attempt to learn from their experiences, good or bad, in
different contexts. We have set up a short online questionnaire for
this purpose at http://tinyurl.com/yutq2r -- if you have ever used
MASTER in some   form, or simply considered using it, we very much
hope you will be able to spare a little time to complete the
questionnaire. It should  not take you more than 10 minutes.We will be holding a special one day workshop to discuss the outcome
of this survey at the University of Copenhagen at the end of February:
if you would like to attend this meeting, please let us know. Please
also feel free to pass this enquiry on to others you know of who might
be interested.With best wishes, and thanks in advance for your inputLou Burnard (Oxford University)
