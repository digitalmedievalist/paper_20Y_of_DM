wrap an XML root element around the text document and then pipe it 
through an XSLT stylesheet designed to wrap <l>line elements</l> 
around each   text containing line.  Alternatively, fairly easy to do 
with a decent search and replace macro or perl script.> Page numbering: As above, is there a macro or application that can

Sebastian's OO->TEI XML filter which should preserve page numbers. 
The lines will come out as <p> paragraphs </p> but that is a quite 
search and replace.

better are here at the ACH/ALLC conference in Victoria, BC at the 
moment.  And the weather is much too nice to be checking email!
