Digital AgeNovember 6-8, 2014Collecting HistoriesIn partnership with the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of
Philadelphia, the Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies at the
University of Pennsylvania is pleased to announce the 7th Annual Lawrence
J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age. This
year's symposium highlights the work of the Schoenberg Database of
Manuscripts by bringing together scholars and digital humanists whose work
concerns the study of provenance and the history of collecting pre-modern
manuscripts. The life of a manuscript book only just begins when the
scribe lays down his pen. What happens from that moment to the present day
can reveal a wealth of information about readership and reception across
time, about the values of societies, institutions, and individuals who
create, conserve, and disperse manuscript collections for a variety of
reasons, and about the changing role of manuscripts across time, from
simple vehicles of textual transmission to revered objects of collectors'
desires.  The study of provenance is the study of the histories of the
book.For more information and to register online, go to
