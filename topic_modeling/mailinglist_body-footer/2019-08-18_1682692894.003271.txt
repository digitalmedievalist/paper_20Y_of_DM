Betreff: Roundtable "Digital Tools for Historical Research" at IMC in

the =E2=80=9CDissident Networks Project=E2=80=9D (DISSINET, https://dissinet.=
cz/) hosted at
this research centre are pleased to invite proposals for short presentations
(5 min.) of various digital tools for historical research (e.g.: software,
environments for the annotation of texts and digitized manuscripts, the
adaptation of general-purpose digital tools to historical research, etc.)
to be presented at a roundtable session on "Digital Tools for Historical
Research" at the International Medieval Congress 2020 in Leeds, UK (6-9
July 2020).Each speaker should briefly present a tool and be prepared to answer
questions from the audience on its use and application. The speakers may be
connected with the developers of the tool, but this is in no way a
requirement. They need only know it well enough to be able to present it to
the audience and answer questions. Overall, the roundtable and subsequent
discussions are intended to create a space for networking between users and
potential users of such tools (and in some cases their developers).The participants in any session of the congress, including this roundtable,
are expected to register for the congress and pay the registration fee and
their travel costs.Please send brief informal proposals to David Zb=C3=ADral at
david.zbiral(a)mail.muni.cz by September 15th at the latest. Any proposal
should contain the name of the tool or environment to be discussed, a short
description of the tool, information about its availability (licence), and
the address of a website where more information about the tool is available
(if applicable). A formal abstract is not required.We look forward to your proposals!All the best,David.
