Vienna (July 18-20, 2018)Everyone is familiar with Google Maps=E2=80=94all of us are using it on a dai=
ly=20
basis. In 2012 a group of researchers at Stanford (led by Walter=20
Scheidel), developed Orbis (http://orbis.stanford.edu/)[1], which, one=20
may put, applied the same geographical principles to a particular=20
historical context. Dubbed =E2=80=9Ca Google Maps for the Roman Empire=E2=80=
=9D[2], this=20
model became a popular historical online resource and an object of envy=20
for scholars working in other historical contexts.Inspired by Orbis, the Uni-Wien DH Team is organizing a three-day=20
hackathon at the University of Vienna on the theme of map visualisations=20
for historical data. One specific objective of the hackathon will be to=20
build a sort of =E2=80=9COrbis-in-a-Box=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94an open-source platf=
orm that would=20
allow others to model movements of people and objects in different=20
historical and cultural contexts. (For more details on this particular=20
idea, see: http://kgeographer.com/orbis-in-a-box/).We are inviting interested digital humanists with an inclination for=20
coding to partake in this 3-day event in Vienna. We are able to offer=20
small bursaries to offset traveling costs.If you would like to attend, please send a message to=20
maxim.romanov(a)univie.ac.at with =E2=80=9CORBIS-esque Hackathon=E2=80=9D in =
the subject=20
by 30 June 2018, stating your current institutional affiliation (if any)=20
and your motivation for participating in the hackathon. Please also=20
specify whether you are applying for a bursary.Yours truly,
