in terms of having to use IE in my current side-work have been fixed 
with mozilla 1.7. this had to do with NT-server-based login. mozilla 
1.7 has apparently resolved these issues, and i can now log in 
successfully using mozilla and firefox or camino (both of which rely on 
mozilla 1.7), as well as IE. i don't know about the recent safari, 
since i'm still on X 10.2, not panther. my colleague found it 
interesting, as well. just a reminder that some of this is browser and 
some is platform . . .cheers,j--===============3248627568549219475==--
