Jeanette Patterson (Princeton University) In line with one of the editorial mandates of Digital Philology, in this
session, we seek to promote discussion around how manuscript research may be
predicated upon effective cross-disciplinary work. We invite submissions

but also reach across disciplinary boundaries by asking broader
methodological or theoretical questions, including but not limited to: .             the materiality of the codex.             the sociopolitical lives of books.             border crossings: a manuscript that travels across
geographical space, across social milieux or, more abstractly, across
languages, genres, media or other categories.             our digital engagement with medieval books Please send a 100-word abstract and Participant Information Form to Albert
