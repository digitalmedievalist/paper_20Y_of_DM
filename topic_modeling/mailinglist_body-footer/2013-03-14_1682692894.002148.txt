Subject: Re: [dm-l] New article on "Medievalists and the Scholarly Digital Ed=
ition"I really enjoyed this paper as well. I think it's pretty obvious why digital =
editions are not more popular with both authors and readers, some of which ar=
e touched on in the article:
- Compared to a printed book, they're miserable to read, since they tend to b=
e designed first for technical analysis, and any attention to typography is t=
ypically a very low priority. (Granted, this is a problem with most e-books.)
- There's no guarantee in many cases that citations made from digital edition=
s will be stable.
- It's far easier to put a good printed edition together than a good digital =
edition, especially because of the lack of standard, user-friendly tools.
- There is no standard way of presenting online critical editions (whereas mo=
st printed texts are published in series that follow a style guide).
- Delving into academic politics, publishers hate them and many universities =
don't count digital projects toward tenure.None of these problems are insurmountable, and most have been tackled already=
 by someone, but I'm really looking forward to a solution that at least tackl=
es the technical aspects of these problems.Andrew Dunning

I took part to a workshop about digital scholarly edition organized by
NeDiMAH last November
(http://www.nedimah.eu/call-for-papers/expert-meeting-digital-scholarly-editi=
ons)
and gave a paper titled "The battle we forgot to fight: Should we make a
case for digital editions?". In short, no, I think we should definitely
advocate creation and use of digital editions ... but also that first we
should define more clearly what a digital edition *is*, see Dot's
distinction above as a starting point (there surely are many other types
and sub-types). Personally I think we lack a clear perspective and need a
sort of "DEI" (Digital Edition Initiative) that can help interested
scholars with support, guidelines etc. (also help gather together,
conferences like ESTS and such are very useful, but we lack a "central"
place where to go).RDigital Medievalist --  http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/
