client-side XSLT processing, because our main UVic Web servers have no XSLT 
processor. In fact, they have only one CGI program (FormMail), disallow 
installation of your own PERL scripts, and are only now experimenting with 
adding PHP.>Many users have extremely out of date browsers which will display HTML

software produces output which only works on browsers released in the last 
three years; we sell steadily to customers all over the world, and the only 
complaints we've had about browser compatibility in the last six months 
have come from one US corporation and one US military unit, both of whom 
said they were not allowed to upgrade from IE5.5 to IE6 by their sysops. 
The rest of the world is happily moving forward, and with such a wealth of 
reasonably good browsers available, there's no reason to stick with an old 
browser (or at least, there's no reason to stick with ONLY an old browser, 
and avoid adding a new one to your system). The current Firefox download is 
less than 5 megs, and it runs happily on a Pentium 166 from 1996. Users who 
avoid updating IE are being a bit silly, because they're leaving open 
security holes. The only real problem platform is the remaining installed 
base of Mac OS 9 and below, for which there isn't really a good modern 
browserand this shrinks monthly and is pretty insignificant outside North 
America; even there, I think recent versions of Netscape will work.>  Many don't have browsers that have XSLT parsers built in. So it really

standards-compliant browsers if you're doing something complex that needs 
modern features. And I also think that encouraging people to go and get 
good browsers, by providing them with an incentive in the form of a site 
that makes good use of modern standards, is an all-around Good Thing.Cheers,
