*Annotating and resolving geographical names in historical sources*This seminar will focus on ancient Greek and Roman texts containing geographi=
cal information referred to real-world space. These sources challenge our per=
spective on way-finding and navigation, as the way they interpreted and expre=
ssed space was substantially different from ours. We will inspect currently e=
xisting strategies for the representation geospatial documents in the digital=
 environment, focusing on the topics of Named Entity Recognition, semi-automa=
tic and geo- annotation. We will highlight existing problems in the encoding =
of geospatial patterns in ancient geographical descriptions, focusing on what=
 is currently available and what can be done to improve this research.
