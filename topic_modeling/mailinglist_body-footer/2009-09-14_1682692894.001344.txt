I am neither a linguist nor a lexicographer... Although, I have long 
been tempted to use lexicographic tools on my sources (for the records, 
latin homiletic literature). I am particularly interested in 
cooccurrences, techniques of authorship attribution, and automatic 
identification of "borrowed" spans of text, for instance. The problem is 
I feel a bit clueless / helpless when it comes to put things into gear...Would any of you have already gone the same way, and could direct me to 
some introduction accessible to non-linguists, and maybe to some 
lexicometry softwares? I am particularly interested in softwares that 
would be able to deal "intelligently" with Latin (most of them seem to 
handle very nicely contemporary, widespread languages like English, but 
I haven't seen any specializing in Latin).Thanks!
