paleography knowledge --- works with Opera 9.64 on Linux (Ubuntu Hardy),
with midori 0.0.17, and Galeon 2.0.4 on the same system.This kind of exercises could be used even for learning to read old printed
books. Do you plan to make the sources for XSL, CSS and Java publicly
available somewhere?Yours,NevenNeven Jovanovic
