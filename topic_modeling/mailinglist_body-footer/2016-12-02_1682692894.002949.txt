DiXiT Workshop *The educational and social impact of Digital Scholarly
Editions* is fast approaching. More information below.DiXiT workshop: Call for ProposalsThe educational and social impact of Digital Scholarly EditionDeadline: December 10, 2016Digilab and DiXiT network (http://dixit.uni-koeln.de/) organize a one day
workshop on the educational application and social impact of digital
scholarly editions. The workshop will take place on *Tuesday, January 24,
2016*, in conjunction with the *AIUCD 2017 Conference *and the 3rd *EADH
Day *(aiucd2017.aiucd.it) at the Sapienza University of Roma.Keynote speech by *Agiatis Benardou*, Senior Researcher at the Digital
Curation Unit, ATHENA R.C. and manager of Europeana Research: “’Signatures
of all things I am here to read’: Digital Research as Practice, Digital
Networks as Public Engagement”.Invited talk by *Silvia Orlandi*, Associate Professor of Latin Epigraphy at
Sapienza University: “EAGLE dedicated services and their educational
potential”.The goal of the workshop is to share experiences and foster theoretical
reflections about the impact of digital scholarly editing products and
methods, primarily in the educational context, but also in the more general
social context. The use of digital technologies in teaching prompts a
reflection on the added value of using these technologies and raises some
controversial questions. At the same time, digital research outcomes and
methods should not be considered as separate from the more general cultural
and social context. In this sense, digital scholarly editions can play a
relevant role in the public engagement of humanities scholarship. These
topics can be articulated in the following issues:   -   the digital editions in teaching philology and textual criticism
   -   digital editions in disciplinary context
   -   digital editions and their social impact
   -   digital editions and academic publishing
   -   digital editions and public humanitiesThe organizers solicit proposals for interventions in form of papers, small
tutorials session, round table and lightening talks. *Abstracts of max 500
words can be submitted* via the AIUCD 2017 ConfTool, available at
*http://www.conftool.net/aiucd2017/
<http://www.conftool.net/aiucd2017/>*. The official language of the
Workshop is English.Submitters must create an account on the system and then use the specific
type of submission “DIXIT Workshop”. Notification of acceptance will be
communicated by December 20, 2016.
On behalf of the organising committee,Elena Spadini
