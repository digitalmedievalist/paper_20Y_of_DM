nothing at all, at least nothing that one could verify or which could 
help us to improve (the German comments are totally useless as well).There is no point in arguing against that kind of ungrounded statements.Fortunately, some people had already sent us off list some constructive 
criticisms and suggestions for improvements, for which we are grateful.While I appreciate the freedom of speech given by mailing lists, I do 
regret that some people are abusing this freedom to publically express 
feelings or unscholarly opinions ("I like" / "I don't like") in a way 
which would not be allowed in any other type of scholarly discussion.
