      Classics: Mellon Bridge Assistant Professorship*Greco-Roman and Islamic Traditions*The School of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University seeks a scholar who 
studies the contact between the Greco-Roman and Islamic traditions 
during any period through the Renaissance for a tenure-track Mellon 
Bridge Assistant Professorship, to begin September 2015. This 
newly-created position is being supported by a grant from the Mellon 
Foundation to promote scholarship and teaching that bridges different 
departments and programs in the humanities. Mellon Bridge professors 
will be grounded in one department but will also teach in other academic 
departments or programs, according to their areas of expertise.This position will have a primary appointment in the Department of 
Classics, and a secondary appointment in one or more of the following 
programs and departments: Arabic; Archaeology; Art History; History; 
International Relations; Middle Eastern Studies; Philosophy; Religion; 
Romance Languages; and a potentially new interdisciplinary master's 
program, Digital Technologies for Pre-Modern Studies, which is currently 
in the planning stage. The School will extend secondary appointments and 
cross-list courses in other departments and programs as appropriate. The 
successful candidate will receive an appointment as a fellow at the 
Center for the Humanities at Tufts (CHAT) for the duration of the 
pre-tenure probationary period.The intellectual emphasis of the Department of Classics is the 
transmission of knowledge across cultures and time. The Department 
currently teaches courses in Greek, Latin, Medieval Latin, and Sanskrit 
and in the archaeology and history of Egypt, the Greco-Roman world, 
Ancient Northern Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as in the 
comparison of Greek, Roman, and Chinese history. In addition, department 
members and affiliated faculty maintain teaching and research interests 
in the medieval and early modern world. The Department of Classics also 
houses the Perseus Digital Library, one of the largest and most actively 
used open-access humanities databases in the world—currently containing 
approximately 165 million searchable words in Greek, Latin, Arabic, 
French, German, Italian, and English, and receiving more than eight 
million visits last year alone, with a returning-visitor rate of 66%. 
Perseus's collections range from Homer through the Renaissance to 
nineteenth-century American literature and contemporary scholarship, and 
also include photographs and descriptions of art objects, buildings, and 
archaeological sites. The Perseus Perseids Platform, supported by a 
generous grant from the Mellon Foundation, is currently expanding Tufts' 
digital infrastructure by facilitating the publication, revision, and 
conservation of previously unavailable texts, other media, and original 
research by faculty and students.Applicants should demonstrate knowledge of Arabic as well as either 
Greek or Latin. Evidence of a strong record of scholarship is required. 
Doctorate and minimum of two years' full- or part-time teaching 
experience is required. We especially welcome candidates who can support 
student research at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. 
Candidates who are interested in augmenting the strengths of Tufts' 
Perseus Digital Library <http://www.perseus.tufts.edu> and its Perseids 
Platform in Greek, Latin, Classical Arabic, or other languages are 
especially encouraged to apply. The successful candidate will be 
expected to teach undergraduate courses related to his or her specific 
research area using works in translation, as well as to have the 
capacity to teach undergraduate and graduate courses on works in the 
original Latin and/or Greek.Applicants should submit a letter of application, /curriculum vitae/, 
writing sample (less than 20 pages), research and teaching statements 
(each no longer than a single-spaced page), and should arrange to have 
three confidential reference letters submitted directly by the authors, 
to: https://apply.interfolio.com/27062 
<https://apply.interfolio.com/27062>. Questions about the position may 
be directed to Search Committee Chair, Vickie Sullivan, at 
vickie.sullivan(a)tufts.edu <mailto:vickie.sullivan(a)tufts.edu>. Review of 
applications will begin November 21, 2014, and will continue until the 
position is filled.Tufts University is an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity employer. We 
are committed to increasing the diversity of our faculty. Members of 
underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.©2014 Tufts University. All rights reserved.  Site designed & maintained
