(Apologies for cross-posting) The Centre for Computing in the Humanties, Kings College London, is
again offering an EpiDoc Summer School, on July 14th-18th, 2008. The
training is designed for epigraphers and papyrologists (or related
text editors such as numismatists, sigillographers, etc.) who would
like to learn the skills and tools required to mark up ancient
documents for publication (online or on paper), and interchange with
international academic standards. You can learn more about EpiDoc from
the EpiDoc home page [1] and the Introduction for Epigraphers [2]; you
wil find a recent and user-friendly article on the subject in the
Digital Medievalist [3]. (If you want to go further, you can learn
about XML [4] and about the principles of the Text Encoding Initiative
[5].) The Summer School will not expect any technical expertise, and
training in basic XML will be provided. Attendees (who should be familiar with Greek/Latin and the Leiden
Conventions) will need to bring a laptop on which has been installed
the Oxygen XML editor [6] (available at a reduced academic price, or
for a free 30-day demo). The EpiDoc Summer School is free to participants; we can try to help
you find cheap (student) accommodation in London. If any students
participating would like to stay on afterwards and acquire some
hands-on experience marking up some texts for the Inscriptions of
Roman Cyrenaica project [7], they would be most welcome! All interested please contact both charlotte.roueche(a)kcl.ac.uk and
gabriel.bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk as soon as possible. Please pass on this
message to anyone who you think might benefit. Links:
