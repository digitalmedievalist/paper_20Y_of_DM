Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableHi Marjorie,I was talking about data and resources from the perspective of the maintenanc=
e problems they produce rather than intrinsic qualities. But I would still ma=
intain that there is a fundamental epistemological difference between outputs=
 and processes, or as I called them, data and projects/resources (in broad te=
rms, I'd say the difference between a project and a resource is that the form=
er has an end date and the later doesn't; but both are processes).To me, the important thing about data is that they exist and they are used fo=
r something (that's even built into the etymology of the term). We can distin=
guish between primary and secondary data, but data are still the stuff you bu=
ild your interpretation and analysis from. In English in the humanities we ca=
ll them "primary and secondary resources," but that is a historical accident:=
 in print, everything is ultimately data, since it is fixed on the page at so=
me point and your maintenance issues become purely archival (something I woul=
d say is a defining feature of data as opposed to processes); while there are=
 resources in my sense in the print world--e.g. journals--the temptation to b=
uild resources is less in that world than in the digital, since the commitmen=
t is so much more obvious.So to give an example. If I am writing an article about the appearance of the=
 phoenix in the OE Phoenix poem, my data are "the poem," the other secondary =
work I cite, reference works I use, and so on. I'm guessing your analysis wou=
ld say only "the poem" is data in this case. But if it were, then I would ask=
 "what do you mean by 'the poem'"? If I use a transcription or an edition, I'=
m really accessing the text through a secondary source that has analysis buil=
t into it. I don't see the difference between basing my reading of a poem on =
an edition and basing my analysis of a concept on some secondary work on that=
 concept. You might say that this problem goes away if I base my readings on =
the manuscript itself, but I'd say you aren't actually changing anything: you=
 are still basing your readings on an interpretation, the only difference is =
that you did the textual interpretation upon which your analysis is based you=
rself instead of relying on that of an outsider.However, in this thread, we were talking about the project management implica=
tions, and I'd say the distinction is even stronger there. Seen from the prod=
ucer side, data are the outputs of your project or resource which others use =
for their own work. Seen from the consumer side, they are information from a =
project or resource that you inherit, acquire, produce, or extend through fur=
ther accumulation, and, then, presumably, analyse and use for higher research=
 purposes.  The key thing is that data ultimately has to be in some sense iso=
latable in order to be used. Data by its very nature represents a snap-shot i=
n time and/or conceptual space.My argument was that you should take advantage of this property and always st=
rive to ensure that your projects result in something that can be considered =
in some sense "finished". That's not the same thing as saying "definitive" or=
 "complete": good data leads to additional questions and revisions. But what =
I mean is you should always strive to have outputs that you can exist as a sn=
ap-shot in time or conceptual space and that could remain useful when you are=
 dead or no longer interested in maintaining them. And that means getting the=
m in a shape where they can be archived by professionals and don't require ac=
tive maintenance.The only reason why this was important is because it is easier in the digital=
 world than in the print to accidentally turn data into resources by adding s=
econdary features that raise almost impossible maintenance burdens. One examp=
le of this is deciding that you want to control who extends your data or how =
they do it: for example, by deciding you are going to referee future addition=
s or insist that others follow your protocols; another is wrapping your data =
up so tightly in a specific processing environment or process that you will l=
ose the data if you fail to maintain the processor.I guess if I had to sum up, I'd say: data is something that can be archived a=
nd resources are things that need to be maintained (and so can't be archived).My argument was that that resources carry incredibly heavy costs with them an=
d, in the long run, will always fail (Chaucer never did manage to revoke all =
his licentious tales, after all). So if you decide your data must be publishe=
d in a form that requires active subsequent maintenance, realise what you are=
 setting yourself up for and try to design it so that it degrades well when p=
eople cease to maintain it. But better, try to distinguish between your resou=
rces and data from the very beginning and see all resources as temporary thin=
gs.-dan

Subject: Re: [dm-l] Re: How to make your data live forever (and maybe your pr=
oject?)Hi Dan!
Maybe this is a bit side-tracked, but I would argue with the definition of da=
ta and resource that you give (data most of all). To me data is raw, primary =
material, and I am not comfortable considering articles, monographs, dictiona=
ries or edited texts as data, for instance. They are an elaborate, secondary =
material, they are knowledge produced from data, but not data themselves.
As for resource, to me it can be a simple means to access data or more elabor=
ate material, but that's not my main definition of a resource. I would call a=
 resource any coherent set of material, primary or secondary - for instance t=
o me the Online Froissart is a resource on Froissart's chronicle; I would als=
o call a resource, to a certain extent, a project providing users with nifty =
means of processing a set of data (for instance, the project preparing the di=
gital edition of Flaubert's "Bouvard et P=C3=A9cuchet" put a lot of efforts i=
nto building an interface that would let the user navigate through Flaubert's=
 material for his unfinished novel and make hypothesis about its potential co=
nstruction - an interface which is fully part of the project).
It seems to me that there are more projects aiming at producing resources rat=
her than data, which can explain why they are so difficult to maintain. The c=
oherence would be lost if the material was just poured and melted into a larg=
e data repository, or the data would lose most of its interest if separated f=
rom the specific tools created by a project to process it.Maybe this distinction can shed some different light on the issue: curation o=
f secondary material is a long-established tradition, through libraries, but =
curation of data is a different kettle of fish. There are not powerful pre-ex=
isting traditions and models as for secondary material, and the digital lore =
has to invent them quickly. As for resources (according to my definition), th=
eir inherent coherence and the often very strong link between data/material a=
nd the interface created to use it means that maintaining the interface is a =
often central issue, and one that is particularly difficult to solve in the l=
ong term.Best, Marjorie

Personally, I think you need to make two or maybe three distinctions: between=
 data, resources (maybe), and projects.* Projects create and/or analyse data. They have a definite beginning and end=
 and they are run by somebody. This means the main preservation problem is ho=
w you keep them going until they "finish." Once they finish, their outputs ar=
e either data or resources or both. An example of a project might be the prod=
uction of edition of a text, a monograph, journal article, or a specific edit=
ion of a dictionary or an encyclopedia.
* Data are created by projects. They are in essence static (though they can b=
e corrected or revised). Ideally they can be reused by other projects, either=
 with or without negotiation (though this is in practice often very difficult=
). The preservation problem with data is hosting and discoverability. Example=
s of data might be photos, 3D scans, transcriptions, edited texts, editions o=
f dictionaries or encyclopedias, monographs and journal articles, and so on.
* Resources are things that provide access to data: e.g. digital libraries, e=
dition interfaces, dictionary or edition interfaces, and so on. These are thi=
ngs that may need to be actively maintained and updated if they are to remain=
 useful. Examples of resources include encyclopedia or dictionary sites, jour=
nals, perhaps monograph series, scholarly societies, and so on.If this makes sense, then I think the organisational issues are different in =
each case.* With projects, the transfer is always going to be negotiated: you are talki=
ng about a small group of people who share a common goal and understanding of=
 the project (more or less) and when a transfer happens, you are going to see=
 a handoff: one leader or group hands off control to another under specific c=
onditions. Projects are usually organised around a single leader, or a couple=
 of co-leaders, or a small board. The problem for projects is really the same=
, whether the project is paper-based or digital.* For data, you are looking for maintenance that is as hands off as possible =
and transfer that can happen without negotiation. The important question here=
 is whether the data is discoverable, comprehensible, and accessible. Hence P=
eter's point about licencing, for example, and about institutional repositori=
es or the Oxford Text Archive. For data, you don't really need a board or a c=
hair or anything else (in fact if you need it, it is probably not being well =
stored). You need some institution that is already established and is willing=
 to accept your data under conditions you both find acceptable as part of its=
 mission. Universities and libraries are good methods for this. Again, the pr=
oblem is not really too dissimilar between paper and digital: you want as muc=
h as possible to give your data in static form to an institution that is set =
up to preserve it.* Resources are the hardest things to preserve, because there is no obvious e=
nd date, but they may require active intervention. Because of this, I think y=
ou should do everything you can to avoid creating them. If you are designing =
an edition, you should design it so that it degrades well over time and can b=
e treated like data (whether as a whole or in its component parts). This mean=
s making use of components that are built into the architecture of the web as=
 much as possible and separating content from processing. Good examples inclu=
de Stuart Lee's edition of =C3=86lfric's sermons, Murray McGillvray's Book of=
 the Duchess, I'd argue my edition of Caedmon's Hymn, any post P2 version of =
the TEI. A famously poor example (though it isn't their fault) is the BBC's D=
omesday Project from the late 1980s. The exceptions to this rule are by-and-l=
arge not research projects: scholarly societies, for example, are resources r=
ather than projects or data, but if they stop, it is because nobody is intere=
sted in them anymore. MESA is a resource that referees data. But if it dies, =
the data still survives. If you do build a resource (for example, a journal o=
r a scholarly society), you should do everything you can to ensure that it de=
grades to data when people lose interest in it: so your journals should be ho=
sted by or mirrored at universities and archives, for example, and should not=
 depend too much on dynamic libraries for expression.So in the end the answer to your question might be this: do everything you ca=
n to avoid creating a resource. Make sure that your data production is tied t=
o a project rather than a resource and has a definite end-point in sight. If =
you want to create data that others will revise and add to after you are fini=
shed with it, don't try to be the arbiter of the quality of their interventio=
ns. Understand what they are doing as independent projects that are responsib=
le for seeking their own quality assurance. Create URLs or other identifiers =
that archives can administer without your help. Publish guidelines and sugges=
tions for how subsequent generations might add to your data, but give up on e=
nforcing them.In other words, try to imitate the Chaucer of the epilogue to Troilus and Cri=
seyde  ("go litel bok, go little myn tragedie") rather than the Chaucer of th=
e epilogue to the Canterbury Tales ("...the whiche I revoke in my retraccioun=

4. To give some momentum to the project should interest wane for a period aft=

Subject: How to make your data live forever (and maybe your project?)HI David
I think you are hitting upon a very sore point in the DH/editorial communitie=
s.  We have had editorial projects launched all over the place, with great en=
thusiasm and often, substantial funding.  Many now face exactly the problem y=
ou outline: what happens after the PI/institution move on?
So, here are three things you can do which will help immensely:
1.  Explicitly declare all your materials as Creative Commons Share-alike att=
ribution: that is, **without** the 'non-commercial' use restrictions so often=
 (and wrongly) imposed by many projects.
2.  Place the data, so licensed, on any open server.  The Oxford Text Archive=
 is, after so many years, still the best place I know to put your data.
That alone should be enough to make your data live forever.  And wonderfully,=
 these two options will cost you not a cent, and maybe just  a few hours of y=
our time to deal with the OTA deposit pack.Optionally, you could also:
3.  Place the data within an institutional repositiory.  This gives you the o=
ption to use the IR tools to construct an interface, and provide basic search=
 and other tools.  In my mind, this option has been scandalously underused by=
 DH projects, for reasons which might be the subject of another post.  But th=
is does provide the opportunity for you to present your project in a way that=
 will connect its metadata with the whole world of OASIS etc tools, and offer=
 a sustainable interface.  The University of Birmingham Research Archive give=
s some idea of how this might work: see (for example) the entries for the Min=
gana collection (eg http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/84/) and Codex Sinaiticus ( htt=
p://epapers.bham.ac.uk/1690/).There is another answer:
1.  Keep the 'non-commercial' licence restriction on your data.  You can ther=
eby claim that you are allowing all your fellow academics to use it freely, w=
hile (if you choose) not actually making it freely available outside your int=
erface.
2.  Create an elaborate and very attractive interface to your data
3.  Persuade your university, or someone, to set up a DH centre, with a minim=
um staff of a director and programmer, space and dedicated equipment (say, 10=
0K a year if you can swing this with part-time staff etc).  This DH centre wi=
ll then have the task of maintaining your data (which of course, only the cen=
tre has), interface and project.  This centre can then deal with all the issu=
es you raise in your post.
4.  Persuade your university, or someone, to support data, interface and proj=
ect, in perpetuityWell, good luck with that!Peter
