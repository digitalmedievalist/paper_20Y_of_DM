ovatingknowledge.nl/> project (Huygens Institute, Amsterdam) just released a =
digital edition of the glosses to the first book of the Etymologiae of Isidor=
e of Seville.This digital edition makes use of network visualizations to display the relat=
ionships between the manuscript witnesses, to map these relationships against=
 the geographical background, and to showcase how the glosses are distributed=
 across the text. All in all, the edition contains approximately 4,280 glosse=
s as found in more than 50 early medieval manuscripts, including vernacular, =
Tironian and dry-point glosses.You can find the edition at: https://db.innovatingknowledge.nl/editionTogether with the edition, we are also publishing the raw data<https://innova=
tingknowledge.nl/?page_id=3D104> behind the edition in a hope that they can b=
e further reused by other projects. The TEI-XML file, the XML schema, and the=
 software code of the edition are also published<https://github.com/HuygensIN=
G/isidore-glosses> today in a dedicated GitHub repository.I am also very glad that the data from the edition was also published on our =
partner project, the GlossEngine<http://www.glossing.org/glossengine/collecti=
ons.php>.I hope that many of you will find this edition useful and inspiring.Best wishes,EvinaEvina Steinova
