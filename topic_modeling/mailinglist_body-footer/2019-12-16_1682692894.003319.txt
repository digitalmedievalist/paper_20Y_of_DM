e, FranceDescriptionLT4HALA is a one-day workshop that seeks to bring together scholars who are d=
eveloping and/or are using Language Technologies (LTs) for historically attes=
ted languages, so to foster cross-fertilization between the Computational Lin=
guistics community and the areas in the Humanities dealing with historical li=
nguistic data, e.g. historians, philologists, linguists, archaeologists and l=
iterary scholars. Despite the current availability of large collections of di=
gitized texts written in historical languages, such interdisciplinary collabo=
ration is still hampered by the limited availability of annotated linguistic =
resources for most of the historical languages. Creating such resources is a =
challenge and an obligation for LTs, both to support historical linguistic re=
search with the most updated technologies and to preserve those precious ling=
uistic data that survived from past times.Relevant topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:=E2=97=8F      handling spelling variation;=E2=97=8F      detection and correction of OCR errors;=E2=97=8F      creation and annotation of digital resources;=E2=97=8F      deciphering;=E2=97=8F      morphological/syntactic/semantic analysis of textual data;=E2=97=8F      adaptation of tools to address diachronic/diatopic/diastratic =
variation in texts;=E2=97=8F      teaching ancient languages with NLP tools;=E2=97=8F      NLP-driven theoretical studies in historical linguistics;=E2=97=8F      evaluation of NLP tools.Shared TasksJust because of the limited amount of data preserved for historical and ancie=
nt languages, an important role is played by evaluation practices, to underst=
and the level of accuracy of the NLP tools used to build and analyze resource=
s. Given the prominence of Latin, by virtue of its wide diachronic and diatop=
ic span covering two millennia all over Europe, the workshop will host the fi=

fSgRpJ%2BwsMdQPTXEZGyYGP%2BROAcIojk3uZC9M%3D&reserved=3D0>, an evaluation cam=
paign entirely devoted to the evaluation of NLP tools for Latin. The first ed=
ition of EvaLatin will focus on two tasks (i.e. Lemmatization and PoS tagging=
), each featuring three sub-tasks (i.e. Classical, Cross-Genre, Cross-Time). =
These sub-tasks are designed to measure the impact of genre and diachrony on =
NLP tools performances, a relevant aspect to keep in mind when dealing with t=
he diachronic and diatopic diversity of Latin. Participants will be provided =
with shared data in the CoNLL-U format and the evaluation script.SubmissionsFor the workshop, we invite papers of different types such as experimental pa=
pers, reproduction papers, resource papers, position papers, survey papers. B=
oth long and short papers describing original and unpublished work are welcom=
e. Long papers should deal with substantial completed research and/or report =
on the development of new methodologies. They may consist of up to 8 pages of=
 content plus 2 pages of references. Short papers are instead appropriate for=
 reporting on works in progress or for describing a singular tool or project.=
 They may consist of up to 4 pages of content plus 2 pages of references. We =
encourage the authors of papers reporting experimental results to make their =
results reproducible and the entire process of analysis replicable, by making=
 the data and the tools they used available. The form of the presentation may=
 be oral or poster, whereas in the proceedings there is no difference between=
 the accepted papers. The submission is NOT anonymous. The <https://eur03.saf=
