Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Franz,Your thoughts on why there is a gap concerning the degree to which image cont=
ent is catalogued, the lack of a common taxonomy/terminology and expertise ar=
e, to some extent, probably correct. However, in the visual arts, there has b=
een considerable development on common terminology and taxonomy (the Getty In=
stitute in NA for one has been quite active in supporting the development of =
controlled vocabularies -- ULAN, AAT, TGN, CONA -- as well as the work of the=
 Visual Resources Association concerning metadata schema, VRA Core http://www=
.loc.gov/standards/vracore/schemas.html ), which I think is often overlooked =
by institutions taking on large scale digitization projects. This is probably=
 due to the lack of expertise or knowledge about this field and probably also=
 due to the way digitization projects have evolved, separately, from visual c=
ollections. Increasingly, I can see a major role for libarians/cataloguers wi=
th visual studies/art history backgrounds in this area as technology begins t=
o enable us to bring collections together between and within institutions. Th=
ank you for suggesting the Horvolt bibliography and I see that she does refer=
ence Iconclass which is applicable to a number of different historical period=
s (and used by the larger European image collections, such as Marburg, as wel=
l as, at Princeton, ICA, and other sites in NA). I don't think many specialis=
ts outside the visual area are aware of this resource for cataloguing image c=
ontent. However, I realize that current technology does pose additional issue=
s on this complex topic - but, I think this is an area which needs to be exam=
ined in greater detail. Setting standards and guidelines enabling this might =
be the first step in exploring more collaboration. Thank you for thinking abo=
ut this...Harriet.

Subject: Re: [dm-l] Image Content in Digital Projects and MetadataDear Harriet,The degree to which images are described in TEI and the frequency varies of c=
ourse as much as there are projects creating manuscript descriptions. A highe=
r standardization and deeper structuring of the content of <decoDesc>s and <d=
ecoNote>s is desirable - but hard to achieve for the lack of a common termino=
logy or taxonomy and not least for the lack of expertise of cataloguers.BTW, there is a selected bibliography on decoration of manuscripts by Hanna V=
orholt available on the DiXiT webpage (course material of MMSDA
2014):
