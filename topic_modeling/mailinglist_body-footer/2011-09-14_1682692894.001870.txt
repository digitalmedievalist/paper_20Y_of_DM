workshop at Kalamazoo 2012 that will introduce the basic topics and methods
of digital humanities for medieval studies.  This "call" asks for two
things:1.  What kind of topics would medievalists like to see at this session?  We
will only have 90 minutes, so it won't be possible to cover everyting.
 However, if there is a consensus on (or just a large demand for) a given
topic or topics, I want to make sure this workshop covers them.  Possible
topics could be: "what is text encoding and why should I like it?" "How to
talk to software developers nicely to get them to do what I need." "Why
should I have to know about databases?"  "Should I learn the basics of a
programming language and how would I go about doing that?  So if there is
something you've always wanted to ask about doing digital work, or if there
is certain things you as an established DHer think every digital medievalist
should now, please send me your ideas.  I am happy to credit the source(s)
of all ideas.2.  Are there any brave volunteers who would like to facilitate this kind of
workshop?  Are there any of you who have already done this type of workshop
and would like to take your show on the road?  If so, send me your contact
details, and a very brief description of your instructional experience by 15
September (or so).Regards
Jim
