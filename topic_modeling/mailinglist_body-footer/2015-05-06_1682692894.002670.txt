(SIMS) are thrilled to announce the launch of OPenn: Primary Resources
Available to Everyone (http://openn.library.upenn.edu
<http://openn.library.upenn.edu/> ), a new website that makes digitized
cultural heritage material freely available and accessible to the public.
OPenn is a major step in the Libraries' strategic initiative to embrace
open data, with all images and metadata on this site available as free
cultural works to be freely studied, applied, copied, or modified by
anyone, for any purpose. OPenn launches with the entire corpus of
manuscripts donated to the Penn Libraries in 2011 by SIMS founder Lawrence
J. Schoenberg and his wife Barbara Brizdle Schoenberg.  The Schoenberg
Collection features manuscripts from all over the world, with a focus on
science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  To interest the public
in the visual splendor of materials on OPenn we have uploaded some images
from the Schoenberg Collection onto Flickr at http://tinyurl.com/mm84j7s,
with links in the records to OPenn.More datasets, including manuscripts from the University of Pennsylvania's
own holdings and items from other institutions, will be added to the site
in the near future, so stay tuned.  Historic diaries from a variety of
institutions belonging to the Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special
Collections Libraries (PACSCL <http://pacscl.org/> ) are next in line for
inclusion on OPenn.  Many of these documents are unknown while others are
celebrated, such as the Union League's Tanner manuscript: a firsthand
account of the events surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.Images of the manuscripts are currently available on OPenn at full
resolution, with derivatives also provided for easy reuse on the web.
Downloading, whether several select images or the entire dataset, is
easily accomplished by following instructions or recipes posted in the
Technical Read Me <http://openn.library.upenn.edu/TechnicalReadMe.html>
on OPenn.  The website is designed to be machine-readable, but easy for
individuals to use, too.Dot Porter of SIMS has already used the dataset to create e-books from the
images and metadata on OPenn.  You can download the e-books in the free
and open epub format at Penn Libraries' Scholarly Commons
<http://repository.upenn.edu/sims_ebooks/> .   She has also used the
Internet Archive BookReader <https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/bookreader>
, an open source online page-turning book reader, to generate online
versions of each manuscript.  An example using LJS 225, Litterarum
simulationis liber, can be seen at:
http://dorpdev.library.upenn.edu/BookReaders/ljs225/#page/4/mode/2up .
You can search and browse manuscripts in OPenn (along with digitized
manuscripts from The Digital Walters) here:
http://viewshare.org/views/leoba/openn-and-digital-walters/.  These are just a few ways the data can be manipulated.  We hope you are
inspired to reuse OPenn data and to share your project with the world.  If
you have any questions or comments, send us an email at
openn(a)pobox.upenn.edu.
