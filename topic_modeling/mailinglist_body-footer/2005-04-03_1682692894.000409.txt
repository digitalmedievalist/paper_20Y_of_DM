Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHi all,
     I've been playing with LaTex (actually MikTex) as a TEI2PDF 
conversion method, and I have a question about unicode support for LaTex 
that members of this list might have a better handle on than the TUG 
group seems to.
     What is the best method of handling UTF-8 XML code in LaTeX2e? 
Recent discussion (i.e. Feb 2005) on the various mailing lists archived 
at TUG seem to suggest this is something that is difficult to do and 
won't really be resolved until LaTeX 3. I'm sure members here have some 
practical experience.
     Thanks.
