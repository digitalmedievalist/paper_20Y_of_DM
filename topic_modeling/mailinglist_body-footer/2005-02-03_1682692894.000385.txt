Library Association on innovative digital projects in the humanities.  I
would be interested in any innovative digital projects that you feel
incorporate interesting content with fascinating and state-of-the-art
technology in the humanities.  This includes websites, CDs, 2D and 3D
presentations, etc.  Please forward information to me personally (not to
the listserv).  Thanks for your attention.
