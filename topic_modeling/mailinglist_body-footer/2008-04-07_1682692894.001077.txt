Subject: Digitization Workshop at Kalamazoo Medieval Congress
Date: Mon, 7 Apr 2008 11:00:41 -0400Digitization of Primary Materials for Medievalists: A WorkshopPart of the International Congress on Medieval Studies, Kalamazoo, Michigan
Sponsored by the Medieval Academy of America's Committee on Electronic Resour=
ces
Hosted by the Western Michigan University Libraries' Digitization CenterFriday, May 9, 1:30-5:00The process of digitization project planning is essential for
endeavors large and small. Every project to digitize medieval primary
sources, whether undertaken by major libraries or by individual
scholars, must take into account issues of legality (can I post these
digital images on the web?), equipment (can I use a flatbed scanner,
or should I use a camera?), specifications (300 or 600 dpi? And what's
dpi??) and metadata standards (what's metadata?). Our seminar,
"Elements of Digitization Project Planning" will describe why a
Digitization Project Plan is essential for every project, and will go
over what each element of a project plan entails. We will discuss the
nine elements of successful project planning, and show resources and
references for developing digitization project plans. Experienced
professionals, including librarians and image experts, will share
their expertise and provide examples of previous successful project
plans. We will also cover other important aspects of digitization
technology, including the methodology and technology of digital
preservation.Registration is $50 for members of the Medieval Academy of America and
$65 for non-members.

Space is limited to 35.--=20
