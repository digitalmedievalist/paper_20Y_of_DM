Thank you again for the feedback! The Verba list contains indeed a number of =
medieval graphical variants, but sadly not all of them. Please take notice th=
at diphtongues are rendered the medieval way, with a simple "e", so you will =
find "celum" but not "coelum", "ecclesia" but not "aecclesia", etc.=20
But "Ihesus" and "michi" are perfect examples of medieval particularities tha=
t should be available in Enigma, and I have just added them :) If you spot ot=
her words and forms that should be added, please do not hesitate to report th=
em to me.=20
Best regards,=20

Objet: New resource: Enigma - Unpuzzling difficult Latin readings in medieval=
 manuscripts=20Madame,=20Thank you for your quick response.=20When reading >characters< in your directions for the use of >Enigma<, I had i=
n mind ascii characters and things of that sort (that include blanks, e.g.). =
Now I see that in >Enigma< dots stand for letters. But when seeking, e.g., >s=
ic ut<; >simul ac< or >pro dolor<, I can obviously do it by putting an asteri=
sk instead of a dot for a blank (sic*ut; simul*ac; pro*dolor).=20As a Medieval Latinist, I am glad to find yronia, karitas, nichil (not so aec=
clesia, michi, Ihesus, coelum, which are >possible Latin forms< in medieval m=
anuscripts).=20Your tool runs very fast.=20Thank you again for putting it online.=20Best, Udo Kindermann=20Dr Udo Kindermann=20Professor emerit. of Medieval Latin=20University at Cologne=2050923 KÃ¶ln=20Germany=20
