stration. An encounter with the 14th century fragmentary Cocharelli Codex, di=
spersed in collections in London, Florence and Cleveland, led to a PhD under =
the supervision of Emeritus Professor Margaret Manion, to reconstruct transcr=
ibe and translate its text for the first time, and analyse the rich profusion=
 of illustration gracing every page. An intrepid 'fragmentologist', she seeks=
 to locate and virtually piece together the fragments of medieval manuscripts=

ermine the editorial origin of charter texts. In 2012 she received a COST Act=
