Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear list,What online bible versions for general references would you suggest?I am interested in any biblical text freely available online, the can be clea=
rly addressed (preferably on the verse level) and that provides a reliable ve=
rsion of the Septuagint, Hexapla, Greek New Testament, Vulgate, Vetus Latina,=
 Arabic, Syriac and Coptic text,
as well as translations into modern languages such as English, Irish, German,=
 French, Italian, Portuguese etc.
As for the Vulgate, the Septuagint, the Hebrew OT and most of the translation=
s I think I'm happy with http://www.bibleserver.com but this is most likely j=
ust the symptom of being ignorant ...Any hint to lists or overviews of biblical mss (such as http://en.wikipedia.o=
rg/wiki/List_of_New_Testament_Latin_manuscripts) are most welcome too.Many thanks in advance for any remark or advice,
Franz--
