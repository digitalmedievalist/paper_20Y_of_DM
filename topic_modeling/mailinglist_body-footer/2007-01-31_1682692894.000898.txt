between the University Press and the University Library, all components of
the online "Middle English Compendium," including the online version of the
Middle English Dictionary, are now freely accessible without fee, password,
or any other impediment to access:
<http://ets.umdl.umich.edu/m/mec>The MED has hitherto been available only on a subscription or
password-protected basis, till the Press recouped its substantial
contribution to the original conversion costs. This has now been
accomplished, and we are grateful for their agreement that the time has come
to liberate it.It was always our hope and intention to open the MED when we could, both in
the general interest of public access (to which as a public university
library we are dedicated), and with the expectation that open access will
facilitate eventual interlinking amongst sibling dictionaries and between
MED and other projects (e.g. online editions, which are now free to link
lexical lookups to the appropriate MED entry).The official press release is here:
