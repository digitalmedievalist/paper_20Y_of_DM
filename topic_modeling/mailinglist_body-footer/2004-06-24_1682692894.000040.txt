Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThanks to those who've said nice things about Junicode here. I don't 
have a Mac, since I can't afford to buy one and haven't yet managed to 
talk anyone into buying me one (heu!); so I can only test by getting 
reports from friends. The new version of Word for the Mac does, finally, 
handle Unicode, so it should work with Junicode. Martin, it may be that 
you have a copy of Junicode from a couple of versions ago. If I remember 
rightly only the regular style had runes, and I had inadvertently 
released italic or bold fonts that had vertical strokes as placeholders 
throughout the runic range. It may be that your font application is 
displaying those placeholders. If so, the problem will go away when you 
download and install the latest version.PeterMartin K. Foys wrote:> On Wed, 23 Jun 2004 19:37:07 -0700
