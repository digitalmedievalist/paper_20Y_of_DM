    I'd like to return to a question I asked early on in the list 
regarding acronyms. I can't find the original thread in the archives. 
I'd originally asked about web sites that define computer acronyms. A 
couple of people suggested different sources. Would you be willing to 
resend the info? I'd like to add the link to the acronym section of our 
new wiki-based faq <http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Acronyms> 
(accessible from the new DM site: <http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/>).    I'm planning to go through the e-mail archive for the last several 
months looking for items that we could include in the wiki. If you know 
of something or see a lacuna, please consider adding it yourself or let 
me know. We've also had several important announcements of tools, 
software, utilities, etc. I wouldn't mind posting these in the new item. 
I'll be contacting people who have announced things privately over the 
next couple of weeks to get information. Please feel free to contact me 
first in the meantime. We don't have a "submit your own news item" form 
ready yet. That will be coming shortly.
