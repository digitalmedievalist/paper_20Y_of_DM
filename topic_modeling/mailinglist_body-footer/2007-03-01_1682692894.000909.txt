Medievalist" in Wikipedia has been deleted by the administrators on the
grounds that it "read like an advertisement". Apparently the entry needs
to be sober and encyclopedic and cite third party references. Easy
enough to do, but apparently no one did.(I'm just fresh from the battle to prevent the same happening to the
Digital Classicist entry, but does anyone want to come along and help
reinstate the DM page?)Cheers,Dr Gabriel BODARDInscriptions of Aphrodisias
