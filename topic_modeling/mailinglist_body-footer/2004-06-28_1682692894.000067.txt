mailing list very useful and I start my contribution with a question.Is there any sort of DTD designed with the purpose of describing a 
medieval manuscript, not just in its physical features as a global 
object, but in its palaeographical features?I mean any kind of XML grill and hierarchy able to encounter 
description and comments on the shape of letters, of ligatures and so 
on, even related just to one period and one handwritten style.I know the TEI guidelines and the efforts of some specific projects such
as Digital Scriptorium, but none of them seems to me to go into the 
image with the granularity needed for a palaeographical analysis.Cheers,Arianna Ciula----------------------
