The UK's Arts and Humanities Data Service has a number of excellent
on-line Guides to Good Practice that are applicable.  The whole catalog
can be found at (http://www.ahds.ac.uk/creating/guides/index.htm).  I
especially like Ian Gregory's "A Place in History: A Guide to Using GIS in
Historical Research".Rob Haug
