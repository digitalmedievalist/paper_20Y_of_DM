that provides access to electronic medieval Latin texts and an integrated bib=
liography.  The textbase is composed of a variety of Latin texts (most of the=
m under copyright but still searchable).  Right now the search engine is pret=
ty primitive, and one enhancement I would like to make is to account for orth=
ographical variants in the texts.  Some texts were classicized, while other e=
ditors followed either the orthography of a single manuscript or attempted to=
 follow some sort of convention based generally on Latin texts in later medie=
val England (these are the facts, and this post is not about the joy of debat=
ing editorial practice).  Ideally, I would like to allow searches to include =
returns for classical and "medieval" spellings.  For example, if a user queri=
ed "scientia" the engine would return matches for "scientia" and "sciencia". =
(wildcards are permitted, btw).=20Now I work in Perl5, and so my initial thought was to create a set of hash ta=
bles that would map these variants since hashes would allow for more than one=
 variant per entity, and the engine would then perform a lookup for each quer=
y element.  Now I suppose coding into the engine the "orthographical rules" i=
s another option, but I'll be honest and admit that computational linguistics=
 has never been my thing.  And, the beauty of hashes in Perl is that they are=
 compiled very quickly, and don't eat too much memory.=20Now before I go and reinvent the wheel with these hash tables, does anyone kn=
ow of an open-source method or resource that addresses this kind of problem (=
I know that Brepols--pardon me, Brepolis...yeesh---has this all figured out b=
ut they don't play will with others, so that's a closed door.).  My limited s=
couring of the web has yielded no joy, and so I seek the sage advice of this =
community. =20Many thanks
