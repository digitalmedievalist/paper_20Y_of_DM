sted in discussions, hackathons, new project planning, and other practical ac=
tivities, in the area of Linked Open Data and the historical world.(1) Call for Activities:There will be space for suggestion and selection of activities at the confere=
nce, but we also welcome proposals for research activities, which may include=
 (but are not restricted to): development of standards, ontologies and resear=
ch applications; discovery and integration of datasets; enrichment and annota=
tion of textual collections; collaboration, pedagogy and community expansion;=
 other relevant undertakings with a focus on Linked Open Data and the histori=
cal world.To propose a stream or working group for the conference programme, please fil=
l in the form at <https://forms.gle/Z3aj3UfixTNENyaB8> with a max. 200-word a=
bstract outlining your suggestion, type of activity and the medium in which i=
t will be run, and some indication of the likely participants (e.g. names, co=
mmunity or expected stakeholders) by the end of Monday October 18, 2021.(2) Call for posters:In the absence of individual presentations and lectures, posters are a great =

 with other interested attendees. We will hold an online digital poster sessi=
on available throughout the symposium. To propose a poster, please send an ab=
