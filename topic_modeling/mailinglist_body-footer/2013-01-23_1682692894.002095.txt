out earlier this month. Guest-edited by Tracy Adams, this exciting new
number is devoted to explore the links between "Devotion and Emotions in the
Middle Ages," or rather, in the editor's own words "the work to which our
medieval forebears put what we today think of as emotions: how they used
emotions for making sense of human nature, keeping the peace, educating
communities, marking social distinctions." The current issue of Digital
Philology also includes a manuscript study and three reviews of digital
resources. You may access DPh 1.2 on-line through Project Muse at:  <http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/digital_philology/toc/dph.1.2.html> We are accepting submissions for the 2014 and 2015 open issues. You may find
