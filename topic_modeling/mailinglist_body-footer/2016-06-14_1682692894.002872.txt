Digital edition of freshly excavated cuneiform tablets on OraccWhy edit texts using digital tools? And why produce online editions in 
an open access environment? This seminar explores the many benefits, 
from ensuring editorial consistency to maximising accessibility for 
readers and researchers. I will explore the principles and practice with 
examples from my current work, which happens to deal with newly 
excavated cuneiform tablets from southern Iraq, from a previously 
little-documented period of Babylonian history. But the same basic 
theories and methods are relevant to all periods, places, and genres of 
text, and are useful to think about for both creators and users of text 
editions.http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2016.htmlALL WELCOME--
