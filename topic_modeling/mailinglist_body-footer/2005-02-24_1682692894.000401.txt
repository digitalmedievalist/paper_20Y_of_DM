already have a database, but you may wish to look at eXist.  It is a 
free, opensource, native XML database.  This would be a database way of
working with XML texts that is designed for just that purpose.  One of 
the many ways to query such databases is with XQuery (W3C XML Query), 
which is kind of like SQL by for XML Databases.See:   http://www.exist-db.org/  for more information.-James
