views for a special issue of the journal RIDE<https://ride.i-d-e.de/>, dedica=
ted to Tools and Environments for Digital Scholarly Editing (DSE).The first issue<https://ride.i-d-e.de/issues/issue-11/> of RIDE dedicated to =
Tools and Environments was published in January 2020. Reviews for the second =
issue will be accepted until the 30st of September 2021.To guide reviewers through the review process and to create a structure for t=
he evaluation, we provide Criteria for Reviewing Digital Tools and Environmen=
ts for DSE that are supposed to be applicable to various types of resources. =
The guidelines (Version 1.0) can be found here<https://www.i-d-e.de/publikati=
onen/weitereschriften/criteria-tools-version-1/>.We kindly ask you to email us before start reviewing a tool at ride-tools (at=
) i-d-e.de<http://i-d-e.de/> with a suggestion of which resource you would li=
ke to review and with a short explanation of your affiliation and area of exp=
ertise. This is important in order to avoid multiple reviews of the same tool.BackgroundIn the introduction to his book Software takes command (Bloomsbury Publishing=
, 2013) Lev Manovich states that =E2=80=9Csoftware has become our interface t=
o the world, to others, to our memory and our imagination=E2=80=9D. Is the sa=
me happening in the world of digital scholarly editing? Certainly we cannot i=
gnore their fundamental role in our daily scholarly practices and in the inte=
ractions with our objects of study. Insofar as tools shape scholarly editions=
, they also shape scholarly editing.A new RIDE issue is devoted to tools for digital scholarly editing. The aim o=
f this issue is to:  *   contribute to the discussion about tooling in Digital Humanities,
  *   bring to the forefront the instruments instead of the final products,
  *   provide a venue for discussing best practices in the development and us=
age of tools,
  *   list useful resources for all those involved in scholarly editing.Beyond that, we hope that the critical examination of digital tools draws gre=
ater attention to the (scholarly) achievements that their creation and mainte=
nance imply.The journal RIDE was founded in 2014 to =E2=80=9Cprovide a forum in which exp=
ert peers criticise and discuss the efforts of digital editors in order to im=
prove current practices and advance future developments=E2=80=9D (RIDE Editor=
ial). RIDE is Open Access, reviews are published as HTML and downloadable as =
TEI. All reviews will be peer reviewed in order to reach a high quality level=
 of the evaluations. The special issue on Digital Tools and Environments for =
DSE will be edited by Anna-Maria Sichani (University of Sussex) and Elena Spa=
dini (University of Lausanne).Submission detailsReviews are accepted in English, French, Italian, and Spanish. The length of =
the review can vary depending on how much the resource offers that is worthy =
of discussion (approximately 2000-5000 words).Please submit your review at ride-tools (at) i-d-e.de<http://i-d-e.de/> as an=
 editable text file (preferably, but not necessarily docx to facilitate the c=
onversion to TEI). Please send illustrations as separate image files (jpg or =
png) and leave a note in the text as a placeholder for each image. In additio=
n to the text, we collect keywords. Each review should be accompanied by a sh=
ort abstract in English, independently of the language used in the main text.For further information please check the general RIDE guidelines for writing =
and submitting<http://ride.i-d-e.de/reviewers/writing-and-submitting/>. The q=
uestionnaire mentioned in the submission checklist has been designed for scho=
larly digital editions so far. We will keep you informed about how to proceed=
 with the questionnaire for this special issue.All reviews will be peer reviewed in order to reach a high quality level of t=
he evaluations. We believe that this is important because the evaluation of d=
igital scholarly resources usually requires a double expertise in digital met=
hods as well as in individual disciplines. This is also to increase the credi=
t for reviews.Suggestions for reviewThe following list is merely alphabetically and not comprehensive:  *   Annotation Studio <http://www.annotationstudio.org/>
