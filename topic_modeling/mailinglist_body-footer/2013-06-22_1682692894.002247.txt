Maybe this is a bit side-tracked, but I would argue with the definition of
data and resource that you give (data most of all). To me data is raw,
primary material, and I am not comfortable considering articles,
monographs, dictionaries or edited texts as data, for instance. They are an
elaborate, secondary material, they are knowledge produced from data, but
not data themselves.
As for resource, to me it can be a simple means to access data or more
elaborate material, but that's not my main definition of a resource. I
would call a resource any coherent set of material, primary or secondary -
for instance to me the Online Froissart is a resource on Froissart's
chronicle; I would also call a resource, to a certain extent, a project
providing users with nifty means of processing a set of data (for instance,
the project preparing the digital edition of Flaubert's "Bouvard et
Pécuchet" put a lot of efforts into building an interface that would let
the user navigate through Flaubert's material for his unfinished novel and
make hypothesis about its potential construction - an interface which is
fully part of the project).
It seems to me that there are more projects aiming at producing resources
rather than data, which can explain why they are so difficult to maintain.
The coherence would be lost if the material was just poured and melted into
a large data repository, or the data would lose most of its interest if
separated from the specific tools created by a project to process it.Maybe this distinction can shed some different light on the issue: curation
of secondary material is a long-established tradition, through libraries,
but curation of data is a different kettle of fish. There are not powerful
pre-existing traditions and models as for secondary material, and the
digital lore has to invent them quickly. As for resources (according to my
definition), their inherent coherence and the often very strong link
between data/material and the interface created to use it means that
maintaining the interface is a often central issue, and one that is
particularly difficult to solve in the long term.Best, Marjorie
