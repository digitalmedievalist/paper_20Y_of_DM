A big amount of important, economically relevant information, is buried 
within the huge mass of multimedia documents that correspond to some 
form of 'narrative' description.Due to the ubiquity of these narrative resources, representing in a 
general, accurate, and effective way their semantic content - i.e., 
their key 'meaning' - is then both conceptually relevant and 
economically important. In this book, we present the main properties of 
NKRL ('Narrative Knowledge Representation Language'), a language 
expressly designed for representing and managing, in a standardised way, 
the 'meaning' of complex multimedia narrative documents. NKRL is also a 
fully implemented environment that exists in two versions: a relational 
database-supported version and a file-oriented one. It constitutes 
probably the most complete and realistic effort realised so far to deal 
with the huge industrial potentialities of the narrative domain.
    
Written from a multidisciplinary perspective, this book not only 
supplies an exhaustive description of NKRL and of the associated 
knowledge representation principles, it also constitutes a source of 
reference for practitioners, researchers and graduates in domains that 
range over narrative theories, linguistics and computational 
linguistics, artificial intelligence, knowledge bases, information 
retrieval, and languages for the ontologies and the semantic web.Contents:- Narratology and NKRL.
