ist, too. I've never used HEML, but it looks neat:Take a look at the Historical Event Markup and Linking Project (http://www.he=
ml.org/). The stated goal of HEML is "to define XML elements that expose and =
outline historical events asserted in documents across the web and to parse a=
nd display these elements in interesting and useful ways." It's a markup syst=
em, not software, and you'd probably have to use some XML editing software to=
 create your HEML documents, rather than any HEML-specific software, but it d=
oes appear to enable linking to digital objects using the <Evidence> element.=
=20HEML is designed to be combined with other markup languages, so if you alread=
y have your information in some form of XML (a TEI list, for example) you can=
 add HEML markup on top of that using the heml: namespace.HEML also requires XSLT and/or SVG for viewing.=20This may be more or less than what you need, but check out the example files.=
 They're pretty cool.Dot-----Original Message-----
