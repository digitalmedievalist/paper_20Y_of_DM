Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts Sponsored Session
at the 50th International Congress on Medieval Studies
Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, May 14-17, 2015We seek proposals for the following session:*Networks of Transmission: Histories and Practices of Collecting Medieval
Manuscripts and Documents*This session will focus on the mapping of those networks of sale and
purchase through which medieval manuscripts have been pursued and on the
collectors and collecting that have catalyzed this transmission across the
centuries. This session =E2=80=93 like The Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts
itself =E2=80=93 is rooted in the belief that studying manuscripts' p=
rovenance can
have dynamic and profound effects not only on our understanding of these
medieval materials as objects to be bought and sold but also on their texts
through mapping their circulation and reception. We particularly welcome
proposals that explore diverse topics from the role of digital technologies
such as the SDBM in conducting provenance research, the relationship
between institutional and private ownership of manuscripts, specific case
studies of collecting practices, the transatlantic travels of medieval
materials, collectors' roles in the dispersal of libraries and the
fragmentation of manuscripts, collectors and manuscript preservation, and
how a manuscript's provenance history can affect its value and
collectability on the rare books market, to how collectors and the act of
collecting can shape and influence interpretations of manuscript evidence.Please send proposals with a one-page abstract and Participant Information
