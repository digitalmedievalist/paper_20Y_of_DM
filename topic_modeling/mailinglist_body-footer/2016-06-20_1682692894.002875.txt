*Reading text with GIS:*
Different digital lenses for Ancient World GeographyTexts and geography have always gone together, with recent focus on 
semantic annotation and extraction of place names from texts. This 
presentation will reflect on how conventional GIS techniques can sit 
alongside close reading. Using an example from the Heritage Gazetteer of 
Cyprus, we will reflect on how GIS methods can be used to interrogate a 
modern text which describes ancient places. A section of the itinerary 
in George Jeffery’s Description of the Historic Monuments of Cyprus 
(1918) will be “remediated” using landscape analysis functions available 
in QuantumGIS. We will conclude with some general reflections on the use 
of GIS methods with textual and other qualitative material.http://digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2016.htmlALL WELCOMEThe seminar will also be screencast on the Digital Classicist YouTube
