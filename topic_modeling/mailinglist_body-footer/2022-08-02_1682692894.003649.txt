CALL FOR PROJECTS<https://tcf.lauramorreale.com/call-for-projects/>Research Cycle 2023-2024Do you have a relatively brief but problematic medieval source or text that e=
xists in multiple copies, but has never received the kind of scholarly attent=
ion it warrants? Are you interested in examining and discussing your chosen s=
ource with a team of highly motivated researchers, who will work for a short =
but intense period to render versions of your source in machine-readable form=
at? Would you like to learn how to use and apply collaborative digital method=
ologies in our increasingly virtual scholarly environment?The newly-established Transcription Challenge Framework (TCF), a scholar-run =
initiative supported by FromThePage<https://fromthepage.com/> and Stanford Un=
iversity Libraries<http://library.stanford.edu/>, is accepting proposals to h=
ost individual Transcription Challenges for its 2023-2024 TCF research-cycle =
season. The most appropriate texts for a Transcription Challenge are relative=
ly short, totalling between 1200 and 2000 lines. Thus, a short book, or a boo=
k section from a longer treatise, are ideal candidates to submit to the Trans=
cription Challenge.For every Challenge, multiple 10-person transcriber teams, led by two captain=
s each, will devote their time and expertise over a two-week period to transc=
ribe one copy of a text or source, in competition with other teams participat=
ing in the Challenge at the same moment. At the end of the Challenge session,=
 several versions of the same source, rendered in machine-readable format, wi=
ll be produced to very high editorial standards, ready for future scholarly u=
se, and will be sent to a panel of subject-area specialist who will judge all=
 the submissions according to the speed, accuracy, and collaborative nature o=
f the transcription effort. Judges will announce a winning submission from am=
ong the participating teams.Two challenges are anticipated, scheduled between January and October 2023. S=
cholars whose proposals are accepted will benefit from the experience gained =
in past transcription events, have access to digital space to support the Cha=
llenge while it is ongoing, and a platform to house and publicize the scholar=
ly output created before, during and after the two-week Challenge period.Past transcription events have proved wildly popular and productive for forme=
r participants, and have provided training and real outcomes within the new r=
esearch environment. For more information on the Transcription Challenge Fram=
ework, its history, goals, and outcomes, please see the TCF Website<https://t=
cf.lauramorreale.com/history-basics-rationale>.To apply, please submit the following by October 1, 2022.  1.  A 200-word abstract of the project that includes the chosen source and =
an explanation of why scholars would benefit from a transcription of its mult=
iple copies;
  2.  A list of digitized copies of the manuscript, preferably in IIIF format=
 (feel free to inquire if this format is unfamiliar to you);
  3.  A statement of who will act as Challenge Coordinator with contact infor=
mation (email address, phone number, institutional affiliation if applicable)=
, and a provisional list of who might serve as team captains;
  4.  All projects that are based on a campus or institution should include, =
when possible, the name of an affiliated Digital Humanities specialist (usual=
ly located in a library or Digital Humanities or Digital Scholarship center) =
who should be informed of the project as it progresses;
  5.  A preliminary bibliography of the source in question (5-10 items).Submissions should be sent by 12 midnight EST on October 1, 2022 to the TCF A=
dvisory Board TCFramework(a)gmail.com<mailto:TCFramework(a)gmail.com>
