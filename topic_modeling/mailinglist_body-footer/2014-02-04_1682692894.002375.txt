        14th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng 2014),                        September 16-19 2014,

Documents are communication artifacts in any form and in any media; they 
can be simple or compound, static or time-varying, private or open. 
Document collections increasingly underpin research, education, 
commerce, entertainment â€“ the full range of human activity. Document 
engineering covers both the innovative use of documents and document 
collections in real-world applications and the study of principles, 
tools and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, 
maintain, share, and productively use these.You are invited to submit original papers to the 14th ACM Symposium on 
Document Engineering (DocEng 2014), to be held at the Hewlett-Packard 
site in Fort Collins, Colorado, USA. Attendees at this international 
forum have interests that span all aspects of document engineering and 
applications. DocEng is sponsored by ACM by means of the ACM SIGWEB 
Special Interest Group. Proceedings are available through the ACM 
Digital Library.
