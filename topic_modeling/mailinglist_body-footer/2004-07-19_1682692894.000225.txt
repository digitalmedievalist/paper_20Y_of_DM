(to say nothing of electronic materials) are horrible over-priced,and 
they are not very well proof read or copy edited, either.  I quit buying 
  UP books about 15 years ago....if I need one, I can find it either in 
my college library or through Inter Library Loan....I hope some day one 
will be able to et CDROMs, DVD,s, whatever, the same way.  My school has 
a contract with Microsoft that allows all faculty, staff, and students 
to get Office for nothing -- why can't we develop the same situation 
with CDs ?
