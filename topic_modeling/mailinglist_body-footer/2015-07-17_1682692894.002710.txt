Marjorie BurghartTHE HENRI PIRENNE INSTITUTE FOR MEDIEVAL STUDIES AT GHENT UNIVERSITY (BELGIUM=
) HAS A POSITION AVAILABLE FOR:
A PhD RESEARCHER (FULL-TIME PREDOCTORAL RESEARCHER)Project description
Collaborative Authorship in Twelfth-Century Latin Literature: A Stylometric A=
pproach to Gender, Synergy and Authority
Stylometry, a subfield of Digital Humanities, offers new methods for segregat=
ing different writing styles. So far, stylometry has been especially popular =
in authorship attribution studies. This project will approach issues of colla=
borative authorship in twelfth-century Latin literature with stylometric meth=
ods.
In the Middle Ages, authors seldom worked alone when conceiving their treatis=
es, letters or narratives. A new text could be the result of drafts on wax ta=
blets copied by professional scribes, of processes of dictation and subsequen=
t correction, etc. An authority like Bernard of Clairvaux, one of the most pr=
olific and influential medieval authors, is known to have been surrounded by =
a team of secretaries. For his sermons and letters in particular, a number of=
 his collaborators were even trained in imitating his writing style, thus fac=
ilitating Bernard's work of final editing or correcting. In the case of the r=
emarkably few medieval female authors known to us, the role of secretaries is=
 even more intricate. Women writers such as the German nun Hildegard of Binge=
n were considered unlearned and incapable of independently writing down their=
 visionary experiences, even if their visions were accepted as being divinely=
 inspired. These women therefore had to be assisted by male collaborators, of=
ten also serving as their spiritual directors. The precise nature and implica=
tions of such (cross-gender) collaborations remain a topic of scholarly debat=
e.
With a number of selected, experimental case studies, concentrating on Bernar=
d of Clairvaux and his secretaries, Hildegard of Bingen and her collaborators=
, Suger of Saint-Denis and his chancery, and Abelard and Heloise, this projec=
t aims to contribute to the debate about individual and collective creativity=
 in the Middle Ages, and to extend the usual application of stylometric metho=
ds to new cultural-historical questions that go beyond mere authorship attrib=
ution.
This research project is funded by the Special Research Fund (BOF) of Ghent U=
niversity.
Directors: Prof. Jeroen Deploige (Ghent University), Dr. Mike Kestemont (Univ=
ersity of Antwerp), Prof. Wim Verbaal (Ghent University)Professional environment
Medieval studies at Ghent University cover a wide range of subjects and metho=
dological approaches. Intensive exchanges within the Henri Pirenne Institute =
for Medieval Studies and with the international academic community create a s=
timulating environment for innovative research. For more information, see htt=
p://www.ugent.be/pirenne
The collaborator will also be associated with the CLiPS Research Centre (Comp=
utational Linguistics & Psycholinguistics) at the University of Antwerp, in o=
rder to be immersed in
the stylometric research carried out at this institute. For more information,=
 see: http://www.clips.ua.ac.be.Qualifications of the candidate
- A Master's degree in History, Literature, (Computational) Linguistics or Me=
dieval Studies. Students who are currently preparing a master's thesi=

ly.
- Excellent study results.
- Experience with reading and analyzing Latin texts, preferably of the mediev=
al period.
- Strong interest in the expanding field of Digital Humanities, and computati=
onal text analysis in particular. Willing to be trained intensively in stylom=
etric research during the course of the PhD project.
- Active knowledge of English and/or French and ability to read scholarly lit=
erature in the major academic languages. Willing to learn basic Dutch during =
the employment at Ghent University (introductory courses are available).
- Commitment to prepare, and finish, a doctoral dissertation as outlined in t=
he project text within four years.
- An intellectually curious, analytical, responsible, and proactive personali=
ty, able to work autonomously as well as in a team.
Offer
- A four-year contract as a full time academic staff member, attached to the =
History Department at Ghent University (scholarship starting from around 1800=
 euro net/month; 1 year + 3 additional years after positive evaluation).
- Opportunity to gain a PhD in four years, supervised by the three project di=
rectors. Given the multidisciplinary nature of the research to be conducted, =
the PhD can be in Literature, Linguistics or History, depending on the prefer=
ence of the candidate and the emphases developed in the research.
- Extensive opportunities for engaging with national and international resear=
ch groups.
- Opportunity to follow an individualized PhD programme at the UGent Doctoral=
 School of Arts, Humanities and Law, including language courses.
Start of the project: negotiable (but between 1 October 2015 and 1 July 2016).How to apply
