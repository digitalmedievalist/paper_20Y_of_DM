Digital and Public Humanities, 6-10 July 2020, organized by the  Venice
Centre for Digital and Public Humanities (VeDPH) at the Department of
Humanities (DSU), Ca' Foscari University of Venice.The Summer School aims at providing advanced and in-depth training in
theories, technologies and methods of Digital and Public Humanities,
focusing on cultural, archeological, historical, literary, and artistic
materials. The school will give the participants the opportunity to engage
in debates about digital and public cultural heritage and humanities
research, while enhancing their competences and skills of digitizing
materials and sources and for modeling, analysing and visualizing
multimedia humanities data. All classes will be taught in English.The VeDPH summer school is divided into four thematic strands:
(1) Digital Textual Scholarship
(2) Digital and Public History
(3) Digital and Public Art History
(4) Digital Archaeology and its PublicThe School is composed by a series of plenary lectures, parallel workshops,
and site visits. Lectures will describe the greater context in which these
theories and methods will be applied: a world in which the work of scholars
is routinely aided by computer-assisted techniques, with both old and novel
problems, challenges and solutions. With a learning-by-doing approach,
participants will reflect every stage of the realisation of a digital
object and on how to make use of the data in own projects. Lessons and labs
will be focused on modeling, retrieving, analysing, visualising, and
publishing data created on relevant sites of the city of Venice (such as
the Biblioteca Marciana, Archivio di Stato, Peggy Guggenheim Collection,
Ghetto) and its surroundings (such as M9 Museum in Mestre, excavations at
Torcello or Altino). Legal questions of intellectual property and
publication licences will be covered, as well as the latest web
developments, such as semantic web and linked open data technologies, in
order to evaluate different data models for cultural heritage objects.Strand #1: Digital Textual Scholarship
This strand focuses on the application of digital methods and technologies
to literary and historical texts and documents, especially from Venetian
archives and libraries. Introductory lessons on theories and best practices
are accompanied by hands-on and laboratory sessions for their immediate
implementation in collaborative project works. Participants are introduced
to theories and best practices of digital scholarly editing. Aspects of
textual materiality (digitisation, formal description and analysis) are
covered as well as methods and standards for the encoding, annotation and
transformation of texts (XML, TEI; XSLT). Finally, the integration into the
semantic web (Linked Open Data, IIIF) will be preformed and tools for the
enrichment, analysis and visualisation of textual data will be applied
(CollateX, Natural Language Processing, Distant Reading). The strand
includes a visit of the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana.Strand #2: Digital and Public History
This strand focuses on the application of digital techniques and a public
approach to the development and presentation of historical research. The
digital aspect revolves around some of the main tools used by digital
historians, such as Text Mining, Network Analysis, and Historical GIS. The
=E2=80=98public' aspect is centred on the issues related to the resea=
rch with the
public and the dissemination beyond the classroom, from public memory to
public sources to public engagement, with specific focus on topics such as
TV, museums, and social media. The theoretical debate and the role played
by digital and public historians in the changing landscape of the
historical discipline are also considered. The strand includes a visit to
M9-Museo del =E2=80=98900 in Mestre, to give the students a concrete example =
of how
the past can be seen and shown through the digital & public lenses.Strand #3: Digital and Public Art History
This strand focuses on the technological development and its cultural
implications which occured in the arts sector over the last decades. In
doing this, the digital aspect is approached both on the side of artistic
production and the art system as well as on the side of museums and art
historical representation. The issues of technological change, digital
nativity, virtual realms and digital tools will be discussed at length and
put in the context of past and recent artistic productions, art
institutions and public sprawl. Both the theoretical debate and practical
tools for digital art historians shall be explored by means of lectures and
labs. The strand includes a visit to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in
Venice to give the students a concrete example of new digital and public
approaches in art institutions.  Eventually, the strand includes the
opening of an art exhibition on the analog-digital relationship by Italian
painter Aldo Sergio expressly organized for the Venice Centre for Digital
and Public History.Strand #4: Digital Archaeology and its Public
This strand focuses on theories and practices that archaeologists apply in
surveys, remote sensing, spatial analysis, data collection, and data
management. Participant will engage in digital strategies to analyze the
heritage and visualize, share and communicate it to the public. They will
approach digital heritage as a virtual tool to explore the mutual
relationship between environment, humans and the past. Using the lagoon
area as test case (Adria, Mira, Torcello, Altino and Caorle), the aim of
the strand is to learn how critically archaeology may be engaged with the
=E2=80=9Cdigital=E2=80=9D. We will work on questions such as =E2=80=9Cwhy, by=
 whom and for what
purpose do we cultivate digital technologies=E2=80=9D. Digital data and publi=
c(s)
are deeply connected, and nowadays archaeologists are not only asked to
build set of coherent digital data from the surveys, but they have to
foster methods for engaging new audiences and facing the global societal
challenges. Digital tools may help the de-colonization of the
archaeological practice, going beyond the mere reconstruction of the past
and being able to detect and analyze the cultural and political frameworks
by which we share and perpetuate the memory.
