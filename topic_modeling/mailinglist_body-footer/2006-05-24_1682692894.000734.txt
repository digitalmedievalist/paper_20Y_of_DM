To: TEI-L(a)listserv.brown.eduRegistration is now open for a three-day workshop on Advanced Text
Encoding and Teaching using TEI P5. The Workshop will be held at Oxford
University Computing Services, from Sept 18th to 20th. See
http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Oxford/2006-09-methNet/ for further details.The Workshop is intended for trainers and advanced users of text
encoding methods in the Arts and Humanities. We will try to combine an
investigation of current training methods with an exposition of the full
range of capabilities now available in TEI P5, with a view to developing
generic training materials which can subsequently be made available via
the AHRC ICT Methods Network, which is sponsoring the event.In addition to the Oxford team (Rahtz, Cummings, and Burnard), the
Workshop will be taught by three internationally known experts in the
domain: Julia Flanders (Brown University); Edward Vanhoutte (Royal
Flemish Academy); Laurent Romary (Max Planck Inst, Berlin).Participation in the workshop is free of charge, but the  number of
places available is strictly limited. Please visit the website at
http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/Oxford/2006-09-methNet/ *now* to register your
interest -- places will be allocated during July.Sebastian Rahtz, James Cummings, and Lou Burnard--
