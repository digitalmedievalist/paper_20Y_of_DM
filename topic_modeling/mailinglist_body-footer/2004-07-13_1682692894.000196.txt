Leeds. Still, maybe I can get some guidance from the group. I'm looking 
for a good XML editor, either cross-platform (e.g. Java) or written for 
Linux/UNIX. I want the usual things: support for both DTDs and Schemas, 
auto-completion of tags and attributes, etc. I don't mind paying if the 
price is not outrageous. But here's the big thing: I've been using 
Emacs/PSGML and jEdit with the XML plugin, and both are good, but both 
require that one use the mouse extensively. I've always hated moving my 
hand back and forth between mouse and keyboard, but lately I've managed 
to acquire a condition (temporary I trust) that makes it painful to use 
the mouse more than a little.So what I'm looking for is an XML editor that can be operated largely 
with the keyboard, with as little mouse input as possible.Suggestions/sharing of experiences most welcome.Peter--===============6989181308894114680==--
