ay be interested in my ongoing online project devoted to reconstructing and s=
tudying the manuscript:http://brokenbooks2.omeka.netOn the site, you will find images and metadata for 94 known leaves of
the manuscript as well as initial findings about the Missal and a link
to a digital surrogate (a test case for the University of St. Louis
Center for Digital Humanities' Broken Books [1]project).Please contact me you have any questions about the project or your
leaf's metadata, or if you know of any leaves of the Missal that I
haven't included. In addition, if your leaf has an OPAC record, please
feel free to send me the PURL so I can include it.Many thanks -Lisa--
