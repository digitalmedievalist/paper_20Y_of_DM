Finally I am around to proposing a paper for Kalamazoo...
I should like to give a paper on 'Fluid, Co-operative and Distributed
ELectronic Editions'.  This would propose a rather different model of
scholarly editing for the electronic medium than in effect so far; some of
the ideas contributing to this can be seen in Where We Are with Electronic
Scholarly Editions, and Where We Want to Be¹  Jahrbuch für
Computerphilologie Online at
http://computerphilologie.uni-muenchen.de/ejournal.html, January 2004, but I
will add a few pieces for this talk.
If you are interested I will work this up with abstract and summary in the
next few days
All the best
