host the 2020 EADH Conference: the new deadline is 20th September 2019.
As with the first EADH conference held in 2018, the second conference will
strengthen the scientific, institutional and cultural relations between the
members of the DH communities in Europe and in the Mediterranean area. The
EADH Conference is organised in each year that the annual ADHO Digital
Humanities conference takes place outside of Europe. We are particularly
interested in proposals from institutions and regions that:•   have recently developed or are developing digital humanities
communities and organizations;•   have not previously hosted an ADHO or the EADH Digital Humanities
conference.Please note that the lead applicant must be a direct member of the EADH or
of one of its Associate Organisations (currently AIUCD, DHD, DHN, CzADH and
DH Russia).OrganisationEADH Conferences are co-organised by two committees:The scientific organisation is conducted by a Programme Committee (PC) with
10 members and one Chair, appointed by the EADH Executive Committee. The
local organiser may appoint up to two members of the PC. The PC decides the
main theme of the conference, identifies and invites keynote speakers,
produces and issues the Call for Papers, manages the review process, and
decides the academic conference programme.Logistical organization will be the responsibility of a Local Organisation
Committee, whose members and chair are appointed by the Local Organisers.The EADH recommends the adoption of the conference management system
ConfTool for registering participants and including them in special events
such as the banquet, but payments may be processed outside ConfTool by the
local organiser if desired.Time Period and VenueConference dates are decided by the Local Organiser, in consultation with
EADH. It is recommended that the conference takes place in the autumn of
2020. Other large DH-related conferences in Europe should be taken into
account when fixing the precise dates.The venue must be an academic or cultural institution in the European area
in its broadest sense (including Russia and countries bordering the
Mediterranean). The hosting institution should be able to accommodate a
minimum of 300 delegates (including plenaries), at least three parallel
sessions, and a communicative poster session.BidsBids should contain a preliminary budget and up to two pages describing the
motivations and logistical opportunities offered by the proposed venue.Bidders must take into account the EADH diversity and inclusivity statement.The venue for the 2020 conference will be decided by the EADH Executive
Committee on the basis of:•   academic and social impact of the conference for the LO;•   logistical adequacy of the venue;•   overall quality of the proposal.Bids should be submitted to secretary(a)eadh.org no later than July, 1, 2019.Structure of the ConferenceThe Conference should be a 2/3-day event, avoiding weekends. Workshops and
training events can precede the official conference days, depending on the
availability of the LO. Presentations will be organized in 90-minute slots.
The conference should have two keynote plenary talks.Typical presentations are:•   full papers for theoretical or highly relevant methodological or
technical issues;•   short papers to present research ideas, approaches and projects;•   panel or roundtable for one relevant topic discussed under different
perspectives by 5/6 presenters;•   posters. One session of the conference is reserved for short poster
presentations.Bidders in coordination with the Programme Committee are encouraged to
propose alternative formats and innovative organization of the conference
in addition to this general framework.BudgetThe conference must be financially self-sustaining, but a backstop funding
from the EADH of up to €5,000 can be discussed. The EADH will also provide
bursaries for young scholars. The local organizers are expected to set six
levels of registration fees:•   faculty and staff with permanent contract, members of the EADH,
associate organizations, and other constituent organizations of ADHO;•   faculty and staff with permanent contract, non-members;•   faculty and staff with fixed-term contract, members of the EADH,
associate organizations, and other constituent organizations of ADHO;•   faculty and staff with fixed-term contract, non-members;•   students, members of the EADH, associate organizations, and other
constituent organizations of ADHO;•   students, non-members.Local Organisers are expected to set member/non-member rates so that the
difference between member/non-member rates are higher than the EADH membership
costs. Registration fees are recommended not to exceed €300 for the highest
level of non-member fees to make the conference more accessible to the
community.Social ProgrammeLocal Organisers are expected to arrange a diverse social programme,
including a social dinner, that can contribute to the EADH community
building.Synergies and Possible SponsorshipSuggested collaborative activities range from hosting of workshops and
tutorials to co-organisation of the conference or financial support.
Private in-kind and financial sponsorship is welcome, provided that any
activity from sponsoring organizations is clearly distinct from, and does
not influence, the academic program.--
