working on a system called teiPublisher, an open-source project to provide 
a repository for XML document collections which allows searching and 
browsing based on eXist queries:<http://teipublisher.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php>Searches in eXist are done through the XQuery language, which is very 
flexible and allows you to do sophisticated searches based on the document 
tree, rather than the kind of simple plain-text searches we're used to from 
Web search tools.Cheers,
Martin
