Conference. The name of the conference is taken from Pennsylvania's
official nickname "The Keystone State," and although we encourage proposals
from within the state we welcome proposals from anywhere, and from any area
of the digital humanities.***Keystone Digital Humanities, a conference at the University of Pennsylvania
with the KeystoneDH InitiativeCALL FOR PRESENTATIONSThe Keystone Digital Humanities conference will be held in the Kislak
Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts at the
University of Pennsylvania Libraries, July 22-24, 2015. Proposals are now
invited for long presentations (20 minutes), short presentations (7
minutes), and project showcases (10 minutes) in all areas of digital
humanities. Presentations may take the form of interactive presentations,
short papers, project demos, or panel discussions. We welcome proposals
from emerging and veteran students, teachers, and scholars. For more
information, visit our conference website at
http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/KeystoneDH/.The community will be invited to vote on proposals that they would like to
see included in the program. The 10 proposals with the highest scores are
guaranteed a slot at the conference. The Program Committee will curate the
remainder of the program in an effort to ensure diversity in program
content and presenters. Community votes will, of course, still weigh
heavily in these decisions.Please send your name, email address, and a proposal of 200-300 words to
keystonedh.conference(a)gmail.com. The proposal deadline is January 2, 2015,
and community peer review will run from January 15-February 15. Proposers
will be notified by March 1.We anticipate that we will have a small number of travel bursaries for
graduate and undergraduate students.Thanks from the Conference Organizing CommitteeDawn Childress, Penn State University
