tific advances and have transformed the ways we can do research. It is claime=
d today that the World Wide Web offers revolutionary models of scientific coo=
peration, which promise to instantiate a utopian democracy of knowledge. This=
 claim has repeatedly been associated with the development and introduction o=
f a collaborative Web, commonly referred to as 'Web 2.0' as well as its offsp=
ring, a semantically enriched Web 3.0 still in the making The aim of this con=
ference is to bring together art historians and other researchers (including =
digital humanists) in order to investigate the intersection between the web a=
nd collaborative research processes, via an examination of electronic media-b=
ased cooperative models in the history of art and beyond.=20
The conference will not only be an occasion to exchange ideas and present rel=
evant projects in the field, but,with contributions spanning from art history=
 (and digital art) to philosophy and cultural studies, from psychology and so=
