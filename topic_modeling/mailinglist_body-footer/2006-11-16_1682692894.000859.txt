the University of Lethbridge:
http://www.uleth.ca/hum/Services/career_fac/English_Academic_Assistant_Novemb=
er_2006_Web_Site.htmI believe these are quite unusual positions and they may be of great
interest to some on this list. They are probationary teaching positions
focusing entirely on English literature. The probationary period is for
two years at which point successful candidates will be given a
continuing (i.e. permanent) contract. The rank is Academic Assistant
(Instructor). The positions are still subject to budgetary approval.We expect the focus of the positions will be junior-level (first and
second year) literary and genre courses. Candidates with a PhD will be
eligible to teach senior level courses in their area of specialisation.
We do not anticipate any composition component (composition is handled
by a different unit), there is no research requirement, and the course
load is 3:3:1 or equivalent. We are willing to consider almost any area
of specialisation. Among the areas where we have senior level courses
open is Middle English. We don't have any Digital Humanities courses at
the moment, though as hosts of the Digital Medievalist, we are active in
the field.What we are looking for in these positions are people who are
enthusiastic and innovative post-secondary teachers. The jobs would be
particularly well suited to PhD holders who love to teach but are less
interested in maintaining an active research program. We will expect the
successful candidates to stay current with contemporary developments in
pedagogy and their discipline.The position is open to all qualified applicants including those without
Canadian citizenship or residency although preference will be given to
Canadian citizens and permanent residents.Application details can be found by following the link above. The
closing date is February 15th, 2007. But please feel free to contact the
chair of the department informally if you'd like to discuss the
positions.The Department Chair is Daniel Paul O'Donnell (i.e. me).--=20
