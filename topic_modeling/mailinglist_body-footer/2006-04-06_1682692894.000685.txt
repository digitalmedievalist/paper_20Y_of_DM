29 June - Saturday 1 July 2006 http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/clip2006/=========================================================== ABOUT CLiP  The international Computers, Literature and Philology (CLiP) conference has
taken place at a variety of European universities since the first conference
in 1998. The initiative for the first seminar was taken by literary scholars
who were not only aware of the importance of new technologies for the
humanities, but also of what the humanities had contributed to the creation
of digital culture in general and to the content of the Internet in
particular. This year the host organization will be the Centre for Computing
in the Humanities (CCH), King's College London, UK. The international Computers, Literature and Philology (CLiP) conference
focuses on the integration of Philology and Information Technology relevant
to humanities computing communities involved in the study of Romance
languages. The academic issues and projects are approached from a
multicultural European perspective, so as to foment international
collaboration in research and teaching. This conference can best be seen as a three-day seminar, in that there are
no parallel sessions, there is as coherent an academic focus as possible and
the participation of young scholars is actively encouraged.   EARLY REGISTRATION DEADLINE    Early registration with reduced fees is open until May 29, 2006. More details and registration form at:
