I've been following this discussion on browser standards 
with interest, but one thought keeps nagging at me.One of the mentioned benefits is this browser or that 
browser's XSLT parser and its standards compliance.  I think 
that we all agree the standard compliance and also the 
promotion of open standards are good things. The little 
nagging thought comes with this discussion of XML transformation 
in the browser.  Who actually requires this of their users?
Many users have extremely out of date browsers which will 
display HTML with (sometimes if you are lucky) a bit of CSS. 
Many don't have browsers that have XSLT parsers built in. 
So it really isn't an issue, to me, because any site I 
design will always try to serve (X)HTML as a bare minimum.[1] 
The transformations of XML to HTML via XSLT may be done 
on the fly, but they certainly won't be done in the user's 
browser.  I don't trust users to have any particular browser.
So if the transformations (with my preference with apache's 
cocoon) are done on the server, then the XSLT parser of the 
browser doesn't really matter to me that much.  Now, it 
is a shame that all browsers don't follow the same standard 
in the same way (esp. with regard to CSS), but I don't see 
that there is much I can do about that, only follow the 
spec. and hope the browsers finally sort things out.[2]-James[1] I hasten to add that I didn't design the Oxford Text 
Archive's website, and that we will be redesigning it to 
be entirely open standards compliant, once we have finished 
totally reorganising the back end and our matching workflow.
[2] Ok, I use Firefox, and yes I could donate time and energy 
to the mozilla project to help it, but I don't really have 
any spare reserves of either.---
