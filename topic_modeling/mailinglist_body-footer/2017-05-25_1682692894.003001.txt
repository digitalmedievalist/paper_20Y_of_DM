This series is focussed on user and reader needs of digital projects or 
resources, and assumed a wide definition of classics including the whole 
ancient world more broadly than only the Greco-Roman Mediterranean. The 
seminars will be pitched at a level suitable for postgraduate students 
or interested colleagues in Archaeology, Classics, Digital Humanities 
and related fields.Digital Classicist London seminar is organized by Gabriel Bodard, Simona 
Stoyanova and Valeria Vitale (ICS) and Simon Mahony and Eleanor Robson 
(UCL).
