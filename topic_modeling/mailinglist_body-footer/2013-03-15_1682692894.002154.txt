(http://petrusplaoul.org) I thought I'd chime.First off thanks to Dot for a thoughtful paper and I really agree that the
distinction between digitized and digital editions is not well understood in
our field and that this misunderstanding lies at the heart of any
resistance. I think it is special impediment to getting scholars to create
digital editions or for that matter do their transcriptions  TEI XML or
really any kind of semantic markup, or to even understand why semantic
mark-up is important.To Godfried: I agree that longevity of the presentation vs. content are two
different issues. However, I think that web-based editions (because of the
web's ubiquity) ensure a level of permanence that editions built on
non-web-platforms  do not achieve.Andrew brings up a number of good points, but I'd like to reiterate his
final point: NONE OF THESE ISSUES ARE INSURMOUNTABLE.I'd be interested to hear reacting to my own attempts to create stable
citations (which I'm still developing, but which is visible on my site). All
changes to every lectio are tracked using GIT (source control) and
particular versions are given a version tag. As the text improves, old
version remain accessible through a drop down list. Simply click on the
earlier version and the older version will appear. (the drop down list also
includes a link to a version log which gives the user a description of the
status of the current version). Thus, a user simply needs to cite the
paragraph number and the version he/she is using (v. 2012.11 etc). Then if
the text changes, a reader can simply select version 2012.11 from the drop
dow list and they will see the exact same version that was used in the
citation. You can see a couple of examples of this here:
http://www.petrusplaoul.org/text/textdisplay.php?flag=dTlecture67 and
http://www.petrusplaoul.org/text/textdisplay.php?flag=prollecture1I generally feel the same way about the point that digital editions are
"miserable" to read. They certainly can be. But they don't have to be, a
clean uncluttered book-like view is easy enough to design and can make
reading very easy and fluid. That's been my goal at least.So those are just of my thoughts.
Sincerely,
jaw
p.s I'm still constantly working on my digital edition, so if you stay long
enough, you'll be sure to find some bugs which I would be happy if you
reported at
