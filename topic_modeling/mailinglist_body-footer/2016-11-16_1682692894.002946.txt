mmons licensing from the Manuscripts of Lichfield Cathedral website: https://=
lichfield.ou.edu . These images include the 9th-century St Chad Gospels and L=
ichfield Cathedral's 15th-century Wycliffe New Testament. I provide t=
wo sizes of images: medium-sized (the size I normally work with) and full-siz=
ed.For the St Chad Gospels, I include additional descriptive information in the =
metadata, such as chapter & verse numbers to facilitate use of the images. I =
will gradually add this information to the images for the Wycliffe New Testam=
ent.Because granting a CC license represents a generosity that exceeds most publi=
cly funded libraries and museums, I include a donate<http://www.lichfield-cat=
hedral.org/donate/donate> link in case anyone would like to express their app=
reciation. Lichfield Cathedral receives no state funding.Finally, I now have the website moved to its new home at the University of Ok=
lahoma. You will notice that the images for download have corrected final adj=
ustments. These images will replace those on the whole website soon.Best,
Bill
