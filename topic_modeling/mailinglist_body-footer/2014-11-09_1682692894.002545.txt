Thanks to the generosity of sponsors and the Moore and Sloan 
foundations, there is significant student funding available.
  FORCE2015 CONFERENCE (12-13 January, Oxford; CFP deadline Nov. 15
  (abstracts); Dec. 1 (posters)).The* FORCE2015 Research Communication and e-Scholarship 
Conference* brings together researchers, scholars, librarians, 
archivists, information scientists, publishers, and research funders in 
a lively forum â€“ to broaden awareness of current efforts across 
disciplines, but also to define the future through discussions, 
challenge projects, demonstrations, and the seeding of new partnerships 
and collaborations. Individually and collectively, we aim to bring about 
a positive change in scholarly communications through both the effective 
use of information technology and a deeper understanding of the nature 
of evolving scholarly practice.The FORCE2015 conference will be held 12-13 January, 2015, at the 
University of Oxford, UK.  On the *preceding day, 11 January 2015, 
*there will be workshops, informal and formal collaborations, and 
business meetings associated with the main conference.There are two themes for abstracts:  * Valuing the diversity of scholarly impact in a networked world
  * Credit where credit is dueThere are also opportunities to propose pre-conference workshops.Force11 (The Future of Research Communication and eScholarship) was 
founded in 2011 to promote research in scholarly and scientific 
communication. It functions as a meeting ground and community of 
interest and practice for researchers across disciplines and sectors who 
are interested in the future of scholarly communication. A highlight of 
the meeting is the "$1k challenge"--a microgrant competition in which 
community groups propose ideas for $1k seed money grants.Although the initial membership of Force11 drew heavily from the natural 
and life sciences, it is now broadly interdisciplinary and inter-sector. 
Its membership includes humanists, social scientists, natural and life 
scientists, librarians, funders, and commercial and non-profit 
publishers and publishing professionals. It is particularly interested 
in expanding its membership in mid- and low-income economic regions and 
in further developing its activities within humanities and social 
science publishing.It is also a very welcoming group. If you or your students have ideas 
for papers or poster on scholarly communication activity, please 
consider submitting an abstract to the conference. Thanks to the 
generosity of our sponsors and the Moore and Sloan foundations, there is 
also significant money available to support student participation.If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!-dan--
