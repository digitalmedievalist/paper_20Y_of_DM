1995 would still be recoverable, if you knew the right software. I=20
recently helped a colleague restore a whole bunch of very old=20
WordPerfect files using Open Office. And while I've not tried a 1995=20
.doc file in it, I'd be amazed if it couldn't read it.My rule of thumb is anything for a PC or Mac is recoverable, no matter=20
how old, unless it is in a minor proprietary format. So most image=20
files, most WordPerfect and Word files, I'm guessing most Wordstar files=20
should be fine. I'd have my doubts about ChiWriter files, though that=20
might have been a pre-PC program for the SuperPet. As a rule, you're=20
better off in recovery with something like OpenOffice, since the stakes=20
surrounding compatibility are much higher for them than for proprietary=20
software like Word: people use Word whether or not it reads other=20

regard to 19th Century paper is also true of things like CD-ROMs and=20
file formats. You'd be amazed how much works just fine.-danOn 10-07-28 05:12 PM, Daniel Mondekar wrote:
