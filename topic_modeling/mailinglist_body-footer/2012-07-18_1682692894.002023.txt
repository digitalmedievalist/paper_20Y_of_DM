2011 on a Mac.I'm switching from a PC to a Mac. On my PC I had COL - Correcteur
Orthographique de Latin installed and working fairly wellI've tried to recreate this on my Mac.I've downloaded the newest release of COL - Correcteur Orthographique de
Latin - Correttore Ortografico di Latino - Corrector Ortogr=C3=A1fico de Lat=

it possible for me to get this working on mac? Has one else done this? Is
there a better solution?Thanks for your help.--=20
