Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThere was a problem overnight with the SourceForge server which I ran 
afoul of when I tried to upload a fix of a bug (which, to tell the 
truth, would have affected two or three nordicists and no one else).The bug is fixed now, the corrected file seems to be getting propagated 
to the mirrors, and Junicode users who wish to upgrade can safely go and 
get their files athttp://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=158636This release may be useful for people who have been waiting for 
additional MUFI characters (the addition of MUFI characters will be 
complete in the next file release). But there are also goodies here for 
people who use OpenType-aware applications (e.g. InDesign, XeTeX, 
Mellel, and to a limited extent MS Word 2003 and later--if you have 
enabled Windows support for International scripts).Users of Mac OS X "Tiger" or later should read the Mac readme.Source code freaks will find the source code posted later today or tomorrow.Peter--===============1805750016705461700==--
