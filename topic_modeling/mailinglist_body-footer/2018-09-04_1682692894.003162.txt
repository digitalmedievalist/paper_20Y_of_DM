Texts=E2=80=9D
at the International Piers Plowman Society Meeting, Miami, April 4=E2=80=936,=
 2019.Detailed information on the conference is available at:
http://www.piersplowman.org/conferences/ipps-2019-conference/******Call for Proposals: Editing Scribal Texts *Organizers: Ian Cornelius, Loyola University (icornelius(a)luc.edu), and Jim
Knowles, North Carolina State University (jrknowle(a)ncsu.edu)Writing in 2001 in a combined review of the last installment of the
Athlone *Piers
Plowman* and the first installment of the *Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*,
Anne Middleton ventured that the salient feature of scribal texts is
neither copying error nor intelligent intervention, but the =E2=80=9Creciproc=
ity of
idiom and knowledge between [an] author and a textual community.=E2=80=9D Mid=
dleton
concluded with what might still, two decades on, be taken as a challenge:
=E2=80=9CThe editorial search for the original text,=E2=80=9D she says, =E2=
=80=9Cis inseparable
from the pursuit of the immediate verbal and institutional conditions that
motivated and informed it, but thus far the latter has surprisingly few
takers.=E2=80=9D            Has this situation changed at all? Much editorial activity in
recent decades has been devoted to presentation of scribal versions of
literary texts; have editors taken up the programmatic focus articulated by
Middleton=E2=80=94namely, to disclose and map the limits of =E2=80=9Creciproc=
ity of idiom
and knowledge=E2=80=9D within textual communities? If yes, how does this ende=
avor
work in practice and what are its most important results? If other research
priorities have emerged, what are they and how are they pursued?            Speakers are invited to explore questions such as the
following: How are the distinctive aims of a documentary edition realized
in its component parts=E2=80=94the introduction, annotations, and critical
apparatus, for example=E2=80=94and how have digital technologies changed the
production, presentation, and use of such editions? How does an edition of
a scribal text negotiate its responsibilities to a scribal document, an
authorial work, and a contemporary readership? What lines of connection
obtain between an edition of a scribal text and the standard/critical
edition of that literary work? Who are the projected readers/users of such
editions, and what do editors supply to them? What is the value of scribal
versions of texts produced at a significant temporal or geographical remove
from the context of composition? Proposed papers need not be devoted to *Piers
Plowman* or to Middle English texts. We welcome proposals concerned more
widely with editorial theory and documentary editing of medieval texts.*Deadline for abstracts is September 7, 2018. *All abstracts should be sent to the conference general mailbox
ippsmiami2019(a)gmail.com rather than to session organizers. If you are
sending your abstract to an Individual Session, please put the name of the
session in the subject line of the email. Abstracts should be no longer
than 300 words and should include the name and email address of the
applicant.--===============4299231599354486015==
