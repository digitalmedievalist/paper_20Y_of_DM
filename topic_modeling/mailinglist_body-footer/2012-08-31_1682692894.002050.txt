refreshing alternative to your everyday Serious Academic Activities.On 8. September starts the reading group focusing on St. Augustine´s
Confessiones. It is hosted by Collegium Volatile, a free study
community. We work online, the course is hosted by Course Sites
(Blacboard).St. Augustine´s Confessiones is said to be the model autobiography, a
source of inspiration for memoir authors through the ages: but it is
also a travel log - a diary of Augustine´s journey into his own mind
and memory, a journey he made in time and space. It has always been a
bestseller. Everyone has read it. Have you? Do you think it´s still
relevant today, after 1600 years? Would it be a model or a
provocation?In this reading group we focus on studying the text in its historical
and philosophical context. Confessiones is our main source. We spend 3
weeks reading the book and studying its historical background. During
the next 5 weeks we focus on particular themes discussed in the book:Confessiones as an Autobiography,
Augustine and his Rome (or rather "Romanitas"),
Love and Friendship,
"Kingdom of Dissimilitude",
Conversion.The group is guided by Dr Emilia Zochowska, PhD in medieval history
(SDU, Odense, 2010), M.A. and Licence in medieval theology (UKSW,
Warsaw, 2005 and 2008).Join us! And if you have any students, friends or colleagues
interested in St. Augustine, please let them know about the course.
