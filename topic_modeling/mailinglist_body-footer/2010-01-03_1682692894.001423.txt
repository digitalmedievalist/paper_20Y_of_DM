same period and the style is quite different, though not unreadable.However the software did not work at all on my browser.  The image on the 
top left matches the transcription, but the square on the main image do not 
match.  I've had this problem on stuff I have done, it is something to do 
with the metric assumed for the image I think.  Until the image itself is 
separable into segments, this will always be a problem.Edward Buckner

Subject: [dm-l] Online paleography exercises created with Image Markup Tool
Dear list,
I'm pleased to announce that Castellanie.net, a website publishing
images and soon transcriptions of the XIIIth century account rolls of
the House of Savoy, now proposes self-corrective online paleography
exercices to help students and beginners to learn how to read those
accounts. Four exercices are available now, with more to come. They can
be accessed from the main website (www.castellanie.net) or directly at
this URL:
http://paleographie.castellanie.netWhat may also be of interest to some of you is that those exercices are
generated directly from Image Markup Tool, thanks to a customized XSL,
CSS and Javascript, making it very easy to create new exercices,
including for scholars with zero web design skills.
I plan to make the XSL / CSS / Javascript available online very soon,
after just a little bit of polishing.
Besides, as we plan to extend the collection of exercices, any feedback
about the interface, functionalities, etc. will be most welcome :)Best regards, an Happy New Year!
