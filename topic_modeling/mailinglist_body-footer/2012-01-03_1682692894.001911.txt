Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Christian,as Martin suggested, ARTFL is a good address to ask questions.You could also start with concordances (get both texts into AntConc, for
example: <http://www.antlab.sci.waseda.ac.jp/antconc_index.html>; the
program is quite user-friendly, once you understand the basics).Another solution would be to install PhiloLogic
(<http://sites.google.com/site/philologic3/home/philologic-3-2-beta-release>)
locally, on your computer. Then put one text in its database, turn another
into a list of words -- and, possibly, bigrams or trigrams - and then
query the database automatically (well, semi-automatically -- it would
take several scripts), sending the list to PhiloLogic.An understanding of regular expressions would also come in handy, but this
is pure joy if you're a linguist or a philologist (this is where I learnt
regexps:
<http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/services/helpsheets/unix/regex.html>).So you would search e. g. for the bigram"arma uirumque"and also for"arm* uir*"Here is what would such searches turn up in the Croatiae auctores Latini
collection:<http://www.ffzg.unizg.hr/klafil/croala/cgi-bin/search3t?dbname=3Dcroala&word=
=3Darma+Uirumque>
<http://www.ffzg.unizg.hr/klafil/croala/cgi-bin/search3t?dbname=3Dcroala&word=
=3Darm*+Uiru*>(PhiloLogic can be tuned for distances between words etc.)Best,NevenNeven Jovanovic
