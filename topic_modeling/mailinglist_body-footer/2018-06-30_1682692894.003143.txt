ycle of Medieval Studies 2019 (June, 3rd-4th).The goal is to offer a broad overview of the current situation of Italian and=
 international medievalist studies. Issues which are related to many differen=
t aspects of the medieval period (V-XV century) can be addressed: history, ph=
ilosophy, politics, literature, art, archeology, material culture, new techno=
logies applied to medieval studies and so on.
