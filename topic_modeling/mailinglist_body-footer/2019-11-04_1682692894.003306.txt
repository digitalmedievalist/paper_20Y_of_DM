hia, the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies (SIMS) at the University=
 of Pennsylvania Libraries is pleased to announce:The 12th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the=
 Digital Age
November 21-23, 2019Hooking UpThe concept of linked open data is the holy grail of the digital humanities. =
Yet the problem of how to link information across platforms has existed since=
 civilization began. As knowledge and learning expanded in pre-modern society=
, the problems associated with collecting, combining, and disseminating infor=
mation inspired new approaches to and technologies for the material text. In =
the internet age, we continue to grapple with the same problems and issues. W=
hile technologies have changed, the questions remain the same.This year's symposium explores the connections between historic and current a=
pproaches to data linkage in regard to manuscripts and manuscript research. H=
ooking Up addresses the topic from a variety of angles and considers how the =
manuscript book operates as a vehicle for information retrieval and dissemina=
tion from the technology of the page and the textual apparatus of a book, to =
the library, and finally, the internet. We will also consider such questions =
as how medieval practices of memory shaped information retrieval and gatherin=
g, how did the technology of the manuscripts book-in all its many forms-facil=
itate or hinder information processing, how can medieval solutions inform mod=
ern technologies, and how do modern technologies illuminate medieval practice=
s? The program will also feature sessions highlighting projects that are adva=
ncing linked data technologies for manuscript researchers, including the T-AP=
 Digging Into Data Challenge project Mapping Manuscript Migrations<http://map=
pingmanuscriptmigrations.org/>.For more information and to register, go to http://www.library.upenn.edu/abou=
