assist my research by giving me more time to do it.I've been tapped to do the course scheduling for next year. For some 
reason that isn't 100% clear to me yet, everybody that does this says it 
is awful and time consuming. So I was wondering if there might be free 
and easy software for this.Does anybody know of good scheduling software that could be used in such 
circumstances?-dan
