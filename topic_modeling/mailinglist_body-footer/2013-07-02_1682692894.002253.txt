BENJAMIN ALBRITTONBenjamin Albritton works as the digital medieval program manager at
Stanford University Libraries. In that role, he oversees the Parker on the
Web project (<http://parker.stanford.edu>), the preservation of Walters Art
Museum digital manuscript content in the Stanford Digital Repository (<
goo.gl/GvCba>), and ongoing content collaborations with the Bibliothéque
nationale de France, the University of Pennsylvania, and others.In addition to content-based projects, he coordinates the Mellon-funded
Digital Manuscript Technology program: an international manuscript
interoperability project dedicated to cross-repository collaboration. This
effort, shared by many collaborators, has spawned SharedCanvas (<
http://www.shared-canvas.org/>) and the International Image
Interoperability Framework (<http://lib.stanford.edu/iiif>). The primary
aim of the project is increased access to distributed resources and tools
for medieval scholars in order to enable comparative work across manuscript
collections.Benjamin is committed to bringing content owners, software developers, and
scholars together to further research in medieval topics. In addition to
his digital library work, he remains active as a musicologist.  Current
projects include: "Machaut in the Book" (co-PI), an interdisciplinary and
collaborative study of the role of Guillaume de Machaut as author in the
surviving witnesses to his works, with particular focus on poetic
miscellanies; and "A Comparative Kalendar", a nascent tool for navigation
across digitized manuscripts that contain liturgical calendars.

SUZANNE PAULSuzanne Paul is the Medieval Manuscripts Specialist at Cambridge University
Library (<http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/>). She is currently developing a new
online catalogue of the library's medieval manuscripts using TEI and
participating in the ongoing digitisation of the collection in the
Cambridge Digital Library (<http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/>). From 2007 to May
2013 she was sub-librarian at the Parker Library (<
http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/about-us/parker-library/>), Corpus Christi
College, Cambridge, with particular responsibility for creating and
updating metadata in XML and database formats for Parker on the Web (<
http://parkerweb.stanford.edu/>). She has extensive experience of
collaborating with researchers and other librarians on digital projects.*****************************
PHILIP SHAWI am a medievalist with around ten years' experience in digital humanities.
My first academic post was on the Partonopeus de Blois Electronic Edition
Project (<http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/partonopeus/>), where I worried about
the textual difficulties of an Old French romance alongside straightening
out the project's automated text processing needs. Since then I've
developed a tool for gathering linguistic data from Twitter, used by Ruth
Page in her _Stories and Social Media: Identities and Interaction_
(Routledge, 2012), have created tools for generating the indices of the
Production and Use of English Manuscripts 1060-1220 project (<
http://www.le.ac.uk/ee/em1060to1220/>), and was part of the team
responsible for HALOGEN (<http://halogen.le.ac.uk>). I am currently working
on software tools for comparison across Middle English texts with divergent
orthographic forms and on the application of cluster analysis to historical
onomastic data. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to the
running of Digital Medievalist as an Executive Board member.*****************************
PETER STOKESI am currently Senior Lecturer in the Department of Digital Humanities at
King's College London. I have a degree in Classics and English Literature
and another in Computer Engineering, as well as a PhD in Anglo-Saxon
palaeography. I have worked as Research Associate, Analyst and/or Developer
on the LangScape (<http://langscape.org.uk/>), Anglo-Saxon Cluster (<
http://ascluster.org/>), and Electronic Sawyer (<http://esawyer.org.uk/>)
projects at King's. I have also held a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship
on computer-based methods in palaeography, and was awarded a major research
grant for DigiPal (<http://digipal.eu/>), which I lead as Principal
Investigator. I lecture in Digital Humanities and in palaeography, I advise
on external digital projects, and I am Principal Coordinator of Medieval
Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age (MMSDA; <
http://www.ies.sas.ac.uk/study-training/research-training-courses/medieval-ma=
nuscripts-digital-age>),
a five-day training programme for PhD students.A full CV is available at <http://peterstokes.org/cv/>.I have served on the Executive Board of Digital Medievalist and been
Associate Editor of the Journal since 2009, and I have been Director of DM
since 2012. In addition to these roles I have contributed to DM in many
other ways, including updates, improvements and emergency fixes to the
website; running conference sessions; helping introduce term limits for the
Board; and co-acting as Returning Officer for the 2010 elections. DM's
membership has grown significantly during this time, increasing by more
than 15% in the last year, so if re-elected my key goal will be to
establish the expertise and infrastructural stability necessary to allow
this growth to continue in the longer term.*****************************
DOMINIQUE STUTZMANStutzman, Dominique (2011-2013). After degrees in Classics, History and
German studies at the Sorbonne, Dominique Stutzmann studied at the =C3=89cole
nationale des Chartes (<http://www.enc.sorbonne.fr/>; archiviste
pal=C3=A9ographe, 2002), received a MLIS and worked at the Staatsbibliothek zu
Berlin (MSS Dept.) and the Bibliothéque nationale de France (<
http://www.bnf.fr/fr/acc/x.accueil.html>; Digital Information Dept.). He
completed a PhD on scribal practices of Cistercian communities in medieval
Burgundy, for which he developed the statistical analysis of scribal
profiles based on TEI encoding. Since 2007, he is lecturer of medieval
paleography at the =C3=89cole Pratique des Hautes =C3=89tudes (<
http://www.ephe.sorbonne.fr/>) and, since 2010, research fellow at the
Institut de Recherche et d'Histoire des Textes (<http://www.irht.cnrs.fr/>;
CNRS). In the Graphem project (<http://liris.cnrs.fr/graphem/>; 2008-2011),
he co-organized an international colloquium on computer-aided script
analysis, categorization and classification (Paris, 14-15 April 2011). He
is now principal investigator of the ORIFLAMMS project (<
http://oriflamms.hypotheses.org/>; 2013-2016), joining Computer Vision,
Linguistics and Palaeography (allographic transcriptions, ontology of
forms) in study of the variety of medieval scripts and its factors (place,
time, language, formality, function).*****************************
SEAN SWANICKMy name is Sean Swanick and I am the Islamic Studies Liaison Librarian at
McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. Since starting in 2009, I have,
amongst my other duties of collection development, reference work and
teaching, and related activities curated a number of exhibitions
highlighting McGill's rich manuscript collection. Noteworthy for the
members of Digital Medievalist are the 2012 exhibition "Book Culture in the
Medieval Mediterranean World" (co-curated with Dr. C. Hilsdale of the Art
History department and Ms. J. Garland of Rare Books and Special
Collections, McGill), the Shahnmeh exhibition of the famous Persian epic
poem which was also an online exhibition (<
http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/shahnameh/index.php>) and the Ab=C5=AB H=C4=
=81mid
al-Ghaz=C4=81l=C4=AB (1058-1111) exhibition and accompanying booklet. Through=
 these
efforts, I strive to combine research exercises with professors and
students in order to highlight the rich collections of McGill University.
In addition, I have co-curated an Islamic Calligraphy exhibition in 2010
which was later digitized (<
http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/islamic_calligraphy/index.php>).If elected, I will serve the community in engaging in scholarly activities
and leading and ensuring that the overall direction of the organisation and
the Digital Medievalist's many projects and programmes remain a priority
and continue to flourish.*****************************--===============3429701439009016382==
