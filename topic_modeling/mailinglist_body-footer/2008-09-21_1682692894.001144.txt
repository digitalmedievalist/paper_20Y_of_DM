a panel for the Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies 
conference in Tempe, AZ, 12-14 February 2009While digital media have enabled new and innovative access to medieval 
and Renaissance texts, these same media hold perhaps even more potential 
for investigating and representing the material cultures of these 
periods. This panel of papers will build on recent scholarship on 
materiality by bringing together innovative research on the theory and 
praxis of digitizing medieval and Renaissance material culture. 
especially as it relates to the senses. Topics may address theory and/or 
practice in the application of digital technology to the study of 
material culture, including but not limited to art, architecture, 
cartography, the anatomical and cultural body, collections, 
antiquarianism and early archeology, dramaturgy, arts and crafts, 
printed and manuscript materials.  Accepted papers may also be 
considered for a collection of essays on "Digitizing Medieval and Early 
Modern Material Culture" to be edited by Brent Nelson (University of 
Saskatchewan) and Melissa Terras (University College London) for the New 
Technologies in Medieval and Renaissance Studies series edited by Ray 
Siemens and Bill Bowen.Please submit title, brief abstract, and statement of affiliation to 
brent.nelson_at_usask.ca by October 14, 2008.Conference website:
