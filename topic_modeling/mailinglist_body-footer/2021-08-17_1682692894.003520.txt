UK/IE Digital Humanities Network event
22 October 2021
Who has Access to the Digital Humanities? Diversity and  Inclusivity in DH in=
 Ireland and the UK
The convenors of an AHRC/IRC funded project to undertake research and consult=
ation towards the implementation of a permanent Digital Humanities associatio=
n for the UK and Ireland (see list of team members here<https://dhnetwork.org=
/team/>) invite submissions from individuals to co-create an event relating t=
o DH and inclusion.
One of the dreams of information and communication technologies is that of eq=
uitable and open access to information, to services, and to opportunities. We=
 know, of course, that this is only true on the surface, and that technologic=
al systems tend to recreate the inequities of the cultures and societies that=
 build them.As such, the dream of the digital humanities as a =E2=80=98big te=
nt' (that is, capacious, broad and inclusive) is also one that we nee=
d to constantly query and challenge if the field is to have a claim to being =
inclusive and diverse.
This is a particularly pressing issue as we explore the potential for a regio=
nal DH network to support the use and promotion of DH methods in the UK and I=
reland. We would therefore like to ask our growing community to co-create an =
event on the state of inclusivity in DH in our countries, and how we might ac=
tively strive to improve from this baseline. This virtual event will take pla=
ce on 22nd October, 2021, from 10AM-4PM.
Themes welcomed: Access barriers come in many forms, and the only way to addr=
ess them is to surface and discuss them. For this reason, the programme commi=
ttee welcomes submissions addressing the broadest possible interpretation of =
disinclusion, based on ageism, racism, classism, sexism or ableism; geography=
, culture, or ethnicity; hidden behind the availability or accessibility of d=
ata, funding, software, infrastructures, or the languages we use; manifesting=
 as closed opportunities, labour or reward inequities, or well-meaning inclus=
ivity measures that trivialise or tokenise certain kinds of experience.  In p=
articular, we welcome submissions that point not only toward the problems, bu=
t profile good practice examples and measures we might take as a network..
Perspectives welcomed:  This call is for students, early career researchers, =
activists, community workers, or any who do or would engage in DH/online prac=
tices, methodologies and spaces etc., and who have an interest in shared prac=
tice, open exchange, or to showcase their work. Submissions may therefore be =
from individuals, teams or pairs of collaborators having experienced successf=
ul or failed attempts to be a part of the DH community, representative groups=
 from different sectors, or other configuration. We would particularly like t=
o encourage non-academic contributions, and indeed those representing the voi=
ces of people who would like to access DH but who cannot for different reason=
s. As we are a UK/Irish network, however, we will highlight experiences eithe=
r tied to the specificities of this geographical space, or offering reflectio=
ns relevant to our future development.
Format: The programme committee encourages potential participants to propose =
a form to follow their function. From a 5-minute provocation to a full 45-min=
ute panel session; prerecorded or live; based on personal experiences or rese=
arch.  In your submission, please let us know as well if there are any measur=
es you would like us to take to ensure you feel you will be able to present i=
n a safe and welcoming environment of listening, learning and discussion.
Submissions: Please submit via this form<https://forms.office.com/r/MzYriiJ2D=
K> a description of up to 250 words of how you would like to contribute along=
 with a bio note of up to 50 words by 5PM on 13 September, 2021.The programme=
 committee will meet to consider the proposals, and convene a meeting for all=
 participants to discuss issues of format and ground rules in the first week =
of October.--
