because I expect folks on this list might have some suggestions for
scientific developments. I'm not sure if Bob is on DM so I'm cc:ing
him on this, in reply please make sure that you "reply all" so he
receives suggestions too.My own suggestion is the Archimedes Palimpsest project website
(http://www.archimedespalimpsest.org/). The palimpsest is from a
ninth-century manuscript and many different techniques were used to
bring out the text.There's also interesting work happening in digital approaches to
palaeography and codicology (both in classics and in medieval
studies). A recent conference, Kodikologie und Paläographie im
Digitalen Zeitalter — Codicology and Palaeography in the Digital Age,
organized by the Institute of Documentology and Scholarly Editing
(IDE) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München had as its output (or
input, more properly) a collection of essays on the topic, but I'm not
sure if the collection is available online (Malte, can you say a bit
more?).The Digital Medievalist journal has published a few articles on
digital approaches to palaeography, and also illustrations on how
technologies can be used for research. See:Peter A. Stokes, "Palaeography and Image-Processing: Some Solutions
and Problems" DM 3 (2007-2008)
http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/3/stokes/
Arianna Ciula, "Digital palaeography: using the digital representation
of medieval script to support palaeographic analysis" DM 1.1 (Spring
2005) http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/1.1/ciula/
Kevin Kiernan, "The source of the Napier fragment of Alfred's
Boethius" DM 1.1 (Spring 2005)
http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/1.1/kiernan/For catalogues and cataloguing projects, see the ENRICH project
(enrich.manuscriptorium.eu), a project to create a European-wide
manuscripts catalogue (using the TEI manuscript description schema).
Others on this list can say more about it than I can.I'll copy this onto the MedTextL as well.Dot

Subject: [MEDTEXTL] beyond besic codicology
To: MEDTEXTL(a)listserv.illinois.edu
I am working on the section of the Any Holt Library which will be
similar to what I have done with incunabula. This will be for medieval
manuscripts. The first page will feature how scholars deal with
manuscripts: paleography and codicology, pecia and other procedures in
medieval scriptoria. I am interested in recent scientific
developments: techniques for identifying and examining a palimpsest,
what DNA analysis id doing for manuscript study. Where do I go to find
online material for these? I will include a page on catalogs and
cataloging projects, and I will include the work I have already done
withCONSULTING MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS
