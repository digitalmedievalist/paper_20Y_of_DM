Association of rchaeologists Meeting) in Barcelona, Spain September 5-8. I
am co-chairing a session (#254) entitled, "Mobility and Culture Change
during Transitional Periods in and around the Alpine Region." Please see
the abstract below and submit by February 15th at:
https://www.e-a-a.org/eaa2018
*Abstract (Session 254)*
Transitional periods, often accompanying the migrations of people and/or
cultures to an area, are times of significant socio-cultural change as
evidenced in the archaeological record. These periods are particularly
important to study, as they can provide context and understanding to the
resulting assimilation, colonization, and ethnogenesis of populations. We
aim to discuss how the migration of people during key transitional periods
in the history of the Alpine region altered the social, economic, and
political landscapes as evidenced by human and animal remains as well as
material culture. We are interested in papers dealing with various
transitional periods, for example, from the Mesolithic to Neolithic, Copper
Age to Bronze Age, Bronze Age to Iron Age, Pre-Roman to Roman Period, and
Late Roman to Early Medieval Period. Although there are multiple
methodological approaches to answering questions related to migration and
socio-economic change, this session will focus on the use of archaeological
science, including biochemical analyses of human and faunal remains, i.e.
stable isotopes, ancient DNA analysis, and provenience studies on material
remains to discuss these transitional periods in the archaeological record.We invite scholars to present papers with a geographic focus in and around
the Alpine region, including Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria,
Slovenia, and Monaco who are studying (1) the impact of migration on
social, economic, or political environments during key transitional
periods, and (2) employing archaeological science methodologies.--
