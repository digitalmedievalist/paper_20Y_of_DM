imaging but also with Photoshop (or the GIMP); it's fairly easy if the=20
two layers of ink are sufficiently different, otherwise it's much more=20
complicated. There's a discussion of some techniques using Photoshop by=20
Julia Craig-McFeely in Vol 4 of our own DM Journal=20
(http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/3/mcfeely; see the section=20
'Digital Restoration'): she focusses on damaged manuscripts but the=20
principles are much the same. I did similar work myself using Photoshop=20
and no special imaging for the Rinascimento Virtuale project that=20
Francesco Stella mentioned, so I'm happy to discuss it further and am=20
also happy to look at some sample images if you want to send them to me=20
off-list.I also have a forthcoming article on the topic and some prototype=20
software which tries to simplify the process; again, contact me if=20
you're interested.Peter--=20
