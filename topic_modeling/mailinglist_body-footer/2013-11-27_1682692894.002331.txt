Centre for e-Research Seminar Series*
The Centre for e-Research (CeRch) at King's College London runs an 
interdisciplinary seminar programme on alternate Tuesday evenings during 
term time.With viewpoints from many disciplines including the sciences, social 
sciences and humanities, the series' primary focus is to stimulate 
discussion and provide new and innovative insight into design, 
development and use of digitally-based methods and technologies, and the 
theoretical issues that they raise (especially where they interact with 
a range of other fields).Previous topics have included visualisation, webometrics, digital 
research infrastructures, computational creativity, motion data, 
computational linguistics, cultural value and social network analysis, 
among many others. Details of recent seminars in this series can be seen at
http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/cerch/research/seminars/ .The series invites contributions for talks engaging with innovative 
questions or applications, using technology-enhanced methods. The series 
provides excellent networking opportunities, and will be of interest to 
anyone interested in debates around theories and practice in computing 
and digital technologies.Seminars are held fortnightly on Tuesdays during term time at 6.15pm 
(unless otherwise stated) in the Anatomy Museum Space, at King's College 
London, Strand Campus 
(http://www.kcl.ac.uk/cultural/spaces/anatomy-museum.aspx).Seminars are followed by drinks and nibbles.Twitter: @KingsCeRch     hashtag: #cerchseminars---
