software I have used some years ago now for comparing string of poems 
(it was good at the job I needed it for and it may have improved, but I 
am afraid I don't know how much and if it is enough for what you need to 
do): http://donnevariorum.tamu.edu/resources/down/downpage.htmlTUSTEP is also a famous tool for producing high standard collations 
ready for publication, as you may know already, but may be too ambitious 
for your task: http://www.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de/tustep/tustep_eng.htmlLet us know your findings,
