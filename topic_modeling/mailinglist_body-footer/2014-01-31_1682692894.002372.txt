recognition of talent and expertise in the digital humanities community and
are nominated and voted for entirely by the public. These awards are
intended to help put interesting DH resources in the spotlight and engage
DH users (and general public) in the work of the community. Awards are not
specific to geography, language, conference, organization or field of
humanities that they benefit. There is no financial prize associated with
these community awards. There were many nominations and the international
nominations committee (http://dhawards.org/dhawards2013/committee/)
reviewed each nomination. We're sorry if your nomination was not included,
all decisions are final once voting opens. Please see
http://dhawards.org/dhawards2013/faqs2013/ for this and other frequently
asked questions.Anyone is allowed to vote, yes anyone, but please only vote once.Please cast vote by looking at the nominations and following the link to
voting form at http://dhawards.org/dhawards2013/voting/ before midnight
(GMT) on Friday 14 February 2013 when voting will be closed.Good luck!james(a)dhawards.org--
