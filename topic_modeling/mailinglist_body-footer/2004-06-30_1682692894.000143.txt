person's markup, which they considered to be objective and transparent, in 
the future becomes a text which is the subject of someone else's markup. We 
could envisage a time when early markup projects become the subject of 
scholarly investigation, and both their source markup and their various 
textual renderings (medialisations?) are themselves marked up. Re-reading 
my own comment "The markup merely strives after completeness and 
transparency", I guess that's a pretty big "merely".Cheers,
Martin
