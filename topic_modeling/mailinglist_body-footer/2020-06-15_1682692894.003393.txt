Online seminar, streamed live and archived at: https://youtu.be/cG8sRps1s6QOur paper investigates the evolution of the concept of =E2=80=9Cownership=E2=
=80=9D in Roman law using computational semantic methods. The work is based o=
n a relational database of Justinian's Digest (533 CE) arranging more=
 than twenty thousand text units excerpted from hundreds of otherwise lost le=
gal works in a Python environment and shared on GitHub (mribary/pyDigest). We=
 present a thematic tree-map of Roman law based on hierarchical clustering of=
 sections. We use computational methods for terminology extraction and distri=
butional semantic word representations to show how the semantic landscape ass=
ociated with =E2=80=9Cownership=E2=80=9D changed over time.ALL WELCOME
