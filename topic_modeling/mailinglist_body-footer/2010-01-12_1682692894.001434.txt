Yes, Image Markup Tool is a very helpful tool; I use it too in another 
unrelated project, to prepare interactive archtectural plans of 
romasnesque churches associates with a photo gallery, and it works like 
a charm. Since the source annotation file is in TEI XML format, IMT is 
very flexible, and with a good XSL one can make pretty much anything of it.
