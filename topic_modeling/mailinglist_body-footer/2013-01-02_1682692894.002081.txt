d Cathedral's St Chad Gospels (8th century) and Wycliffe New Testament (~1410=
) available online: http://lichfield.as.uky.edu. I used a monochrome camera f=
or the imaging, taking at least twelve different spectral bands for each page=
. I've designed the website to allow for the overlay of any two images within=
 a page's image set, including RGB. I have a slide bar to allow for the adjus=
tment of the top image's transparency to help sort out hard to discern detail=
s.Best,
Bill--
