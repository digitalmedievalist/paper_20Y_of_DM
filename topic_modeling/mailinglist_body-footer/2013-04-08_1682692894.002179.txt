conference, to be held in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, from 11-13
July 2013.  This conference comes at a critical inflection point in the
transformation of scholarly editing caused by the two massive shifts of
the digital revolution: the movement of all data into digital form and
the creation of new modes of collaboration. For the first: the creation
of massive amounts of data in digital form has already transformed the
basic materials of scholarly editing, while digital tools offer new
methods for exploration and publication. For the second: where scholarly
editing in the past has been typically the work of a single dedicated
scholar, the development of social media opens up the possibilities of
collaborative work across whole communities. These changes affect every
aspect of scholarly editing. This conference will explore the
theoretical, practical, and social implications of these changes.Proposers accepted from this open call will join some thirty invited
conference participants, drawn from scholarly editing, digital
humanities, and the 'citizen scholar' movement.  Confirmed participants
are Barbara Bordalejo, Susan Brown, Ben Brumfield, Gabriel Egan, Paul
Eggert, Paul Flemons, Alex Gil, James Ginther, Tuomas Heikkil√§, Fotis
Jannidis, Laura Mandell, Murray McGillivray, Brent Nelson, Catherine
Nygren, Dan O'Donnell, Roger Osbourne, Wendy Phillips-Rodriguez, Elena
Pierazzo, Ken Price, Peter Robinson, Geoffrey Rockwell, Peter
Shillingsburg, Ray Siemens, Michael Eberle-Sinatra, Joshua Sosin,
Melissa Terras, Edward Vanhoutte, and Joris van Zundert (to be
confirmed: Hans Gabler and Jerome McGann). The conference will be
preceded by a one-day workshop on collaborative editing systems.Proposals should focus on some aspect of contemporary digital scholarly
editing. We welcome descriptions of current projects, theoretical or
speculative discussions, bibliographic work, or any aspect of scholarly
digital editing. Papers considering scholarly editing in a communal,
collaborative context are particularly encouraged. Proposals will be
accepted under two strands: one for students of graduate and doctoral
programs, one for all others.  We particularly welcome proposals from
the GO::DH <http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/> (Global Outlook::Digital
Humanities) community, addressing digital scholarly editing in a global
context.  We will able to offer financial support for accepted
proposals, if needed, in the form of bursaries and/or funding for all
travel and other costs, and will give preference in allocating funding
to proposers from circumstances where support is rarely or never
available. As well as a 500 word abstract, proposers should submit a
cover letter explaining their interest in the conference theme, why they
want to attend and indicate what level of support (if any) they might
need to come to the conference.Proposal submission will close on 26 April; successful proposers will be
notified by 10 May 2013. The call is
athttps://ocs.usask.ca/conf/index.php/sdse/sdse13/schedConf/cfp.; the
conference website is at https://ocs.usask.ca/conf/index.php/sdse/sdse13.
