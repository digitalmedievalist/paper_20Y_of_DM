DAMOS - Database of Mycenaean at OsloDĀMOS is an annotated corpus of all the published Mycenaean texts, 
allowing for a corpus linguistics approach to the study of the earliest 
attested Greek dialect. Text files, reproducing the most updated 
editions of the texts, have been imported into a relational database 
(MySql) and are now being annotated for morphology, syntax and lexical 
information. Noteworthy is that DĀMOS allows for storing multiple, 
competing analyses of a given linguistic unity (e.g. a word). A rich set 
of metadata, including – automatically imported – detailed epigraphical 
information, is also available for searches and can, thus, be crossed 
with linguistic data. Online edition: https://www2.hf.uio.no/damosALL WELCOMEThe seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments. For more
