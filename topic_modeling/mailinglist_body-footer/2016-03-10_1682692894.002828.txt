hosting multispectral imaging workshops at the 51st International Congress
on Medieval Studies at Kalamazoo on techniques for digital manuscript
recovery. The Lazarus Project is a multispectral imaging initiative that
works with imaging specialists from around the world. We have recently
worked on projects at Chartres, Vercelli, the National Library of Wales,
and the Beinecke Library. If you are interested in participating in either
an imaging or processing workshop, please sign up here
