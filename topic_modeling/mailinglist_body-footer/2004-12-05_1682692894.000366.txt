thought on the fate of the Roman world in the context of Roman and barbarian =relations. As in the past, we will bring together scholars who represent=20
different methodological, disciplinary, geographical, and chronological=20
perspectives. Contributions will deal with topics related to (1) The=20
creation/evolution of barbarian and/or Roman identity; (2) The nature of the =interaction between the Roman and barbarian cultural worlds (e.g. language,=20
literature, religion, material culture); (3) The interpretation of the=20
evidence of both literature and material culture; (4) Issues of=20
continuity/change with regard to social, political, and religious=20
institutions; (5) the historiography of perceptions of Romans and barbarians =and its significance for the modern world; and (6) Theoretical models that=20
help to interpret the nature of barbarian-Roman interactions.
