discovered Love in the 13th century”. Such a statement might be daring to
anyone not familiar with medieval literature, but here you will be able to
check that it isn’t completely false. But what about Catullus or Ovid? What
about Platon and Sappho? And besides, do you believe, like Rougemont, that
“happy love has no history in Western Literature”? Do you think that the
myth of Love in Europe is that of an unfulfilled and adulterous Passion? Do
we only have stories of fatal Love? Can we find the seed of the current
love stories in the so-called “birth of Love” of the 11th century?In our course we will not only study medieval texts in historical and
philosophical context, but also compare them to other works of literature,
cinema, essays, music, etc.Read more at: http://collegiumvolatile.com/?page_id=235Students are expected to read all the required texts and presentations
(Powerpoint with voice comments) and take active part in all discussions on
chat and forum at least twice a week (the schedule for these virtual
meetings will be set by everyone once the course will be started). Every
week a Powerpoint presentation will give instructions for the assignments
as well as introduce all the required and optional texts for the week.The assignments will consist of writing a classical report of at least, 600
words related to the topic dealt during the week.Workload: max. 3-4 hours per week.Sergi Sancho Fibla, researcher of the Department of Humanities in
