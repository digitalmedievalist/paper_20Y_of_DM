Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitKindle locations are assigned automatically and they correspond to a  
predetermined number of characters. A particular word in a particular  
book, has a particular location independently of the font size (I just  
checked this). I only have one of my Kindles here, so I cannot check  
the consistency from system to system, but I suspect (and hope) that  
this would not vary. Locations vary, however, depending on the edition  
(in the same way that printed books have passages in different pages  
in different editions).
A full bibliographic entry with the Kindle location should be enough  
for referencing purposes.BB
