Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear all,Following my earlier e-mail, full details of the proposed changes to the Byel=
aws are now available at <http://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com/2014/05/21/=
proposed-change-to-byelaws/>, and the relevant sections are reproduced below =
for your reference. As mentioned, any comments on the wording of the Byelaws =
should be received before the next meeting of the Board on 2 June 2014 by 3pm=
 GMT.Even if we do retain the wiki, the opinion of the Board is that the Byelaws s=
hould still change, as we think it is not best practice to codify any single =
technology into a governance document like this. For that reason I'm hoping t=
o keep the discussion of the Byelaws separate from that of the infrastructure=
, if that's possible, so I'll reply to the infrastructure thread shortly.All the best,Peter
