typed in your passage and then could ask for any distance between 
blanks, at what point in the text the Cloze stuff began, whether or not 
hints were given, and in what form, scored the thing and did some 
statistics with the class responses.  And the whole thing interacted 
with stats and scores from a "guess the next letter" thing that used 
Shannon-Weaver stuff to plot the chances of the next letter being 
guessed, and with another exercise that used Osgood semantic 
diferentials,and I plotted the whole thing's scores in polar and in 
regular graphs...Sigh, them were the very old days.  (And no one gave me 
any funds to do it - in fact,the administration was annoyed to see a 
Humanities faculty member messing about with computers)
