Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableThe addition of standardized location markers sounds pretty great, but
getting everyone to do it (or to follow any given standard) seems
pretty optimistic--especially retroactively.In the end, don't we use search queries to find text these days? It's
particularly easy if the text is a word-for-word quotation (you can
even misspell it). That's not to say that it's enough to satisfy
academic purposes to simply write "Bible" or "Shakespeare" in your
footnote and let the reader google the quote to figure out which book,
chapter, verse, play, etc. A good footnote also provides contextual
information--sometimes it matters to know which editor, year of
publication, etc.But if you're only worried about being able to locate the passage of
an electronic text, mark-up is slow, search is fast.Jesse HurlbutOn Thu, Oct 7, 2010 at 6:55 AM, Welzenbach, Rebecca <rwelzenb(a)umich.edu> wr=
