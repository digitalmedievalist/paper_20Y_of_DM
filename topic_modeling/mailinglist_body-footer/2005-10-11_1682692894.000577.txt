accessible. For now, I'm going to go the HTML route with that nifty little 
search box. I have also talked to Roy Liuzza about the OEN Bibliography, 
and that database took a few years out of his life. I'd love to do 
something like that, but will have to learn MySQL first, and a bunch of 
other things.Anyway, I appreciate your thoughts and help!Michel AaijMichel Aaij, Ph.D.
