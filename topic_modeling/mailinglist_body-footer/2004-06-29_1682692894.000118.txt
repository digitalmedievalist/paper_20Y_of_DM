it is extensible and revisable as we progress. The other reason I think 
the wiki might be a good idea, is it is almost perfectly suited for that 
exchange of information and training that a community of practice is 
supposed to have: somebody writes a first draft and that gets corrected 
as people learn more. Since wikis can have links, it also solves the 
problem of duplication of effort: look up XSLT or TEI in the digital 
medievalist wiki, and, after a brief explanation, you get directed to 
the specialist site and/or list.As you can see, I'm quite keen on it.
