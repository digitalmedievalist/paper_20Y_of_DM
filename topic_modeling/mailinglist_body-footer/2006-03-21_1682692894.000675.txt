write themselves and professional academics have very little incentive
to contribute to a commons unless it in some way furthers their status
and/or careers.We tend to see this as a negative thing--terrible academics, keeping
knowledge from us--but in fact I think at any rate that it is a real
reflection of the cost of the research. I've been working for ages on a
history of medievalist fonts for our wiki--or rather wanted to work on
it for ages--but after the easy pickings were done, it has become
increasingly difficult to put off other research projects to do the real
slogging. If this was an article for PMLA or Speculum, I'd find the
time.And I run the DM wiki! If the owners find it difficult to get the time
(and between you and me, I think we must be responsible for about 80% of
what's there), it is even more difficult for those who can't point later
to the general flourishing of the whole enterprise as a personal
success.Interestingly, I have been putting some effort into an article for the
Wikipedia... but they assign the equivalent of gold stars for featured
articles which is what I'm trying to get. Before that became a
possibility, I didn't do the basic stuff we do to finish an article
(checking references are exactly in the right style, and the like). And
my contribution was purely parasitical. Having just written a book on
Caedmon and his Hymn, I could pretty much cut and paste a small
encyclopedia article.My own view for a community of practice like this is that prestige is
the only real currency. At the end of the day, contributors to a commons
need ultimately to have the value of their work recognised: by community
status, by public recognition, or by some other tangible reward. And
good work needs to be recognised as being better than average in some
way before much will actually be done.Also commons and communities like this probably need to find the right
niche: nobody is going to publish in a wiki something they could publish
in a journal; but people might consider publishing incidental
by-products they otherwise have no outlet for.The open software community has some of this down very well: you gain
administrative privileges (Wikipedia) or a special class of user name
(Ubuntu forums) if you contribute regularly and fruitfully to the
commons. I believe you once told me of a project that allowed you
greater and greater freedom to make changes on the basis of how
infrequently the changes you made were rolled back.None of this will get you tenure, but there really is no free lunch. -dOn Tue, 2006-21-03 at 22:15 +0000, James Cummings wrote:
