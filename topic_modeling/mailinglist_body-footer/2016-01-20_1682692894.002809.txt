"Deciphering Secrets: Unlocking the Manuscripts of Medieval Spain" Massive
Open Online Course where we are crowdsourcing manuscript transcriptions.
See here: https://www.coursera.org/course/medievalspain. Currently, we have
an enrollment of 5,700 students and it would be great if we gather just a
couple more students for this free 12-week course on coursera.org. Below is
a short course description that you may wish to share with colleagues and
students. Also, we are rolling out a larger series of Deciphering Secrets
MOOCs -- covering Burgos, Toledo, and Granada -- over the next several
years. Anyone can register for updates on the launches of these courses at
http://decipheringsecrets.com.Thank you and have a great new year!Prof. Martinez-Davila

Muslims in late medieval, fifteenth century Spain. Serving as
