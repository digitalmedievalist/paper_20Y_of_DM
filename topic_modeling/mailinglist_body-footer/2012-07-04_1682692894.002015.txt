Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitDear Digital Medievalist community,I have the pleasure of announcing the results from the DM elections
2012. In no particular order the elected members of the community
were:- Alexei Lavrentiev
- Orietta Da Rold
- Takako Kato
- Timoty LeonardiI would like to thank the other candidates for standing and providing
us with an outstandingly rich choice.  The election results were
extremely close with all candidates scoring well.  Unfortunately only
about 10% of the DM mailing list was able to be convinced into voting,
which is usual, but I hope that will improve in coming years.I would also like to say goodbye to Marjorie Burghart and James
Ginther who did not stand for re-election. Their contributions will,
of course, be missed but I'm sure that they will continue sterling
work as community volunteers. (And I would, of course, suggest other
people wanting to do volunteer work to contact the DM board.)This also marks the end of my term as Director of Digital Medievalist
(because of the change in the bylaws on term limits we introduced last
year to promote a regular changeover of people), and so a sad moment
in some ways for me.  I have greatly enjoyed the work of trying to
steer DM into new developments and ways of working. A lot of DM
developments I've been involved with have been behind-the-scenes and I
expect that I'll continue providing a certain amount of technical
support in that manner as a community volunteer.The new board will have a meeting as soon as possible and choose a new
person from within their midst to be the new director, and this will
be announced here.Best wishes to the new DM board, and the DM community as a whole,James Cummings
(soon-to-be-ex Director of Digital Medievalist)
