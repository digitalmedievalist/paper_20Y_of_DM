Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Dominique,Thanks for getting back to me!I look forward to reading the papers relating to the Handwritten=20
Text Recognition you used. Can you please point me to them (or let=20
me know where they'll be published when they're ready, if they=20
aren't yet available)? OCR is a field I've been involved in for a=20
while, though I'm only just starting to learn about handwriting=20
recognition. Does the A2iA approach use neural networks, and=20
leverage some open source software within it, I wonder? I look=20
forward to finding out from the journal articles!Excellent news that you'll be releasing the plain text in due=20
course, under an appropriately non-restrictive license. Out of=20
curiousity, how is the output from the text recognition engine being=20
stored and used at the moment? Is it in some XML format listing=20
locations and alternatives for words, or is it in a database, or=20
something else? For bonus credits you could always release that too;=20
though probably it'd be a bit niche for anyone else to reuse, who=20
knows, and it could provide a good exemplar for good practise for=20
others to follow or investigate when designing their own project.Great project, I've enjoyed reading about it, and keep up the good=20
work.NickOn Thu, Jun 29, 2017 at 12:37:25PM +0200, Dominique Stutzmann wrote:
