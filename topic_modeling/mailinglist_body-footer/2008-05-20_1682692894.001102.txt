To: TEI-L(a)listserv.brown.eduJoin us at OUCS this summer for two workshops organized by the
Research Technologies Service. During the week July 21st to 25th, the
TEI team at Oxford is once again offering special training in text
encoding principles and techniques.  This year we have two workshops:
* XML, TEI, and beyond: July 21st-23rd 2008This three-day course combines in-depth coverage of the latest version
of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Recommendations for the encoding
of digital text with hands-on practical exercises in their
application. If you are a project manager, research assistant, or
encoder working on any kind of project concerned with the creation or
management of large amounts of digital text, this course is for you.
* XML processing using XSLT: July 24th-25th 2008This is a two-day technical course is a practical guide to the use of
XSLT to do more than simply render your XML documents.  Aimed at
project research assistants, encoders, and programmers, it provides
in-depth coverage of the principles and practice of the W3C's
extensible Stylesheet language, focussing on its use as a general
purpose text manipulation and processing language.Interested? Please register as soon as possible, as places are
limited. The two workshops are independent of each other, but we're
pleased to announce a 20% discount is available if you register for
both.For further information and booking, please visit
