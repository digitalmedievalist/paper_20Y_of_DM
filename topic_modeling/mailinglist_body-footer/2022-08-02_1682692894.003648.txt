ens Institute, Amsterdam) have just released an updated version (v2.3.1) of o=
ur database of early medieval manuscripts transmitting the Etymologiae of Isi=
dore of Seville. In April last year, we presented a beta version containing 4=
61 manuscripts - now we can update this number to 492 manuscripts (and counti=
ng!). We hope that we will be able to beat the magic boundary of 500 codices =
soon.The database is accessible at: https://db.innovatingknowledge.nl/.You can read more about the criteria for the inclusions of manuscripts, datab=
ase's sources, functionality and plans at: https://innovatingknowledge.nl/?pa=
ge_id=3D33.We are particularly glad that most of the included manuscripts (375 to be mor=
e precise) have been digitized. The database has an integrated Mirador viewer=
 that allows you to access, compare and work with approximately 300 manuscrip=
ts with IIIF manifests directly via its interface (just click on the IIIF log=
o under the manuscript image). We hope that we will be able to add more digit=
ized manuscripts and manuscripts with IIIF manifests in the future to make th=
is database a digital manuscript library as well.For those who may be interested in reusing the data collected by the project,=
 we are also releasing the complete datasheet underlying the database at our =
project's outputs page: https://innovatingknowledge.nl/?page_id=3D40.We hope you will find this resource useful for your research and an inspirati=
on for your own digital projects.We are still in a short grace period, so if you note particularly nasty bugs =
(some of which we are aware of and currently fixing, like incorrect display o=
f & in manuscript shelfmarks), errors, typos, or you think information could =
be added (such as to recent publications of yours on one or more of the featu=
red manuscripts), we will be glad to hear from you.Best wishes,Evina
