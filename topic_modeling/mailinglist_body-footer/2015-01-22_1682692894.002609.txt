highest scores are guaranteed a slot at the conference. The Program
Committee will curate the remainder of the program in an effort to ensure
diversity in program content and presenters. Community votes will, of
course, still weigh heavily in these decisions. Proposers will be notified
by March 1.For more information about the Keystone DH Conference, which will be held
