entirely different reason.  In my chosen mail client (Mozilla
Thunderbird, which in its most recent versions I highly recommend), I
have an extension installed called 'QuoteCollapse'.  If you find 
yourself on many lists where people do not trim messages, then it
is extremely useful.  It collapses previously quoted material to have
only its first line visible with one of those + or - icons to expand or
collapse the rest of the quote body.  While making sure to trim messages
down to their relevant portions is of course something we should
encourage, I thought others might like to know of this Thunderbird
Extension.Apologies for any previous lack of trimming,
