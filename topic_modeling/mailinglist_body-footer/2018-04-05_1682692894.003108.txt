on the University of Pennsylvania campus from March 7-9, 2019. The overall th=
eme of the conference is "The Global Turn in Medieval Studies." As a co-chair=
 of the organizing committee, I would especially like to invite members of th=
e dm- list to propose papers or sessions relating to the thread "Digitizing t=
he Global Middle Ages: Practices, Sustainability, and Ethics." While this thr=
ead can be broadly interpreted, our aim is to further conversations on the ro=
le and value of digitization in the preservation of our shared cultural herit=
age and on the practices and ethics of digitizing across cultural and geograp=
hic boundaries.If you are interested in submitting a proposal, please consult the CFP, avail=
able here: www.medievalacademy.org/page/2019Meeting<http://www.medievalacadem=
y.org/page/2019Meeting>.Individuals or groups may propose a poster, paper, full session, roundtable o=
r workshop. Membership in the Medieval Academy is required to present at the =
conference, but special consideration will be given to individuals whose fiel=
ds would not traditionally involve membership in the Medieval Academy. Propos=
als are due June 15, 2018.Please feel free to distribute this announcement to other lists that may have=
 interested members.And please don't hesitate to contact me or any member of the organizing commi=
ttee (names appear on CFP) if you have questions.Best,
Lynn
