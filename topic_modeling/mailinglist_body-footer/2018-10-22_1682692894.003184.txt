iversity of Pennsylvania is pleased to present the 11th Annual Lawrence J. Sc=
hoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age:
IIlluminations: Manuscript, Medium, Message<https://www.library.upenn.edu/abo=
ut/events/kislak/SIMS/ljs-symposium11>
November 15-17, 2018
Manuscript illumination has often been considered in relation to the texts it=
 accompanies, but rarely in terms of its interplay with other artistic media.=
 Historically, however, the technique was closely associated with other forms=
 of artistic expression and served as a crucial point of contact and transfer=
 for visual motifs across space and time. The goal of this year's symposium i=
s to examine cases of intermedial exchange through the lenses of technique, s=
tyle, iconography, social context, and cultural geography, while also posing =
broader questions about the deep connections between the craft of illuminatio=
n and other arts more widely. Of special interest will be insights gained fro=
m the technical examination of works in different media, new comparisons made=
 possible by digital technology, and the discovery of linkages once obscured =
by strict historiographical divisions
The program will begin Thursday evening at 5:00 pm on November 15, 2018, at t=
he Free Library of Philadelphia, Parkway Central Library, with a keynote lect=
ure by Professor Susie Nash of the Courtauld Institute of Art. The symposium =
will continue November 16th-17th at the Kislak Center of Special Collections,=
 Rare Books, and Manuscripts at the University of Pennsylvania.
