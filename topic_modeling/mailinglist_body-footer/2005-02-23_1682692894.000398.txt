Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI have a couple of questions about XML.  Actually, I am not sure if XML is
the right programming language to use.I have a database ready to go, but I would like to put it on the web for
people to use.  I was thinking about linking the db to an xml file then
creating an html page that will pull the information from the xml file. 
But something tells me that this is not the simplest way to do things.I know another way I can do things, which would be completly different and
more complex, using a db and C# linking it to an html page extracting the
C# and the db from a few lines of javascript.  Not pretty!If anyone has some suggestions or knows a good tutorial I am all ears!!! or
eyes actually :)Abdullah
