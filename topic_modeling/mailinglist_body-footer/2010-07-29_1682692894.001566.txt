texts:        http://www.horstmann.com/ChiWriter/Its internal format was rather simple and easy to reverse-engineer,
you can find its short description e.g. at    http://mirror.ctan.org/support/chi2tex/read.meI should have still the C source code of a converter to TeX by
Horstman          http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb12-3-4/tb33horstman.pdfbut the legal status of it is not clear for me. I've received it
indirectly without any conditions, but later its author started to
sell the program. This=20     http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/chi2tex/contains unfortunately only binaries (which you can however still run,
at least in principle, under Free-DOS in a virtual machine).This     http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/chi2ltx/may also be of some use.Best regardsJSB--=20
