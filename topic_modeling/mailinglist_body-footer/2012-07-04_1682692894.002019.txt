on Wednesday, June 11th, 8 PM onwards, in the Stables Pub at Weetwood Hall.As you know, Digital Medievalist is an international web-based community
for medievalists working with digital media, with more than 750 members.
This email discussion list is the most important link among the community,
but the IMC in Leeds offers the opportunity to meet, and as a member of the
Executive Board of Digital Medievalist, I hope that the most of you will be
able to show up et get a chance to meet other scholars with related
interests and methodologies *in real life*.
You will find below the list of some sessions and papers you might be
interested in (selection based on key words "digit*" "comput*" "data*"
and/or indexed under the theme "Computing in Medieval Studies").Regards,Dominique Stutzmann

Session*403* Title*Seals and Sigillography: What Is Their Future in a
Digital Age? - A Round Table Discussion* Date/TimeMonday 9 July 2012:
19.30-20.30  SponsorSigillum  OrganiserJohn Cherry, Independent Scholar,
Ludlow  Moderator/ChairJohn Cherry, Independent Scholar, Ludlow
AbstractArranged
in the year that Sigillum, the website for the encouragement of research
and the study of seals, was established, this round table will discuss the
future for the study of seals and sigillography in the digital age. Is
sigillography a study in its own right or is it simply the handmaid of
history and art history? One of the goals of Sigillum is to encourage the
use of seal and seal matrices in the study, teaching and writing of history
(of all kinds, including social history and art history), archaeology,
palaeography, archival studies, and other allied subjects. Whatever its
status, how should the study develop in this digital age? All those
interested in seals and seal matrices, of whatever country and period, are
warmly invited.Participants include Julian Gardner (University of Warwick), Paul D. A.
Harvey (Durham University), and Elizabeth New (Aberystwyth University).Session*627* Title*Mabillon's Heirs: New Diplomatics - Young Scholars*

Jinna Smit, Nationaal Archief, Den Haag   AbstractDiplomatic studies, as an
old science, have renewed themselves these last years with the new
perspectives brought by the study of literacy. The famous technical way of
studying documents is not only used for the *discrimen veri ac falsi*, but
also to bring into new light the practices of writing in particular
societies, in connection with social studies and cultural studies. These
two sessions aim to focus on new projects initiated by young scholars at
the beginning of their research, in order to help them to connect
themselves with the scientific community and to improve their own way of
searching.Session*727* Title*Producing, Keeping, and Reusing Documents: Charters and

David Peterson, Universidad del Pa=C3=ADs Vasco   AbstractThe session will
address the ways in which documents were kept, copied and reused in
northern Iberia in the period between the late 9th and the 12th century.
The first paper will focus on the single charters which survive from the
earlier end of this period to investigate how documents were produced and
kept before the production of the later monastic cartularies, while the
second and the third paper will discuss the rationale behind the
construction of some of the most significant cartularies which were
compiled in that region between the end of the 11th and the 12th century.

al
rules and agreements, literary structures and rules, religious orders and
rules of the Middle Aages that have survived up to modern times. But they
have not been the same ones. For instance sometimes only a word still
exists with another meaning or not exactly equivalent meaning, as
'Ritterlichkeit' or with different meaning 'wib : weib'. We still know some
religious customs and rules but they don't have this high relevance for our
everyday life as they had in the middle ages. For some occasions we still
have dress-codes but they are aimed other events and other groups of people
and other dressings. We still know the lyrics and the epics, the literary
texts of the Middle Ages but nowadays they are told in a different way,
sometimes for a different audience and, of course, they appear in another
media. This session will give three exemples of this turn of rules.

Peter A. Stokes, Department of Digital Humanities, King's College London
AbstractMedieval writing, as part of the interpersonal communication
process, had to follow rules that ensure the legibility and convey the
meaning of a text. Latin or vernacular, spoken or read, charter on
parchment, painting, or stained-glass: different functions, social
contexts, and publics lead to variations in the use of scripts during the
Middle Ages. This session explores the representational modes of the text
as an image and the concept of 'liberty' for scripts in regard to the
staging of spoken or vernacular texts in epigraphy (Latin/vernacular) and
to the degree of stability and variation in vernacular scripts.Session*1303* Title*GIS as a Tool for Understanding Medieval Road Systems*

Oana Toda, Babe=C8=99-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca   AbstractThis session is
primarily concerned with the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
in creating a method of modeling historical roads. Very often, medieval
roads cited in historical sources are no longer existent, and locating a
known route could be impossible; GIS surveys, combined with an extensive
analysis of historical sources and archeological data, can be an excellent
tool to reconstruct the outline of a road, or of a network of roads,
offering the historians an invaluable help.Session*1319* Title*'Ruling' the Script, III: Measure and Sense*

AbstractMedieval
writing, as part of the interpersonal communication process, had to follow
rules that ensure the legibility and convey the meaning of a text. The
digital humanities in palaeography give birth to a renewed quantitative
approach, either as computer-aided palaeography or as digital palaeography
with automated image-analysis softwares. This session explores what can be
measured (angles, inclination, collective scribal profiles, and allographs)
and how this new data can be analysed (databases, factorial analysis,
cross-validation). The results give new insights on the dynamic of script
evolution, and how it relates to the social contexts of written production.Session*1402* Title*'The Paradox of Medieval Scotland' Database as a

Relationships between individuals, as well as information about them, are

database, completed towards the end of 2010, has been designed as a
research tool not only for historians of Scotland, but for anyone with an
interest in the process of 'Europeanisation', or who wishes to include a
comparative dimension to their research. The workshop will consist of a
brief introduction to the database, a couple of case studies where it has
been used in research, followed by questions and discussion.Participants include Amanda Beam (Department of History (Scottish),

*Picturing Language and Landscapes in The Book of Sir John Mandeville*
(Language: English)
Galia Halpern, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University   AbstractPaper
-a:
My paper explores ornamental metalwork mountings (Lower Saxon and
Venetian,12th- through 13th-century) that adorned, mimicked, and/or
otherwise dialogued meaningfully with newly obtained treasury objects of
Islamic and Byzantine origin. While art historians have studied overt ways
in which high-medieval and post-1204 Western treasury objects emulated
Islamic and Byzantine imports (e.g. regarding relic visibility), episodes
of subtler metalwork evocation (eg, filigree patterns and ornament
disposition) have yet to be firmly detailed and analyzed. My paper, broadly
contextualized by debates over ornament-embodied meaning, specifically
considers a narrow selection of Western, Byzantine, and Islamic treasury
objects at Halberstadt, San Marco, and Eichstätt.Paper -b:
In the late medieval period, no vernacular language text enjoyed as wide
circulation as *The Book of Sir John Mandeville*. This travel account
proposed an image of the knowable world, mediated by the eyewitness
observations of its now infamous author/narrator. Included in Mandeville's
description of diverse regions is a running commentary about the alphabets
in use by exotic peoples. My investigation into the illustrated manuscripts
of the Book conceives of these alphabets within cartographic and
ethnographic systems upon which landscape and body are mutually
constituted. This paper looks at the pictorial evolution of these alphabets
throughout the book's transmission.--===============4094190843566307547==
