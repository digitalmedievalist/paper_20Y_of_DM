8-11, 2008, Kalamazoo, MichiganThe Medieval Academy of America Committee on Electronic Resources invites
submissions to the following sponsored session:"Digital Media and Peer Review in Medieval Studies"Medievalists are increasingly turning to digital media both to produce new
types of scholarship such as encoded texts and non-bookish digital projects
(e.g. archives and interactive electronic resources) and to advance and
increase the efficiency of traditional forms of scholarship such as critical
editions.  There is not yet widespread agreement, however, regarding how
this new work should count for academic promotion, and many scholars working
in these new media find that there are few established avenues for getting
their work peer reviewed.  At the same time, we are witnessing rapid and
widespread changes in how we use print texts (e.g. often in scanned,
searchable copies), and many traditional publishers of print journals and
monographs are under enormous financial pressures from declining sales and
print runs, thereby further limiting access to peer review and opportunities
for publication.  How can we, as a community, bring scholarship, publishing,
and the need for peer review into balance?Please email abstracts (not to exceed 300 words) to Timothy Stinson (
stinson(a)jhu.edu). Please include name, professional/university affiliation,
and contact information.
