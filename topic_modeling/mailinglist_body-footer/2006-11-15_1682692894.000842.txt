Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableAbdullah,I'd second what Notis is suggesting here.  Using a format like: >     <L 2>   =C3=B0u eart se weallstan         =C3=BEe =C3=B0a wyrhtan iuis really moving backwards in technological development to the 1980s and mark=
up=20
languages like COCOA and OCP.  We have lots of stuff in such terrible formats=
 in=20
the Oxford Text Archive, and it is a pain to convert.  Using XML, as Notis=20
suggests, would allow you to take advantage of all the existing tools for=20
creating, manipulating, transforming and querying XML.  You can always transf=
orm=20
from a TEI XML structure like:<l n=3D"2">=C3=B0u eart se weallstan         =C3=BEe =C3=B0a wyrhtan iu</l>back to<L 2>   =C3=B0u eart se weallstan         =C3=BEe =C3=B0a wyrhtan iureally really easily, if that is how some other input program suggests.
Murray:  To answer your original question, I remember doing something similar=
 in=20
emacs eons ago.  (I've given up on emacs and use oxygen for most=20
text/script/program files and OO for everything else.)  I can't remember if i=
t=20
was a built-in function from some package I had installed, or whether I knock=
ed=20
up a bit of elisp to do it.  Let me know if you are desperate to do it this w=
ay=20
and I can dig back through my old elisp files somewhere.For the record, the way I would do this now would be one of two ways:
1) For a quick hack where I needed to do it quickly I would add the line numb=
ers=20
automatically to the text file in openoffice and then just cut and paste it b=
ack=20
into my text editor.  (Inefficient I know...)
2) I have an XSLT script which will read in a plain text file and output=20
everything in <l> (with a new <lg> for any blank lines between stanzas.However, I would echo what I'd say to Abdullah above.  *Why* add line numbers=
?=20
The *only* reason really to add line numbers these days is if the line number=
ing=20
is irregular for some reason. (i.e. the text goes 1,2,3,4, *big burnt=20
hole*,12,13,14.)  Amazingly, computers are really good at counting, and count=
ing=20
lines is easy.  So, mark everything up as <l> and then just number them=20
automatically when producing a presentation version.Just my tuppence,-JamesNotis Toufexis wrote:
