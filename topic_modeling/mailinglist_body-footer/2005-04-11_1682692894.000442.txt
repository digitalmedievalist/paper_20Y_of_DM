Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI think you're in the grey zone where IE just hasn't implemented
generated text in CSS. There may be help in the demo files here:
http://www.xhtmlchef.com/stc2004.asp . Also, since the French and
Italian quotes work, have you tried q:lang(ENG)?By the way, XHTML 2 seems to be dropping the <q> tag and replacing it
with <quote>, which explicitly requires the author and not the browser
to provide the quotation marks
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xhtml2-20040722/mod-text.html#sec_9.8. ).
So I don't suppose we'll see support for CSS-specified quotation marks
added to browsers that don't already support them.
