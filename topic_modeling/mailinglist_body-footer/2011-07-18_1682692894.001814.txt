development during its funded period and some of the intellectual
content (transcription, markup, etc.), and then Richard Lewis did
further development on this afterwards. It was running perfectly find
until a server replacement meant that the server it was on was
decommissioned.  Since neither Richard nor I work for UEA any more
they were unwilling to let us have access to their servers to set it
up again.  We have approached them several times to try and sort this
out, it really wouldn't be too difficult.  All the data is safe and
backed up so the site could certainly be put up again.  The problem
comes that since David's death all IPR residing in the project belongs
to the University of East Anglia, rather than myself or Richard. (This
is in spite of David's own desire for this material to be openly
available.)  I spent 3 years of my life working on it and would love
it to be put back up. I'm occasionally contacted by people who wish
access to it, and I forward them on to UEA as reminders while pointing
them to the wayback machine version.  Your message has spurred me to
try again.Apologies,-James
