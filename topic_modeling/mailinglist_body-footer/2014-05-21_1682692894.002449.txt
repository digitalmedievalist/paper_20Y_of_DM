"Digital Pre-Modernist" site, though, so let's try to keep some basic=20

n if we chose to keep the wiki, however, the Board feels that the Byelaws sho=

ed even if we keep the existing infrastructure. The details of the proposed c=

new website, but in essence we propose simply to replace the term 'wiki' with=
 'information resources' and to adapt the containing sentences accordingly.
