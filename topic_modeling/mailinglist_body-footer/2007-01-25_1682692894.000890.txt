material on the Dictionary of Old English CD (I'm talking about the 
dictionary proper, not the corpus or other materials) running under 
Linux. I've made a basic index with links to the entries, so it's sort 
of usable. But although it probably wouldn't be horribly difficult to 
put this index in the order used in Old English dictionaries, and even 
get some of the search functionality now enjoyed by Internet Explorer 
users, I'm not terribly eager to do it myself. If there's a nice index 
and/or some Linux programming out there for the DOE, and someone's in a 
sharing mood, I'd be terribly grateful.Peter Baker--===============8093516104404253825==--
