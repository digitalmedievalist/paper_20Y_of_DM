Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitDear DM List,I've organized a session (sponsored by the MAA's Committee on
Electronic Resources) at the International Medieval Congress in Leeds,
but unfortunately I am unable to attend as moderator. It's session
129, "New Work in Digital Medieval Studies: Visualization and
Interpretation", with papers by Malte Rehbein, Franz Fischer, and
Nadia Altschul.http://imc.leeds.ac.uk/imcapp/SessionDetails.jsp?SessionId=2817&year=2009If there is anyone on the list who will be attending Leeds, doesn't
have anywhere else to be on July 13, 2009 11.15-12.45, and finds the
topic of this session particularly interesting and would like to
moderate it, please contact me off-list.Many thanks,
Dot--
