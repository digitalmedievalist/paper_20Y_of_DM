The 7th Computers, Literature and Philology (CLiP) conference:

===========================================================ABOUT CLiP        The international Computers, Literature and Philology (CLiP) conference has
taken place at a variety of European universities since the first conference
in 1998. The initiative for the first seminar was taken by literary scholars
who were not only aware of the importance of new technologies for the
humanities, but also of what the humanities had contributed to the creation
of digital culture in general and to the content of the Internet in
particular.The discussions at CLiP conferences focus on the integration of Philology
and Information Technology. In this context, 'Literature' and 'Philology'
are to be understood in more general terms. 'Literature' means all sorts of
texts (spoken, written, hypertext etc.), which may also contain images,
sound materials, graphs etc. 'Philology' means the scholarship devoted to
these texts from diverse perspectives. The theoretical and practical
questions posed by the creation of digital materials and the integration of
Philology and media technologies are debated. The implications for research
and teaching are examined and current projects in the field are presented.This conference can best be seen as a three-day seminar, in that there are
no parallel sessions, there is as coherent an academic focus as possible and
the participation of young scholars is actively encouraged. One of the key
objectives of CLiP is to open an independent humanities computing space
specifically - although not exclusively - dedicated to the emerging
humanities computing communities in the fields of study that are relevant to
the Romance languages areas.CLiP conferences approach these issues from a multicultural European
perspective and aim to foment international collaboration in research and
teaching as a result. These discussions are part of the international debate
about the discipline of Humanities Computing which is happening at the
interface between the Humanities and Information Technology. The
participants are also interested in the exchange of ideas, methods and
techniques with scholars from outside Europe.CONFERENCE THEMESWe welcome submissions that discuss any aspect of the interface between
