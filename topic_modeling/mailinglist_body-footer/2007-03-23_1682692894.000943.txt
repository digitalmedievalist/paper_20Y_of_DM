To: AHDS-HISTORY(a)JISCMAIL.AC.UKThe AHRC ICT Methods Network, a UK initiative for the exchange and
dissemination of expertise in the use of ICT for arts and humanities
research, has just launched an online community forum on =C2=91digital=C2=92 =
history:=C2=91Tools and Methods for the Digital Historian=C2=92
(http://www.digital-historian.net) is the first of a set of integrated
online communities related to Methods Network activities and resources and
is a forum for open discussion of all issues relating to digital history. In
particular we invite comments on a working paper by Neil Grindley (Methods
Network) entitled =C2=91Tools and Methods for Historical Research=C2=92 which=
 we hope
will become the basis of a community resource. We are keen on getting more
input and would very much like to include your feedback in future versions
of the paper.This paper contains sections on: Tools and Web Resources; Database
Structures; Data Mining; Quantitative Methods; Visualization; and
Geographical Information Systems. It may appeal to different types of
readers in different ways. Some people might find this paper contains useful
introductory material to digital tools and methods and may wish to explore a
number of useful links to relevant websites. Those who already have a
sophisticated understanding of the use of ICT tools for historical research
might wish to use the contents of this paper as a jumping off point for
discussing other areas of research that have not been referred to, or which
have been mentioned and would benefit from additional elucidation.The paper can be downloaded from our website as a PDF:

the AHDS-History list and we would be keen on your input:http://www.digital-historian.net/viewtopic.php?id=3D4 this thread started as a
discussion about electronic publishing and now features a discussion of the
value of =C2=91Web 2.0=C2=92 for researchhttp://www.digital-historian.net/viewtopic.php?id=3D12 this thread continues
the discussion about electronic publishing and asks about tools and methods
for electronic publishing platforms for researchersFor all questions regarding 'Digital Historian' and Methods Network
community building in general please contact our Senior Research Project
Coordinator Torsten Reimer (Torsten.Reimer(a)kcl.ac.uk).
