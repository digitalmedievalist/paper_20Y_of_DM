line) EEBO, conversion from microfilm to digital is not always terrifically s=
uccessful. Film is an analogue process and resolution is therefore measured i=
n lines per inch (lpi). Digital resolution is measured in  dots per inch (dpi=
). There is a conversion factor of  roughly 2.2 x lpi =3D dpi which can be us=
ed but this is a very crude conversion. Also, microfilm can be at a variety o=
f physical lpi resolutions and even colour. It all depends on the speed of th=
e film, the grain size and the origination. So the best thing would be either=
 to use a dedicated microfilm scanner such as a Zeutschel which works things =
out automatically by sampling or to try digitising a single microfilm frame a=
t various resolutions and see which gives you the best result at (say) 75dpi,=
 150dpi, 300dpi, 360dpi or 400dp when you zoom in under (say) Photoshop. Then=
 use that reference value for the rest of the scans of that microfilm roll.You are correct that to scan a microfilm frame at a resolution higher than th=
e film grain would be a pointless exercise because scanning at too high a res=
olution would just be scanning noise as you can only scan the film grains tha=
t are present in the film gelatin suspension.RegardsTony HarrisSent from my iPhone.On 24 Mar 2014, at 19:29, "Michelson, David Allen" <david.a.michelson(a)Vande=
