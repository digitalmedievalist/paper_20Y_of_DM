erstanding the use of digital technologies by scholars of medieval studies.Principal Investigator: Krishna Venkatasubramanian, PhDResearch purpose: The aim of this study is to understand the use of digital t=
echnologies by scholars of medieval studies and to see how well these tools w=
ork for them, when they fail, and what can be done to improve them. We also p=
lan to see how disability and chronic conditions affect these trends.Protocol: We will be conducting online interviews via videoconference for thi=
s study. This study entails a set of interviews, approximately 45-60 minutes =
long, with individual staff members.  They will be conducted remotely via vid=
eoconference, e.g., Zoom.Video recordings will be made during all sessions of the study. The recording=
s will then be transcribed, and the original recording will be deleted once t=
he transcription is verified to be accurate.
Benefits: There are no anticipated benefits to the participants other than th=
e study affording ideas for better designs of digital tools and technologies =
for scholars of medieval studies.
Eligibility: Participants for this study should be adults who are active rese=
arch scholars in one of the various sub-disciplines of medieval studies. In a=
ddition, they must: use digital technologies for their research in medieval s=
tudies; be willing to use Zoom to participate in the interview, which will be=
 recorded for transcription purposes; and be currently located in the US or C=
anada (due to restrictions on compensating participants). Researchers with a =
chronic health condition and/or disability are particularly welcome.Time commitment: 45-60 minutes
Mode of interview: All interviews will be conducted remotely via Zoom or othe=
r teleconferencing system conducive to the participants.Compensation: You will be compensated $50 in the form of gift card for your p=
articipation.This research has been approved by The University of Rhode Island Institution=
al Review Board.Please let us know if you are interested in participating.Thanks very much,
