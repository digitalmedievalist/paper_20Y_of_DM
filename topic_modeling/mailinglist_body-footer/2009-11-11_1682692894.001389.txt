are registered for PhDs in the United Kingdom.
Medieval Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age: 17-22 May 2010The Institute of English Studies (London) is pleased to announce the  
second year of this AHRC-funded course in collaboration with the  
University of Cambridge, the Warburg Institute, and King's College  
London.The course is open to arts and humanities doctoral students registered  
at UK institutions. It involves six days of intensive training on the  
analysis, description and editing of medieval manuscripts in the  
digital age to be held jointly in Cambridge and London. Participants  
will receive a solid theoretical foundation and hands-on experience in  
cataloguing and editing manuscripts for both print and digital formats.The first half of the course involves morning classes and then visits  
to libraries in Cambridge and London in the afternoons. Participants  
will view original manuscripts and gain practical experience in  
applying the morning's themes to concrete examples. In the second half  
we will address the cataloguing and description of manuscripts in a  
digital format with particular emphasis on the Text Encoding  
Initiative (TEI). These sessions will also combine theoretical  
principles and practical experience and include supervised work on  
computers.The course is aimed principally at those writing dissertations which  
relate to medieval manuscripts, especially those on literature, art  
and history. There are no fees, but priority will be given to PhD  
students funded by the AHRC. Class sizes are limited to twenty and  
places are 'first-come-first-served' so early registration is strongly  
recommended.For further details see http://ies.sas.ac.uk/study/mmsda/ or contact
