id that the "data is the edition" and that the role of the software is only t=
o extract data to present it to the user. I think there is as much scholarshi=
p in the interface as there is on the data, in particular if we use standards=
 such the TEI that allow us to encode the same things in different ways (abbr=
eviations and expansion, errors and corrections, etc.): the way we select the=
se features and the way we present them tells loads about our vision and unde=
rstanding of the text and have enormous consequences in the reception and imp=
act of our scholarship. This, of course, makes things more complex as we are =
bound to preserve the data and the interfaces=E2=80=A6=20Getting back to the main object of the thread which was generated by Dot's ex=
cellent article: I don't think people don't use digital scholarly editions be=
cause they may disappear any day soon, I think they do not because we -- the =
editors -- have organised them around what we want to do with them, and have =
forgotten to ask the readers what they want instead. People read on screen al=
l the time: Kindles and iPad and the eBook market boom shows this very clearl=
y, they simply don't read scholarly editions on the web. I think there is a r=
eflection to be had here on the way we deliver our scholarship and on the cen=
trality of our interfaces. Thanks again to Dot for drawing our attention to t=
his.=20Best
