Bodleian  is to be praised for making images available on the web without 
charge and on the CD for a very reasonable cost.What I DO want to address (only on the basis of Peter Baker's comment about 
Mac OS X) is the question of the use of the CD on Macs, either OS 9.x or X. 
To make CDs that run only on Microsoft operating systems is to exclude a 
significant subgroup of potential users.(I only hope that the info about Mac X and the CD is wrong; I suspect it is 
not.)In any case, thanks to the Bodleian; I can use the online images.  Maybe 
I'll buy a program to run "the other OS" on my mac or go to the library. 
Sigh!Grover ZinnGrover A. Zinn
