of a social challenge than a technical one) rather than the logistics of
producing images in the first place. Though by no means do I mean to
minimize the challenges of digitization. Indeed, the discussion of how to
meet the threshold of utility in image creation is a crucial first step.
But a larger (and somewhat utopian) vision of manuscript image access,
even with a latitude of image quality, is perhaps worth bearing in mind as
best
practices are worked out."One question is: what do we need the images for?  Another question is: are
we allowed to share the images?Fred's vision is not only beautiful, it is something that comes naturally
to researchers. The libraries, however, have different priorities,
especially as regards sharing of their material (or images thereof).  To
put manuscript images in a repository, I have to ask for permission the
library or the archive whose manuscript I photographed; at this point the
institutions usually get uncomfortable, for all kinds of reasons; and if I
do something without permission, I'll be in trouble next time I have to
visit that place.  Yes, I know that a public institution *should* allow
the public to make its treasures public, but I also know that it's, well,
complicated.We are discussing open data here. The data should be open, and we could
all do much, much more with a shared repository for our manuscript images.
 But such a repository would at the moment have to function in a guerilla
way (I know of such repositories for Southern Slavic history, for example;
a nice approach is also <http://www.flickr.com/photos/uofglibrary/>, for
printed matter).What do others think? Would such a repository be possible? Does it exist
somewhere outside of institutional digitizing projects?Yours,NevenZagreb, Hrvatska / Croatia
