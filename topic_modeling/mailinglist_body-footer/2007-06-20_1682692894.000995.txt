----------------------------------------------------------------------Announcing this week's instalment of the Digital Classicist/ICS Work in
Progress Summer seminarsTim Hill (Cambridge)
'Wiser than the Undeceived? Past Worlds as Virtual Worlds in the 
Electronic Media'Time: Friday 22 June at 16:30
Place: Room NG16 Senate House, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HU
Brief abstract:
Despite frequent claims that the electronic media represent a decisive 
break with the textual past, when software designers claim to recreate 
historical realities in their work questions long-familiar to 
classicists immediately arise. What can or should be represented? What 
ought the relationship between reality and representation be? What is 
the relationship between cognition and emotion in artistic 
representations? In earlier periods, the limitations of computer 
processing speed and power rendered answers to such questions de facto 
or purely speculative; as the sophistication of digital representation 
increases, however, it is becoming clear that meaningful modern 
responses to these ancient philosophical questions must be based not 
upon computational, but formal and generic, criteria.All are welcome. 
The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments after which 
everyone is also welcome to join us in entertaining the speaker at a 
local venue.Best regards
