NeDiMAH last November
(http://www.nedimah.eu/call-for-papers/expert-meeting-digital-scholarly-editi=
ons)
and gave a paper titled "The battle we forgot to fight: Should we make a
case for digital editions?". In short, no, I think we should definitely
advocate creation and use of digital editions ... but also that first we
should define more clearly what a digital edition *is*, see Dot's
distinction above as a starting point (there surely are many other types
and sub-types). Personally I think we lack a clear perspective and need a
sort of "DEI" (Digital Edition Initiative) that can help interested
scholars with support, guidelines etc. (also help gather together,
conferences like ESTS and such are very useful, but we lack a "central"
place where to go).R
