'The value and price of information: reflections on e-publishing in the
humanities'ALL WELCOMEThe paper attempts a change of focus from the single project to a
broader range of e-publishing, considered by content and by target
audience. The discussion covers both complex html-publications and
scholarly papers. Potential fragilities are noted in the infrastructures
which support each type, and consideration is given to current
developments in archiving which aim to rectify them.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk or
