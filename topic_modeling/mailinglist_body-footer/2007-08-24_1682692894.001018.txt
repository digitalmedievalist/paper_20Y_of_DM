Nobody on the project is particularly technical.Because the members of the project are spread all over the place, they
need a version control system for keeping track of their documents. I'd
say they need subversion (the documents are PDFs and XML files), but I
need them to be able to see it in something like windows explorer.Has anybody any experience in setting up something like subversion for
use with Windows?-dan--===============3623128278098217923==--
