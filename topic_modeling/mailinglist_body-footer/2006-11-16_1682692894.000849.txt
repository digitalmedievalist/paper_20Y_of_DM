tudents and teachers. They have all kinds of information for students:  study=
 guides, textbook graphics, quizzes,  extra photos for graphic intensive subj=
ects like microscopy. The faculty CDs will come with teaching guides, text ba=
nks, powerpoint slides, text book graphics to make our own powerpoints, sugge=
sted lab experiments, etc. These CDs have really been the difference in which=
 textbooks are adopted for large classes. Science classes are often huge (>10=
0 in single lecture rooms or multiple sections) and each department tends to =
adopt the same text book for all sections of say microbiology or anatomy, so =
these are truly large text book purchases. The publishers have really jumped =
on CDs and websites as making the difference in getting the textbook order. O=
n the downside, textbook prices have skyrocketed. Its not unusual for a basic=
 science text book to cost > $100.=20

Other digital publications include all kinds of government agencies and unive=
rsity institutes. Our Institute of Biosecurity (Public Health) at St. Louis U=
 publishes about a half-dozen CDs on bioterrorism response that are sent out =
to government agencies and primary responders. I'm sitting here looking at an=
 Avian Flu Compendium that was supplied in both paper and on a CD (in the sam=
e package). The CD contains the entire paper compendium as pdfs. Given that t=
he CD has images of all the relavent public health notices and reports it is =
a modern primary source compendium as well.=20

I suspect that it won't be very long before science is virtually paperless...=

Subject: [dm-l] Digital presses
Hi all,I have a question: we all know presses that publish CD-ROMs of textual
projects, and some graphics projects. But what about things like
corpora, linguistic research, dictionaries, and other digital material
that are not intended as representations of primary sources? I can think
of some obvious examples (e.g. the DOE, I suppose the OED); but what
about projects on a smaller scale?Any ideas?-dan
