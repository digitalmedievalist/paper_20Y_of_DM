Fragments and Frameworks
Illuminated Manuscripts and Illustrated Books in Digital HumanitiesFriday, October 1
The study of art history has long dealt with fragments and processes of fragm=
entation. Illuminated manuscripts and illustrated books in particular may hav=
e their fragments and folia fugitiva=E2=80=94pieces of material=E2=80=94separ=
ated from a whole collection or corpus. Many thousands of drawings and miniat=
ures are dispersed around the world, including those donated to the National =
Gallery of Art by Lessing J. Rosenwald. The adoption of open-access online co=
llections has enabled new avenues for study. Open digital frameworks promise =
to bring new data and new attention to these objects and to ask critical ques=
tions about their provenance and conservation. This conference will discuss f=
ragments and frameworks, actual and conceptual, in art history and related di=
sciplines, and address emerging questions in digital humanities. What kinds o=
f afterlives are incurred by processes of fragmentation and cutting? How does=
 the concept of the frame or framework inform the study of illuminated manusc=
ripts and illustrated books? How does the concept of (digital) remediation in=
form our approach to these works?Program and registration links for morning and afternoon sessions<https://mai=
