Dear Digital Medievalists,
Ever since the publication of journal article The Language and Writing System=
 of Manuscript MS408 Explained, we have been busy translating the plant pages=
 in order to construct the lexicon for the manuscript. They all relate to mat=
ters of female reproduction and the complications that can arise, so the many=
 plant species are used for various medicines.In the latest paper the plant is used as a form of magic '=C3=A6a' for the pu=
rpose of rectifying the damage done by the extreme physical manipulation '=C3=
=A6ora' described in the previous paper. So, the manuscript does contain some=
 magic after all. :0)Here is the link to Plant Series, No. 5: https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/004917
Please spread the word far and wide.
Kindest regards,
Gerard.Dr. Gerard Cheshire.
