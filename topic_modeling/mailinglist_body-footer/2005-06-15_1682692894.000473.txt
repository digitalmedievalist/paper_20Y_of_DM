Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI transcribed Hall's Chronicle (1550) into tables in Word but I only had 
to create the table once.  When I finished a page, I copied it, pasted 
it below, then highlighted and deleted the text, leaving a blank table.  
A two-row, multi-column data table at the top of each transcribed page 
had details on the page, work notes, etc.Later on, however, when I contemplated using Watt's Concordance, I 
realized that line numbers  wouldn't be adequate by themselves, so I 
used some macros to add the page numbers.  If I were doing running text 
with continuous line numbers, I'd get Excel to do it automatically, 
using the Edit / Fill / Series (Column, Linear, 1 to whatever) function, 
then copy and paste into a Word table.I faithfully hyphenated as Hall's compositors did but I wish I hadn't, 
for it hinders searching for those words and would make a Watt-created 
concordance unreliable.  I may spin off one transcription version with 
hyphenation and create another without broken words.Cheers,
Al Magary
