Date: May 14-15, 2015
Location: School of Arts and Humanities, University of Coimbra, Portugal'Digital Literary Studies' is an international conference exploring
methods, tools, objects and digital practices in the field of literary
studies. The digitization of artifacts and literary practices, the adoption
of computational methods for aggregating, editing and analyzing texts as
well as the development of collaborative forms of research and teaching
through networking and communication platforms are three dimensions of the
ongoing relocation of literature and literary studies in the digital
medium. The aim of this two-day conference is to contribute to the mapping
of material practices and interpretative processes of literary studies in a
changing media ecology.We invite researchers to submit papers and posters on projects concerned
with the digital reinvention of literary studies. Possible topics include,
but are not limited to:   - computational literary analysis (macro analysis, data mining, distant
   reading, topic modelling; visualization, corpora);
   - digital philology (electronic editions and archives, textual
   databases);
   - computational literary creation (automatic generation of text, textual
   instruments, kinetic texts, locative narrative, etc.);
   - the teaching of literature in a digital context;
   - peer review and open access (new practices of collaboration,
   dissemination, transfer and validation of knowledge production).
The ‘Digital Literary Studies’ conference will take place at the School of
Arts and Humanities, University of Coimbra on May 14-15, 2015. Paper and
poster proposals should be submitted by *January 31, 2015* through
EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eld2015). We also
welcome panel proposals (three presenters per panel). All paper proposals
must be between 1500 and 2000 words (including references). Authors should
provide name, contact details, and institutional affiliation, as well as
title, abstract, and keywords for their paper. Authors will be notified of
the peer review results by February 15, 2015. Proposals can use any of the
following languages: Portuguese, English, Spanish, French, and Italian.
Selected articles resulting from the conference papers will be published in
