The Digital Medievalist is once more sponsoring sessions at =20
Kalamazoo.  We have had proposals for one panel and two paper sessions =20
accepted, thus:Panel: What every digital medievalist should know
This session will take up the theme of Jim Marchand's famous 'WEMSK' =20
series, focussing on how the omnipresence of digital technology has =20
changed what every medievalist -- teacher, scholar, reader, anyone -- =20
should know.  We used only to have books; then we had films, =20
television, and now we can everything in a small box, or in a browser =20
on our screen -- even, in a mobile phone.  How does this change what =20
we should do, how we should do it, what we should know?Papers: Exemplary instances of research using digital methods and =20
materials
Several decades into the digital revolution, we may fairly ask: what =20
has changed? For all the digital technology about us, are we still =20
doing research in the same way? We invite contributions from scholars =20
who have found research possibilities for any aspect of medieval =20
studies which could not have been available in the pre-digital world.  =20
This may be because the materials were not available, or it may be =20
because the methods were not available, or any combination of the two.Papers: Using digital materials in the classroom
We invite papers narrating how teachers have used digital materials =20
relating to any aspect of medieval studies in the undergraduate (or =20
graduate) classroom.  What are the benefits, difficulties, virtues and =20
dangers in their use?  What can be achieved in the classroom with =20
digital materials which could not be achieved through traditional =20
print matter?
We have space in all these sessions.  If you are interested in taking =20
part in any of these sessions, please send, by 8 September:
For the panel: your name and brief resume, a few sentences on what you =20
would say as a panel member, and a completed participant identifier =20
form (PID!)
For the paper sessions: as usually required for Kalamazoo -- a 300 =20
word abstract and completed PID
You can download the PID form from http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/congress/sub=
missions.html#PIFIn the past, these have been excellent and stimulating sessions.  And =20
I will personally buy a beer or other beverage of choice to any =20
participant.  I recommend Bells Oberon (taste of summer, etc)
