a brief answer: I surely agree with 1 (moving the main site to the=20
Wordpress CMS) and have no big problems with 3 (eventually moving the=20
Journal to an open journal system), but I'm a little perplexed by 2,=20
i.e. closing the wiki altogether to replace it with a blog. Basically,=20
if we didn't manage to gather enough attention to make it a shared and=20
contributed-to resource, things wouldn't change much moving it to a=20
different technical platform; while on the purely technical side a=20
Wordpress site can end up as spam-infested as a wiki one.Merging the DM wiki with the Digital Classicist one make sense to me, or=20
making its editing login-based and try to revive it, otherwise perhaps=20
we should consider about shutting it down IMHO.All best,RIl 21/05/2014 14:05, Stokes, Peter ha scritto:

 of the Byelaws, and so again we need input from the Community for this.

Board, and so it has not been doing the job that we had hoped. Furthermore th=

antial help from James Cummings and Dan O'Donnell) is also proving in=
creasingly difficult to manage: it depends on the generosity of James and Dan=
 to host and administer, even adding new pages is not trivial, and it has nee=
ded a dramatic overhaul for some time but to do this requires much more time =
and effort than we have been able to manage. For all of these reasons, we pro=
pose the following:

al.

e not free to close the existing wiki without first changing the Byelaws. Eve=
n if we chose to keep the wiki, however, the Board feels that the Byelaws sho=
uld not lock us into using any single technology, and so they should be chang=
ed even if we keep the existing infrastructure. The details of the proposed c=
hanges to the Byelaws will be posted shortly as a separate e-mail and on the =
new website, but in essence we propose simply to replace the term 'wiki' with=
 'information resources' and to adapt the containing sentences accordingly.

by e-mail to the list for general discussion, or alternatively to board(a)dig=
italmedievalist.org or any members of the Board directly. The next Board meet=
