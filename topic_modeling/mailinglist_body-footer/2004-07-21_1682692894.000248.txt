> You can't run XSLT on SGML files, so this is not a very sensible 
question as phrased. However, migrating SGML to XML is very easily done 
using a nifty utility called osx, of which we have just done a windows 
port (sorry, but the Mac version is still a glint in someone else's 
eye). See the TEI SGML-XML migration workgroup's pages at 
http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/MI/ for general info on sgml to xml 
migration. I dont know that there's much difference between P1 and P4 as 
far as the OE Corpse is concerned.I have a very nice XML version of a small subset of the OE corpus with 
POS codes and lemmatization which I use as a testbed for Xaira, our new 
XML indexer. If anyone would like to have a play with that, I'd be 
pleased to make it available.> -dan
