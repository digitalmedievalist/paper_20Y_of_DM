Collana Fonti del diritto svizzero onlinehttp://www.ssrq-sds-fds.ch/online/Since 1898 the Swiss Lawyers Society edits a collection of law sources 
which had been created on Swiss territory up to 1798, the Collection of 
Swiss Law Sources. The Collection contains material from the early 
middle ages until early modern times (1798). Over 100 volumes, or more 
than 60,000 pages of source material and comments from all language 
regions of Switzerland have been published so far.In a project supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the 
Friedrich-Emil-Welti Foundation, the Law Sources Foundation has 
digitized all volumes published so far and makes them available online here.There are the following ways to access the Collection:* Via the catalog organized by cantons
* Via the search in the tables of contentsFor more extensive information please see the detailed description.Full-text searchOnly in the years to come the collection will be transformed into a 
digital edition. In addition to the images available online right now, 
the fulltext will be produced and encoded according to the TEI guidelines.Best, Torsten
