posed is whether (or how) electronic scholarship could become part of the
research components of our tenure requirements.  Peer review is the
cornerstone of qualifying research production and so my colleagues are
wondering if there are any established guidelines for peer review of
web-based projects,  or stand alone applications, that are not published by
a traditional publisher.  The issue is NOT about e-journals which retain the
standard peer review process, but rather projects or applications that do
not normally go through standard scholarly evaluations (although they often
undergo more severe critique by the Academy in an informal manner).Has anyone addressed this in their department or university?  I am simply
looking for some basic guidelines or sustained discussion on how to
integrate the kind of research we do on this list, and/or the methods to
demonstrate its comparative value to traditional forms of scholarship.Many thanks
Jim
