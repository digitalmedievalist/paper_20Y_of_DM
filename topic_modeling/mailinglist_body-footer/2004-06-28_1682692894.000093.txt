there's a TEI SIG (Special Interest Group) devoted to manuscript
transcription, this is the web site URL:http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/SIG/Manuscript/and this is where you go to subscribe to the mailing list:http://listserv.brown.edu/tei-ms-sig.htmlThe list has been very quiet lately, but please don't hesitate to bring
up the issues you want to discuss.Ciao-- Roberto Rosselli Del Turco	roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
