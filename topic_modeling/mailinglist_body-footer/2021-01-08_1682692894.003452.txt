Dear friends,I am very pleased to announce that the reconstruction of Otto Ege, "Fifty Ori=
ginal Leaves from Medieval Manuscripts" no. 46 that was undertaken by my stud=
ents at the Simmons University School of Library and Information Science this=
 fall is now online!https://fragmentarium.ms/overview/F-64n1If you have one of these Ege portfolios in your collection, you will find you=
r leaf no. 46 in this reconstruction (with the exception of three collections=
 from whom we hope to acquire images soon). Our analysis of the recovered por=
tion of the liturgy suggests that this Book of Hours was made for the Use of =
Rouen or Coutances, although because the evidence is incomplete we cannot say=
 this with absolute certainty (the recovered portion of the manuscript includ=
es the antiphon and chapter reading for None of the Hours of the Virgin as we=
ll as seven of nine Matins Responsories for the Office of the Dead, all of wh=
ich combine to suggest the Use). You may wish to update your metadata accordi=
ngly.This is the sixth Ege reconstruction undertaken by Simmons University student=
s in my annual course, "The Medieval Manuscript from Charlemagne to Gutenberg=
." You can read about these fragmentology projects and the Ege-related work b=
eing undertaken by other scholars in this (updated) blogpost:https://manuscriptroadtrip.wordpress.com/2019/07/14/manuscript-road-trip-frag=
mentology-in-the-wild/if you are interested in working on leaves in your own collection to determin=
e if they may have an Ege provenance, you may wish to refer to my Ege Field G=
uide, a shared folder in which you will find images of more than 100 dismembe=
red associated with Ege as well as a table that amalgamates codicological dat=
a from my own field work with data from Scott Gwara's monograph, Otto Ege's M=
anuscripts:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u2lbhr26pgz882p/AAAYahDHUEwPhQ097CFIwnK3a?dl=3D0The image filenames in this folder incorporate the Gwara handlist number, a s=
hort title, and the number of lines per page, to facilitate discoverability. =
For example, if you have a 27-line breviary leaf in your collection, searchin=
g for "27ll" in the Dropbox search box will result in four leaves, one of whi=
ch is from a breviary. Alternatively, you could search for "breviary," which =
returns eight leaves, one of which has 27 lines per page. You can then use th=
e data table to confirm if the dimensions and date/place of origin are a matc=
h for the leaf in question.Wishing you happy hunting and all the best in the New Year -Lisa--
