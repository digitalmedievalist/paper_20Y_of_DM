At the start of the session, we will look at philological problems in
Catullus, poems 26 (taking in the real estate market of ancient Rome)
and 102. We will move on to poems 61 (concentrating on lines 45=E2=80=9346,
90=E2=80=9396 and 215=E2=80=9316) and 62 (lines 22 and 54=E2=80=9356). Partic=
ipants may find it
useful to look at these texts in advance.
All best,
Paolo Monella and the VeDPH team
