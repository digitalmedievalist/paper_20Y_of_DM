Humanities Hackathon on editing Athenaeus and on the Reinvention of the Editi=
on in a Digital Space

Universität Leipzig (ULEI) & Deutsches Archäologisches Institut (DA=
I) BerlinCo-directors: Monica Berti - Marco Büchler - Gregory Crane - Bridget Alm=
asThe University of Leipzig will host a hackathon that addresses two basic task=
s. On the one hand, we will focus upon the challenges of creating a digital e=
dition for the Greek author Athenaeus, whose work cites more than a thousand =
earlier sources and is one of the major sources for lost works of Greek poetr=
y and prose. At the same time, we use the case Athenaeus to develop our under=
standing of to organize a truly born-digital edition, one that not only inclu=
des machine actionable citations and variant readings but also collations of =
multiple print editions, metrical analyses, named entity identification, ling=
uistic features such as morphology, syntax, word sense, and co-reference anal=
ysis, and alignment between the Greek original and one or more later translat=
ions.Request for Proposal=20Program
2 days: hands-on hackathon
1 day: eTRACES techniques (Usage of the Text re-use Webdebugger and the annot=
ation framework for text re-use)Registration Deadline

The Deipnosophists (=CE=94=CE=B5=CE=B9=CF=80=CE=BD=CE=BF=CF=83=CE=BF=CF=86=CE=
=B9=CF=83=CF=84=CE=B1=CE=AF, or =E2=80=9CBanquet of the Sophists=E2=80=9D) by=
 Athenaeus of Naucratis is a 3rd century AD fictitious account of several ban=
quet conversations on food, literature, and arts held in Rome by twenty-two l=
earned men. This complex and fascinating work is not only an erudite and lite=
rary encyclopedia of a myriad of curiosities about classical antiquity, but a=
lso an invaluable collection of quotations and text re-uses of ancient author=
s, ranging from Homer to tragic and comic poets and lost historians. Since th=
e large majority of the works cited by Athenaeus is nowadays lost, this compi=
lation is a sort of reference tool for every scholar of Greek theater, poetry=
, historiography, botany, zoology, and many other topics.Athenaeus' work is a mine of thousands of quotations, but we still la=
ck a comprehensive survey of its sources. The aim of this =E2=80=9Chumanities=
 hackathon=E2=80=9D is to provide a case study for drawing a spectrum of quot=
ing habits of classical authors and their attitude to text reuse. Athenaeus, =
in fact, shapes a library of forgotten authors, which goes beyond the limits =
of a physical building and becomes an intellectual space of human knowledge. =
By doing so, he is both a witness of the Hellenistic bibliographical methods =
and a forerunner of the modern concept of hypertext, where sequential reading=
 is substituted by hierarchical and logical connections among words and fragm=
ents of texts. Quantity, variety, and precision of Athenaeus' citatio=
ns make the Deipnosophists an excellent training ground for the development o=
f a digital system of reference linking for primary sources. Athenaeus=E2=80=
=99 standard citation includes (a) the name of the author with additional inf=
ormation like ethnic origin and literary category, (b) the title of the work,=
 and (c) the book number (e.g., Deipn. 2.71b). He often remembers the amount =
of papyrus scrolls of huge works (e.g., 6.229d-e; 6.249a), while distinguishi=
ng various editions of the same comedy (e.g., 1.29a; 4.171c; 6.247c; 7.299b; =
9.367f) and different titles of the same work (e.g., 1.4e).He also adds biographical information to identify homonymous authors and clas=
sify them according to literary genres, intellectual disciplines and schools =
(e.g., 1.13b; 6.234f; 9.387b). He provides chronological and historical indic=
ations to date authors (e.g., 10.453c; 13.599c), and he often copies the firs=
t lines of a work following a method that probably goes back to the Pinakes o=
f Callimachus (e.g., 1.4e; 3.85f; 8.342d; 5.209f; 13.573f-574a).Last but not least, the study of Athenaeus' =E2=80=9Ccitation system=
=E2=80=9D is also a great methodological contribution to the domain of =E2=80=
=9Cfragmentary literature=E2=80=9D, since one of the main concerns of this fi=
eld is the relation between the fragment (quotation) and its context of trans=
mission. Having this goal in mind, the textual analysis of the Deipnosophists=
 will make possible to enumerate a series of recurring patterns, which includ=
e a wide typology of textual reproductions and linguistic features helpful to=
 identify and classify hidden quotations of lost authors.Goals
This humanities hackathon is meant as a mini-course for training participants=
 in editing Athenaeus' work and his quotations, focusing on these top=
ics:marking up quotations and text re-uses in Athenaeus
annotating syntax and aligning translation of Athenaeus' text
using Athenaeus as a way to demonstrate the new Perseus SoSOL (http://sosol.p=
erseus.tufts.edu/sosol/)
Greek OCR on Athenaeus' editions
identifying and investigating quotations and text re-uses of Homer and Plato =
by Athenaeus
comparing the ways in which Athenaeus and Plutarch quotes Homer and Plato; th=
e goal is to use the computer to investigate how stable is an author'=
s re-use style in different sources
