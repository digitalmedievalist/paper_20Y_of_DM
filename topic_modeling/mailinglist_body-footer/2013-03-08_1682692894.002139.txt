the 13th ACM Document Engineering Symposium (DocEng) which will be held 
in Florence, Italy Sep 10-13 this year.DocEng provides an annual international forum for presentations and 
discussions on principles, tools and processes that improve our ability 
to create, manage and maintain documents. It is a nice friendly 
conference with around 70 attendees preceded by a day of workshops and 
tutorials. Initially DocEng had a fairly technical focus but in the last 
few years it has broadened scope to include important application areas 
including the digital humanities. The idea is not to compete with 
existing digital humanities publishing venues but rather to provide a 
quality venue for papers that describe techniques and applications of 
document processing within the digital humanities.Please think about submitting a paper to DocEng.More information including the CFP is available at 
http://www.doceng2013.orgBest regardsKim Marriott (Program Chair), Simone Marinai (Symposium Chair), Tamir 
Hassan (Publicity Chair)=====================
