machines, but not yet used it in a good, automated, manner.  What I'd
like to do is store my firefox and thunderbird profiles in it somehow,
and have them always up-to-date on whatever machine I'm using.  (i.e.
so mail filters and such are the same on all machines).  But I've not
had time to play with it enough.-james
