(www.archimedespalimpsest.org) is turning its attention to another
challenge. This is an extensive eighth or ninth century Syriac palimpsest
containing an extensive unidentified text, almost certainly medical in
nature. Again the manuscript is privately owned.We are currently undertaking study images, with a view to identifying the
text. After that has been done, the owner will determine whether or not to
proceed with a full scale conservation imaging and scholarly program.The images are currently being posted on the Image bank on the Archimedes
Palimpsest website:http://archimedespalimpsest.org/imagebank_frame1.htmlI would be most grateful for any comments, and if anyone thinks they can
help, they can either email me directly at wnoel(a)thewalters.org, or the can
join the digital imaging community site athttp://digitalarchimedes.ning.comThank you so very much.William Noel
