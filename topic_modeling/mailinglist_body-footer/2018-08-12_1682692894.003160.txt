Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitGreetings all,Long time-lurker and member, first email. I think. Anyway, as some of
you may know, I am the co-editor of The Heroic Age
(www.heroicage.org), online since 1999. Back then we started and tried
to shape some of the early digital medieval discussions through a
column that originally started as reviews of websites and projects.
Daniel O'Donnell came on our editorial board and also became the
columnist. Through permutations, personal life difficulties, career
changes etc....I dropped off the end of the earth, Daniel is way too
busy and have moved on in some way too, and my efforts to use personal
connections to find a new DM columnist for this issue have failed.So I'm looking for volunteers: a yearly column of approx 1000-2000
words on issues in Digital Medievalism, state of the field, new
projects, shaping the future of DM.....And if not volunteering, likely people who might be interested I could
contact? It just seems odd to me that the oldest online journal in our
field should not be also, at least a little bit, be talking about
Digital Medievalism.Many Thanks for your time and help!Larry Swain
