lanning to lockout faculty from their email accounts in the event a current l=
abour impasse proceeds to strike lockout.This is an irresponsible and reckless step for the administration of a resear=
ch university to take, as it both endangers ongoing research projects, and pl=
aces the health and safety of students, human subjects, and others at risk.Since this list has been hosted by the University for almost 20 years, there =
is a possibility that the list will be disrupted. I have updated my profile t=
o use my alternate email address (daniel.odonnell(a)gmail.com), but we are un=
sure as to whether or not the lockout will affect the operation of the list (=
the administration is compounding its recklessness by refusing to say which s=
ystems will be affected and how).If you would like to register a concern about the Administration's decision t=
o disrupt its faculty's professional communication and the operation of inter=
national research projects such as this, you can contact the president, Mike =
Mahon, at president(a)uleth.caThe union has indicated that it will not strike against research, precisely b=
ecause of the harm this poses to health, safety, and the long-term reputation=
 of the university. This means that I will be able to continue my participati=
on in this project without crossing its (virtual) picket lines.-dan-------------------------------------------The Board of Governors of the University of Lethbridge and my Faculty Associa=
tion are currently at an impasse in labour negotiations.The Administration recently has informed us that they intend to lock faculty =
out of their university email and other online services in the event of job a=
ction.To ensure continuity in the event the Board carries through on this reckless =
and irresponsible threat, please begin using the following alternate email fo=
r professional correspondence: daniel.odonnell(a)gmail.com. For union email, =
my usual address will remain operational: president(a)ulfa.ca.Note that the Faculty Association has indicated that it will not ask members =
to strike against research and other non-service or teaching duties in the ev=
ent of a strike or lockout. This is to avoid inflicting long-term damage on t=
he institution and to ensure faculty are able to fulfil their research, ethic=
al, and health and safety obligations.It also means that I will be able to continue with most correspondence even i=
n the event of Job Action without crossing our (virtual) picket lines.If you would like to register a concern about the University's decisi=
on to disrupt our professional communication, you can contact the president, =
Dr. Michael Mahon, at president(a)uleth.ca.I apologise for any inconvenience.[cid:1d00c3df-c04d-4149-98cf-d3f28974016e]--===============9032200033902835331==
