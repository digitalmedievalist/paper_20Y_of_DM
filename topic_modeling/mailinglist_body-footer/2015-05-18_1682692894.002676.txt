four positions to its Executive Board. Board positions are for two year
terms and incumbents may be re-elected (for a maximum of three terms in a
row). Members of the Board are responsible for the overall direction of the
organisation and leading the Digital Medievalist’s many projects and
programmes. This is a working board, and so it would be expected that you
are willing and able to commit time to helping Digital Medievalist
undertake some of its activities: the Board is currently organised with a
Director, a Deputy Director, a Journal Editor-in-Chief, Journal Associate
Editors, Conference Representatives, Website and News Feed Admins DM-L
Admins, Facebook Admin, Infrastructure/Technical Support, Returning
Officers for ElectionsFor further information about the Executive and Digital Medievalist more

the organisation’s mailing list, dm-l) and have made some demonstrable
contribution either to the DM project (e.g. to the mailing list, or the
