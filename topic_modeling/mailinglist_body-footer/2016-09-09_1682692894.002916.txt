tute of Manuscript Studies (SIMS<http://schoenberginstitute.org/>) at the Uni=
versity of Pennsylvania Libraries is pleased to announce the 9th Annual Lawre=
nce J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age. This ye=
ar's theme, "Reactions: Medieval/Modern," gives us space to explore the many =
and varied ways that people have reacted to, and acted upon, manuscripts from=
 the Middle Ages up to today. Reactions take many forms. They include the man=
ipulation of physical objects through, for example, the marking up of texts, =
addition of illustrations, the disbinding of books or rebinding of fragments,=
 as well as the manipulation of digital objects, thanks to new technologies i=
nvolved in digitization, ink and parchment analysis, virtual reconstruction, =
among many other processes. This symposium will also tackle how popular cultu=
re has reacted to manuscripts over time as witnessed by their use and appeara=
nce in books, games, films, and tattoo art. Our keynote speaker will be Miche=
lle P. Brown, Professor emerita of Medieval Manuscript Studies at the School =
of Advanced Study, University of London, and former Curator of Manuscripts at=
 the British Library.
