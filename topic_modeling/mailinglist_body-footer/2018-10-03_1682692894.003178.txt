University of Helsinki, Main Building, Small Hall (Pieni juhlasali), 4050
Fabianinkatu 33, Helsinki, FINLANDWelcome to the already traditional HELDIG Digital Humanities Summit! 
This year's Summit 2018 presents a picture of the Finnish Digital 
Humanities Infrastructure landscape, and contrasts it with international 
developments: Where are we now? What services are there available? How 
are they used, and what are the next steps ahead?To stimulate discussions, the day starts with the keynote 
"Infrastructures and Interfaces for Digital Humanities Research: Dutch 
Experiences and Expectations" by prof. Charles van den Heuvel from 
Huygens Institute and University of Amsterdam.After this follows presentations regarding international infrastructure 
collaborations, existing data, vocabulary, and ontology infrastructures, 
language technology services, and data infrastructures related to 
museums, libraries, and archives. There are 22 presentations of people 
representing 16 different organizations. In the end, bubbles and nibbles 
are served in a social networking event.Participation in HELDIG Digital Humanities Summit 2018 is open and free, 
but registration is required for catering.Programme and Registration:http://heldig.fi/summit-2018--
