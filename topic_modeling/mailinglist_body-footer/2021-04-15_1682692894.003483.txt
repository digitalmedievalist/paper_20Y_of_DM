st Webinar Repository <https://zenodo.org/communities/dmwr/?page=3D1&size=3D2=
0> (DMWR) is a great place to host your videos and other digital medievalist =
materials so that others can find and cite your work well after the conferenc=
e is over.Cataloguing a recording is a simple affair, and once the materials are gather=
ed, it should take no longer than 10 minutes. Each contribution requires thre=
e things:1. An MP4 file of the recording;
2. A transcript of the presentation in pdf format (automatically generated in=
 youtube, for example);
3. All standard bibliographic information to generate the citation and tag th=
e recording.Once accepted to the DMWR, the retrieval and citation of your work is facilit=
ated by the generation of a DOI and standard citation of the recorded present=
ation.Feel free to contact me with any questions, and keep those submissions coming!Laura Morreale
