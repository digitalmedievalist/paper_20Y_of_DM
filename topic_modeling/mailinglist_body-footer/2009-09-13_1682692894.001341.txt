To: 	SHARP-L(a)LISTSERV.INDIANA.EDUDear all,I'm collecting stories of reference works (or other large-scale
publishing projects) that have been interrupted in mid-course by
the rise of electronic publishing -- cases in which plans that
made sense when the project began have been scrapped because of
the transformative effects of the Internet.The first example to come to my mind was the third edition of the
Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature -- the whole was
commissioned some years ago, and vol. 4 (1800-1900), ed. Joanne
Shattuck, appeared in 1999, but the whole project was abandoned a
few years ago when CUP realized it would be impossible to sell
the hard-copy volumes, and couldn't think of a way to recover
costs on an on-line version.  All the contributors were released
from their contracts, the project has been dropped, and vol. 4
remains orphaned in libraries.Of course plenty of long-term projects have taken advantage of
new technologies.  When I first spoke with John Simpson about
OED3 in the '90s, he said the plan was still for a print version;
the most recent time I spoke with the OED lexicographers, they
said a print edition is unlikely -- still, the project goes on
apace, and it continues to get plenty of resources.  I'm more
interested in genuine interrputions, whether wholesale
abandonment, significant trimming of expectations, dropping of a
major institutional sponsor, or what-have-you.Have any of the major encyclopedia or dictionary publishers
officially called it quits? -- are decades-long works like the
Corpus vitrearum medii aevi still going ahead?I'll be able to make the most sense of English-language examples,
but there's no need to stick to them exclusively.
