website and wiki and moving us to Facebook. In fact that's a pretty
terrible idea. The suggestion was to have a DM page on FB, it would
just be another place to post news and announcements. There is,
however, already a DM page on FB that doesn't get much use (I use FB a
lot myself and have only visited the page a couple of times). In
addition, there is the pretty major hurdle that any page on FB can
only be used if you have an account on FB, and many people have many
good reasons for not having one. If we were to push FB too much I
would be concerned that DM discussions (especially) would start to
happen on FB and not on the list - which is where they belong.My own feeling is that the FB page is more likely to pull people onto
the list from FB, rather than the other way around. I have no doubt
that there are academics around the world, particularly at smaller
institutions, who have never heard of DM but may noodle their way to
the FB page. If we make a clear link from there to here (where the
action is) we're doing a lot more good than if we place a link to FB
from the DM web page. Everybody already knows about FB, right?Just my $.02 of course.DotOn Fri, Nov 6, 2009 at 6:24 PM, Peter Baker <psb6m(a)virginia.edu> wrote:
