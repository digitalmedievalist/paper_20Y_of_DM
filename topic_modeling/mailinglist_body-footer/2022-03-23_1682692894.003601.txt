The Digital Classicist London seminar invites proposals for the Summer 2022 s=
eries. We are looking for seminars on any aspect of the ancient or pre-coloni=
al worlds, that address innovative digital approaches to research, teaching, =
dissemination or engagement. Seminars that speak to the ancient world beyond =
Greco-Roman antiquity are especially welcome.Seminars will be held fortnightly through June and July in the Institute of C=
lassical Studies, Senate House, London, with the possibility for audience and=
 speakers to be present or remote (although we hope most speakers will be phy=
sically present in London, circumstances allowing). We have a small budget to=
 support travel for speakers within the UK.Please send an abstract of 300=E2=80=93500 words to <gabriel.bodard(a)sas.ac.=
uk<mailto:gabriel.bodard(a)sas.ac.uk>> (clearly marked Digital Classicist Lon=
don) by Sunday April 10, 2022.
