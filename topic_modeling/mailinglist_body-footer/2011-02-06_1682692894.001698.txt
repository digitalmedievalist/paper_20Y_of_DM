e's nothing Tortoise-like for OS X). The things I found with a Google search =
are the same things you will have found and I have no experience with them.But on (2), the happy news is that this Unicode navigator is built into the O=
S and is one of my favorite ways to browse Unicode. In System Preferences->La=
nguage & Text->Input Sources, simply check two boxes: "Keyboard & Character V=
iewer" at the top of the input method list on the left, and "Show Input menu =
in menu bar" at the bottom right. Then whenever you need a Unicode character,=
 select "Show Character Viewer" from the input menubar. By default it browses=
 by human-readable script/glyph categories that do not exactly correspond to =
the Unicode code tables, but changing the "View:" mode to "Code Tables" you c=
an see the familiar ranges like "20D0 Combining Mark for Symbols; 2100 Letter=
like Symbols" etc. You can also search by a string match against the long Uni=
code name, or by similar shapes.O.On Feb 6, 2011, at 3:02 PM, O'Donnell, Dan wrote:
