>         2nd Call for Abstracts
>         
>         Corpus Linguistics 2007 Colloquium: 
>         Towards a reference corpus of web genres
>         
>         
>         COLLOQUIUM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
>         
>         Genres of spoken and written texts are being intensively
>         studied from
>         various angles, e.g., communication studies, discourse
>         analysis,
>         computational linguistics, without arriving at a generally
>         accepted
>         definition. The web is new, so it is not clear how to apply
>         traditional
>         notions of genre to web pages. In this colloquium we would
>         like collect
>         submissions that study characteristics of web genres with
>         respect to
>         traditional paper genres represented in electronic corpora
>         like the BNC. 
>          
>         Web documents are often characterised by a high level of genre
>         hybridism,
>         by a fragmentation of textuality across several documents, by
>         the impact of
>         technical features such as hyperlinking, posting facilities
>         and
>         multi-authoring. The web is a huge reservoir of documents that
>         can be
>         easily mined for building all sorts of corpora with many
>         collections being
>         built according to subjective criteria for
>         corpus composition, genre annotation, genre representativeness
>         and genre
>         granularity. In this colloquium we would like to invite
>         submissions
>         contributing to a reference corpus of web genres. The main
>         goal of the
>         colloquium is to draw up an initial list of characteristics
>         and
>         requirements for building, annotating and evaluation reference
>         corpora of
>         web genres. For instance:
>          
>         * To what extent should genre hybridism and authorial
>         creativity be
>         represented in a genre collection? These two phenomena appear
>         to be very 
>         common on the web.
>         
>         * To what extent is it possible to include ''emerging
>         genres'', i.e.,
>         genres still in a transitional phase in genre evolution? The
>         web is
>         currently thriving with emerging genres.
>         
>         * How many granularities of the unit of analysis should be
>         included? Only
>         genres representing web sites? Only genre representing web
>         pages? Both? 
>         
>         * What ''format'' should be used to store these units in a
>         collection
>         (e.g., a database-like form, DOM trees, a net of graphs, in
>         HTML format, in
>         a text-only version, with or without embedded images, removing
>         boilerplate
>         components)?
>         
>         * What level of genre granularity and similarity should be
>         applied in the
>         reference corpus? Genre collections often show different
>         levels of  
>         granularity, including genres and super-genres. Should similar
>         genres, such
>         as ''tutorial'' and ''how-to'', be accounted for separately? 
>          
>         TOPICS:
>          
>         The topics of interest include but are not limited to:
>         
>         - Text theory for the development of web corpora
>         - Modelling corpora of web genres
>         - Innovative genre classification schemes accounting for
>         multi-genre and
>         no-genre web documents
>         - Modelling genre annotation scheme for web documents

>         - Creating comparable corpora of web genre 
>         - Automatic genre classification vs. human genre

>         - How to evaluate the corpus: using statistical measures,

>         linguists, librarians, or web users?
>          
>         PARTICIPATION
>         
>         The aim of this colloquium, the first ever organized on this
>         topic, is to
>         bring together researchers from different communities such as
>         corpus
>         linguistics, genre analysis, digital genre community,
>         computational
>         linguistics, and information retrieval in order to promote the
>         discussion
>         and development of new ideas and methods to create new corpora
>         for language
>         studies and as evaluation resources.
