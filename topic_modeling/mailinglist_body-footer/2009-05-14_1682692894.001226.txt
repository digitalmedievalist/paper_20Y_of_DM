Subject: [dm-l] John of Gaunt (ot)Hello list,My brother has asked if I can recommend a good book about John of
Gaunt, he's out of my area and I'm not on any medieval history lists
but perhaps there is someone here on DM who can help. He said he's
been reading something by Norman Cantor (who writes a lot of popular
medieval history) but he's finding it less than adequate. He reads
massive amounts about history so I'd be quite comfortable recommending
him something directed at a scholarly (as opposed to a popular)
audience. He just wants to learn about John of Gaunt.Thanks for any suggestions.Dot--
