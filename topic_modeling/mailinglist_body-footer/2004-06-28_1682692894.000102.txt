descriptions: MASTER (**Manuscript Access through Standards for 
Electronic Records). The MASTER-DTD has been developed in close 
cooperation with TEI and therefore it may be to general for your 
purposes as well, but better have a look at it:http://www.cta.dmu.ac.uk/projects/master/In the digitization project CEEC (Codices Electronici Ecclesiae 
Coloniensis, www.ceec.uni-koeln.de) we adjusted the MASTER-DTD to our 
needs and therefore have slightly more elements/attributes for the 
physical description.Within the project CEEC a colleague of mine, Patrick Sahle, developed a 
tool for palaeographical analysis. This includes an inchoate DTD, which 
because of the nature of the tool is meant only to cover measures and 
other physical characteristics. Unfortunately, the documentation is 
available only in German.Greetings, Torsten Schassan
