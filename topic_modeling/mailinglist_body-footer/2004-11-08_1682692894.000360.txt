Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableHello all,1) Introductions?	Our list is now at 214 members, which seems a decent number. When we=20
first began, it seemed like a waste of bandwidth to ask everybody to=20
introduce themselves. Now that we are a community and the new membership=20
rate has slowed down, I was wondering whether we should suggest that new=20
members introduce themselves to the list on the sign up page.=20
Suggestions or comments? We probably get one new member every ten days=20
(there is also some churning and attrition).
2) Project descriptions?
	I was also wondering if we couldn't also use the wiki to allow members=20
to write small project descriptions.
	As some of you will know from our original description of the=20
(forthcoming) journal, we will be publishing refereed project reports.=20
This will be a forum that will allow you write descriptions of work you=20
have been up to and get institutional credit for it (i.e. in terms of=20
refereed publications). The journal is an excellent forum for publishing=20
distinctive research on aspects of your project, and especially work=20
that might be difficult (due to its technical nature perhaps) to publish=20
elsewhere: before xsl was really commonly supported (in 1998), for=20
example, I wrote a technical note describing how Multidoc Stylesheets=20
could be used to transform SGML to HTML (a method I still use,=20
horrors!). Ultimately I gave it to the engineers at Citec, since I=20
couldn't really find anywhere to publish it. That might have been=20
something for a journal like DM.
	Not everything that is interesting about a project is necessarily=20
significant enough to be refereed, however--and it is not clear that we=20
are well served by restricting publication solely to "refereeable"=20
publications. As a community of practice, the Digital Medievalist=20
Project is dedicated to informal sharing of information about practice=20
as well. If I'm working on a project and am using MSWord to XML=20
conversion, for example, it might be convenient to search for other=20
projects that are using similar processes. Or if I'm working on an=20
edition of an Old English or Middle Dutch text, I might like to know who=20
else is working with similar languages so I can avoid reinventing the wheel.
	It seems to me that the Wiki might be an excellent place for publishing=20
such information or keeping track of others in my field. It is=20
searchable, tied to an RSS server=20
<http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php?title=3DSpecial:Recentchanges&feed=
=3Drss>,=20
and freely editable. We could easily use it as a simple forum for=20
publicising what we are working on in a way that allows people to=20
discover us in unexpected ways.
	What do people think? We could easily set up a "Projects" table of=20
contents page to which you could add a link to a separate wiki entry on=20
your project. We could established recommended guidelines for what we'd=20
like to see in a basic project report (though there wouldn't really any=20
mechanism for enforcing this). The most important thing from our,=20
perspective, however would be that it would allow us to let everybody=20
else in the community know what we are up to.
	Any suggestions or comments? I thought before making up a "project"=20
wiki page, I'd throw the idea out to see if there were any better=20
suggestions (I think our idea of a wiki-based best practice primer is=20
going to need a more firm editorial hand than I'd originally thought,=20
for example). If there aren't, we'll make it a real invitation by the=20
end of the week.-dan
