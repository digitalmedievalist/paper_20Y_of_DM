Drive and Google Docs with teams frequently.  They have proven to be=20
invaluable tools.  I am not sure what software you are using to edit=20
your documents, but Google Docs records history of every single change=20
and you can switch between "Edit" and "Suggest Edit" mode, the latter is=20
extremely useful with multiple editor.  I am not sure if Drive, just as=20
a file share, will version documents for you.  One aspect of Drive that=20
doesn't work well at all is "Offline" mode.  I have often 'pinned' a=20
document to my device before embarking on a long flight only to find,=20
when I attempt to open the document, an error stating, "no valid=20
internet connection."  Drives me crazy.Anyway, my 2c.Troy
