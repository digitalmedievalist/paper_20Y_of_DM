the developer doesn't dare make a choice himself. Good user interface
design often simply means choosing sensible defaults, and not bothering
the user with the notion of different stylesheets for different, non
standard complying, browsers. In an ideal world, at least ... :)I've heard that MS finally decided to revive the IE development group,
and that the main developer has shown some willingness to listen to
suggestions, provided that they're not as generic as "better compliance
to web standards": I wonder why he chose this particular example! Ciao-- Roberto Rosselli Del Turco	roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
