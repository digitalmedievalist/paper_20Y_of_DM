    I'm helping a graduate student with a quick survey: does anybody 
know of CD-ROM editions with full text searching of the entire disk? 
I've looked through the editions I have, and I'm not sure any of the 
ones I own have mechanisms for full text searching of all the files on 
the disk. What she is looking for are texts that produce Google like 
results, limited solely to the contents of the disk in question, from a 
text search on CD-ROM. We are of course aware of the new Google beta 
disk search, and realise that things like HT/dig allow one to do this 
kind of searching on-line.
    Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
