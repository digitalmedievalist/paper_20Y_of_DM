Illuminated Manuscripts in Boston Collections* is now live:http://BeyondWords2016.orgHover over "Catalog" and select "Online" to access the database.The online catalogue allows for searching by keyword and catalogue
number as well as upper and lower date limits, and provides browse lists
for illuminator, scribe, and place of production. Each of the 249 object
records includes at least one image and two-thirds of the records link
to  a  full-facsimile Mirador manifest or  an  institutional record. The
database will be updated as more images become available to us, and full-
text descriptions will be uploaded for many of the manuscripts in the
coming months.To access the catalogue and learn more about Beyond Words, please visit
our website: http://BeyondWords2016.org. There you will find information
about each of the three exhibition venues, registration and a
preliminary program for the Beyond Words symposium (Nov. 3-5), a
calendar of public programming, and more. On Twitter, find us
@BeyondWords2016.With regards,The Beyond Words curatorial team:Jeffrey F. Hamburger
