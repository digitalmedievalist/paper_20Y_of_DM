RefWorks and encouraging faculty and staff to use it. I am 
embarrassed to say that it is my first citation database (I 
am a true medievalist in many ways!) so I can't compare it 
to other programs. I can tell you about it, though. Here are the advantages:
1. it's free (but only through my university)
2. it's online and thus I can access my citations from home 
or office. And If my computer crashes, I still have the 
database tucked away on a server.
3. it's flexible with regards to citation style (has 
hundreds, it seems) and a nice system for filing citations 
in folders
4. this is neat--you can search library catalogues around 
the world and import citations from them.
Here are the disavangates:
1. Some databases, such as Brepol's medieval bibliography, 
are not set up to export to RefWorks. Of course, perhaps I 
have just not figured out how to do it.For more info, visit the help pages created by my Library
