Internet Archive (proprietors of the Wayback Machine) is universally 
interested in what is and was on the Internet, whether incunabula or 
not, and one can upload all kinds of material--text, images, audio, 
video. The "item creation" page is at http://www.archive.org/create/ 
Archive has racks of terabyte boxes--that is, plenty of space. The trick 
is to identify the material properly so that it can be located, if 
necessary, by filename alone (the format is 
http://www.archive.org/details/YourIdentifierName). As at most digital 
libraries or repositories, cataloging info or metadata may be sparse 
and, even then, not readily findable. Longterm accessibility is a big 
problem if the material exists but can't be located.Archive suggests going to Creative Commons and using the ccPublisher 
tool to add a license to the material. (In brief, "Creative Commons 
defines the spectrum of possibilities between full copyright — all 
rights reserved — and the public domain — no rights reserved. [The] 
licenses help you keep your copyright while inviting certain uses of 
your work — a 'some rights reserved' copyright.")

source, you can generally pass it along as such. But if, say, you have a 
translation or transcription in a WordStar doc acquired from a colleague 
now dead, some investigation and negotiation would be in order. All such 
resource recovery efforts are praiseworthy!Cheers,
