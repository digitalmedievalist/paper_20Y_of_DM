in Sarajevo September 11-13 and are hoping to meet with prospective members
and partners. MESA is a federation of electronic projects in the field of
medieval studies that offers aggregated searching of digital content and
peer review of scholarly projects. We partner with scholars working on
electronic projects, librarians and archivists who have digitized
collections of medieval materials, publishers, and more. We will have a
booth set up in the Market Place and are also happy to schedule one-on-one
meetings with anyone who is interested in learning more about us or finding
out how their projects might participate in MESA. Let us know if you would
like to schedule a meeting - you may contact us directly at mesamedieval[at]
