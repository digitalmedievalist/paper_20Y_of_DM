the introductory material to various digital editions. I like the stuff on
the Electronic Beowulf; things like the "1993 Prospectus" give a good
insight into what the world of digitization was like at the beginning, even
if lines like these now sound delightfully archaic:"The equipment we are using to capture the images is the Roche/Kontron
ProgRes 3012 digital camera, which can scan any text, from a letter or a
word to an entire page, at 2000 x 3000 pixels in 24-bit color. The resulting
images at this maximum resolution are enormous, about 21-25 MB, and tax the
capabilities of the biggest machines. Three or four images - three or four
letters or words if that is what we are scanning - will fill up an 88 MB
hard disk, and we have found that no single image of this size can be
processed in real time without at least 64 MB of RAM."Doug

scans to DjVu. Here are some links:      http://djvu.org/
