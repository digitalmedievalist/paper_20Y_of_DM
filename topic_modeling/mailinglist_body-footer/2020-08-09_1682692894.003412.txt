collaborative development of durable, reusable, shared resources for
research and learning in the field of digital and public humanities. Its
disciplinary domains include Digital Textual Scholarship, Digital and
Public Art History, Digital and Public History, Digital Cultural
Heritage and Digital and Public Archaeology.=E2=80=93=E2=80=93=E2=80=93=E2=80=93=E2=80=93=E2=80=93=E2=80=93=E2=80=93=E2=

magaz=C3=A9n is looking for contributors to its 2020 inaugural volume
entitled =E2=80=9CFusions=E2=80=9D, which will devote also the second semestr=
al issue of
the journal to the intertwining landscape emerging from the recent
development of digital and public humanities. As a matter of fact, in
the last two decades much effort was placed in defining separate
disciplinary fields, in order to canonise and validate the use of
digital methodologies or public approaches in the specific subsets of
the humanities. However, evidence suggests that digital and public
challenges facing singular disciplines are actually common to the entire
field of the humanities, thus favouring a cross-disciplinary approach
rather than thematic isolation. Indeed, the impact of digitisation and
public involvement offered a unique opportunity to the humanities: a
window for experimentation with merged methodologies, blended sharing
practices, joined representation modes, interpenetrated material
research. In this process new actors, factors and agents emerged that
are about to consolidate today's landscape in the digital and public
humanities, although still on the search for standards and best
practices that could suit the entire field.
For its inaugural volume magaz=C3=A9n is set to examine in two semestral
issues (Summer 2020 and Fall 2020) the concept of =E2=80=9Cfusions=E2=80=9D a=
s the very
backbone of recent developments in the realm of digital and public
humanities. Scholars are particularly invited to submit contributions
that span from theoretical debates to methodological reflections, also
comprising the examination of particular case studies.
