on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition, we organise a competition focussed
on (Latin) Medieval Scripts, as described here: ICFHR2016 Competition on
the Classification of Medieval Handwritings in Latin Script | Écriture
médiévale & numérique <http://oriflamms.hypotheses.org/1388>The challenge for Computer Scientists is to identify correctly the main
script types (e.g. uncial, caroline, textualis, humanistic), having two
aims in mind: 1) automated cataloguing in large digital libraries, not only
for whole volumes, but even at a page level; 2) preparing text recognition.
As many of you, we are well aware that the given categories are far from
representing the complexity and the dynamics, but it is a first step.Best regards,
Dominique Stutzmann, Marlène Helias-Baron, Florence Cloppet, Véronique
