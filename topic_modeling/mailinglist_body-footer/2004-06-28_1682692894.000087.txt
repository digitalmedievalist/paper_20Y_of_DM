orking on DTD and tool (called "DucType") for paleographical description. Bri=
efly, it will enable to editor to view a manuscript image alongside a transcr=
ipt, and encode paleographical descriptions using a simple template interface=
. It's still under development, although Kevin Kiernan, PI on the projects, h=
as shown several demonstrations, including one at Kzoo in May.=20Look for our forthcoming article in Literary and Linguistic Computing (the pr=
oceedings from last year's ACH/ALLC meeting - July or August 2004). We also h=
ave a short article coming out in the July DigiCULT Newsletter [http://www.di=
gicult.info/pages/index.php] that gives a bit of history and briefly describe=
s DucType and our other editing tools.=20You can find out more on our project websites:Electronic Boethius - http://beowulf.engl.uky.edu/~kiernan/eBoethius/inlad.htm
