5th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the
Digital Age
November 16-17, 2012Taxonomies of KnowledgeIn partnership with the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of
Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania Libraries are pleased to
announce the 5th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript
Studies in the Digital Age. This year's symposium considers the role of the
manuscript in organizing and classifying knowledge. Like today's electronic
databases, the medieval manuscript helped readers access, process, and
analyze the information contained within the covers of a book. The papers
presented at this symposium will examine this aspect of the manuscript book
through a variety of topics, including the place of the medieval library in
manuscript culture, the rise and fall of the 12th-century commentary
tradition, diagrams, devotional practice, poetics, and the organization and
use of encyclopedias and lexicons.Participants include:    *     Katharine Breen, Northwestern University
    *     Mary Franklin-Brown, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities
    *     Vincent Gillespie, University of Oxford
    *     Alfred Hiatt, Queen Mary, University of London
    *     William Noel, University of Pennsylvania
    *     Eric Ramirez-Weaver, University of Virginia
    *     Lesley Smith, University of Oxford
    *     Peter Stallybrass, University of Pennsylvania
    *     Emily Steiner, University of Pennsylvania
