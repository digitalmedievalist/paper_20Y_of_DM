g(a)uleth.ca>.hi digital medievalists!I have lurked on your site for many years with pleasure.Now I have had a chat with a friend who is doing a translation of a Merovingi=
an saint's life and who wonders if there is any such thing in existence as a =
digital Biblical concordance. This would allow the user to compare their elec=
tronic text of interest with the text of the Vulgate (or vetus Latina.. why n=
ot) and have returned a list of words in their text which are in the Latin Bi=
ble, or CONVERSELY which are NOT in the Latin Bible.It seems that such a useful tool
 should already exist and I thought I might ask you all if you know of this b=
eing in existence or of an expert to consult with.THANK you in advance for any help you might be able to give me!
