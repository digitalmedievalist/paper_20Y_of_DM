so I want to see if you all have any suggestions for my next query...Let's say that I'm interested in creating an online index to Latin
dictionaries. My index will include lemmata drawn from many different
lexica, in print and out of print. Just the lemmata - not the
dictionary entries. What are the copyright implications? Does a lemma
in a dictionary count as "intellectual property"? Does reprinting the
entire list of lemmata from a dictionary count as infringement?Or do I really need to talk to a lawyer?Thanks,
Dot--
