is launching a beta version of its manuscript database today. The database co=
llects information on all surviving and identified early medieval manuscripts=
 transmitting the text of the Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville. If you wonde=
r how many manuscripts are we talking about, the Isidore number is 461 at the=
 moment (and counting!).You can enter the database and learn more about the project at: innovatingkno=
wledge.nl<http://innovatingknowledge.nl/>.Since the database is just a beta version and the project is still running fo=
r a few months, the project team would appreciate your feedback, which you ca=
n also provide through the Innovating Knowledge website. Any suggestions of n=
ew manuscripts to be included, or of corrections of and additions to manuscri=
pt records are also be appreciated.With kind regards,Evina Steinova
