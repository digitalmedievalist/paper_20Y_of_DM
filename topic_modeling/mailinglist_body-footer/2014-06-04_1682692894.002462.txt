On Cognition and the Digital in the Study of Ancient Textual ArtefactsALL WELCOME
Scholars studying Ancient Textual Artefacts endeavour to create 
knowledge through the decipherment, transcription, transliteration, 
edition, commentary, and contextualization of textual artefacts, thereby 
transforming data and information into knowledge and meaning.  Their 
task is hence intrinsically interpretative, and relies heavily on the 
mobilization of both perceptual and conceptual cognitive processes. This 
talk will present a number of conceptual and perceptual processes that 
were identified through ethnographic studies of scholars at work and 
linked to the cognitive sciences literature. Some show embodied 
cognition at work, others show the role of unconscious knowledge in the 
act of interpretation of Ancient Textual Artefacts.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.See the full programme for this summer's seminars at
