Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitAt Kalamazoo last year, I heard a discussion of a project that was
planning to use an virtual commons--i.e. a place where users could
contribute to the development of the project through shared annotation,
textual development, and the like (I think they actually described it as
a piazza. As I understood the idea, and in discussion at the Digital
Medievalist business meeting a couple of people mentioned similar
proposal, the idea was to build what we might now think of as adding
wiki-like capabilities to a larger, unified, scholarly project.Does anybody know of any scholarly projects that have actually
implemented such virtual piazza-type interaction? I'm interested in
projects that allows arbitrary users to contribute to the content,
either with or without refereeing.-d--===============7479892086625554445==--
