Initiative will be convening during the TEI Member's Meeting in
November. The TEI Guidelines are used to encode many diverse,
graphically rich documents, including illuminated manuscripts,
laboratory notebooks, art books, children's illustrated books, comics
and graphic novels, and so on.  These types of graphically rich
documents present special concerns, considerations, and challenges,
both conceptually at the encoding level and technically at the
transformation, presentation, and publishing layers of digital
document development.The purpose of this SIG will be to discuss, develop, and document
various strategies and best practices for implementing the digital
facsimile structures available in TEI P5, especially as relates
tovgraphically rich texts, and for developing methods to extend the
TEI when existing structures are not suitable.We are organizing a session of graphics-focused papers for the
member's meeting as well. If you would like to participate, please
contact Dot Porter <dporter(a)uky.edu> by April 25. Details about the
member's meeting at
http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/cocoon/tei2008/index.html.Discussions leading up to the meeting in November will be held on the
SIG listserv. To join the listserv, visit
