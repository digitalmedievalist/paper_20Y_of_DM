a CD is loaded (I am assuming that by "loaded" you mean simply making the 
CD accessible - ie, just putting it in the drive). At the very least I 
would want to notify the user and provide the option of not doing it.Second, the procedure for installing fonts is very different on the various 
operating systems, and so would require an installer for each target 
system. For example, on Windows you only need to copy the appropriate files 
to the Font folder (usually \windows\fonts); on Mac you (I think) use a 
control panel. I very much doubt that you could have a single installer 
that would work for all systems.Third, what happens when a CD is loaded is different on each system; for 
example, Windows (if enabled to do so) executes a specific file on the CD 
(usually called AutoRun), which contains instructions on what to do next 
(which can be most anything - display an option menu, run an installer, 
load a web page, etc.). I don't know how it works on Mac and Linux, but I 
doubt it is the same. Once again, you would probably need a separate 
process for each system.In short, you would probably need a way to detect the type of system the CD 
is being loaded on, and react accordingly to install the fonts. I don't 
know of any such existing facility, and I suspect it would not be easy to do.David
