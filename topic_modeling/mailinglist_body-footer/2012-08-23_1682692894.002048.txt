Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDan Mosser -I want to second the other Dan's request. I've toyed around with aggregating =
IMEV and LALME data for fully-digitized manuscripts, and also discussed using=
 Google maps (with varying degrees of location specificity) for those entries=
 with some people here on campus.  Originally, I had high hopes for aggregati=
ng data from Edinburgh's e-LALME site, which had promised a release last year=
. The project seems to still be delayed, unfortunately, otherwise one could u=
se proper xml ID's for LPs and avoid duplicating large amounts of work.Kind regards,
Matthew

Subject: [dm-l] Geospatial/Geodetic mapping of MSSThanks to all who have replied (off list, I think) to my query about linguist=
ic mapping of Middle English MSS.Dan O'Donnell asked for a sample of the markup. The DIMEV is an xml-based pro=
ject. I haven't added mapping information as yet, but here is a straightforwa=
rd example of the MS file with the <lang> entry:<item xml:id=3D"PhilUPEng8">
       <loc>Philadelphia</loc>
       <repos>University of Pennsylvania</repos>
       <desc>MS Codex 218 [formerly Eng. 8; <i>olim</i> Stonor Park]</desc>
       <lang><biblio key=3D"LALME">LALME</biblio> LP 559 (<place country=3D"E=
ngland" county=3D"Isle of Ely">Ely</place>: Hand A, ff. 1-146v); LP 551 (<pla=
ce country=3D"England" county=3D"Lincolnshire">Lincs</place>:
           Hand B, ff. 147-195v)</lang>
   </item>The LALME and LAEME keys are linked to full entries in the bibliography. I'm =
waiting for my coder to fit some time in for the style-sheet updates for this=
 information.Since I haven't, as yet, constructed a tagging structure for the mapping coor=
dinates, I'm happy to have suggestions. Dan mentioned KML and Google maps, an=
d that might be an easy way to proceed.=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=9C=CB=
