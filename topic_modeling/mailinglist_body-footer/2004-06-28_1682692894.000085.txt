from the current generation of our Hot Potatoes authoring tools is 
standards-compliant XHTML 1.1, CSS and JavaScript, and these highly complex 
and interactive pages work on IE6, Mozilla/Firefox, Opera 7.5+ and Safari. 
The ONLY browser-sniffing code we use these days concerns areas where the 
standards are not clear (such as how to calculate the size of the browser 
window viewport or document area), and this is abstracted into a couple of 
common JavaScript functions. In previous versions of our software, up to 
one third of the code in the pages was concerned with browser-sniffing and 
branching to handle relatively simple functionality such as drag-and-drop. 
We no longer need to waste all that work.There's no doubt in my mind that the current generation of browsers is the 
most broadly standards-compliant set we have ever been able to write for, 
and life for Web developers has consequently never been better; we have a 
pretty rich feature set, a working DOM implementation with good APIs, and 
stable long-term standards to write to. I'd love to have everything CSS3 
promises (or even the last few bits of CSS2 that still aren't supported), 
but what we have is enough to create rich, interactive documents and 
Websites which fully validate and will not break in the future. There's no 
need for the misery of Java applets either, unless you need to save and 
load files locally or something like that.One shameful admission -- in our JavaScript DOM code we do use "innerHTML", 
a Microsoft-spawned property which is not part of the W3C DOM API, but 
which is supported by all browsers, and which, to be frank, is a pretty 
good idea that saves a lot of code. If it didn't exist, we'd have to write 
a similar function ourselves (not hard, but time-consuming and surely 
slower than the native browser implementations).My 2 cents,
Martin
