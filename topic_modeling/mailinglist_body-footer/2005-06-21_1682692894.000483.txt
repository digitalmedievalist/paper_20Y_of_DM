	As some of you know, I write a column on electonica medievalia for
Heroic Age, a superb online journal in its 8th year.
	My next column is due soon, and while I was originally planning to
write on TEI P5, something that came up on Medtext has sat in my head
for the last several weeks: it was an email from Judith Bolton Halloway
(I think it was) that described markup languages and protocols like the
TEI as obsolete in the face of high quality manuscript facsimiles (I'm
paraphrasing and so might not have it exactly right).
	What I'm wondering is not so much whether markup languages are obsolete
(that's demonstrably not true in a technical sense), but whether there
is an easy argument that they are worth it for a low tech humanities
oriented person to learn. I'm thinking here of the issues raised in
Peter Robinson's article in the premier issue of DM, various talks I've
given or heard at conferences.
	So here's a question: when is it worth it to devote time to learning a
complex language like TEI--or any other standards based structural
language or computer skill (and when is it not)? What should one expect
to get out of going to the trouble of learning them? And what do you
lose by (or simply what is the cost of) doing so?
	I suppose this might be a question for Humanist, but I thought I'd try
it out here given the medieval focus of HA. I'm not (necessarily)
looking for answers to my topic for my column, but I'm interested in
mulling the question over with others before I set cursor to screen.
