editing of papyrological and epigraphic texts, at the Institute of
Classical Studies, London, April 3â€“7, 2017. The workshop will be taught by
Gabriel Bodard and Lucia Vannini (ICS) and Simona Stoyanova (KCL). There
will be no charge for the workshop, but participants should arrange their
own travel and accommodation.EpiDoc (epidoc.sf.net) is a community of practice and guidance for using
TEI XML for the encoding of inscriptions, papyri and other ancient texts.
It has been used to publish digital projects including Inscriptions of
Aphrodisias and Tripolitania, Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri, Digital
Corpus of Literary Papyri, and EAGLE Europeana Project. The workshop will
introduce participants to the basics of XML markup and give hands-on
experience of tagging textual features and object descriptions, identifying
and linking to external person and place authorities, and use of the online
Papyrological Editor tool.The workshop will assume knowledge of papyrology or epigraphy; Greek, Latin
or another ancient language; and the Leiden Conventions. No technical
skills are required, and scholars of all levels, from students to
professors, are welcome. To apply, please email gabriel.bodard(a)sas.ac.uk
with a brief description of your background and reason for application, by
February 28, 2017.
All the best,
Simona--
