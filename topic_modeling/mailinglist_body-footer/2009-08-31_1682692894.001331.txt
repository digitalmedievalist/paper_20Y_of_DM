resources, but I'm also interested in how scholars use these
resources, both for research and in the classroom. My MSLS thesis was
based on a survey of "medievalists' use of electronic resources," but
that's been almost nine years ago. It's probably time for a more
formal revisiting of the topic but until then I think I'll see if I
can satisfy my curiosity here. My own day-to-day work focuses on the
creation of resources, but of course creation without use is useless
(arguably?).So, out of scholarly curiosity, what is your favorite
digital/electronic/online resource (or type of resource), and why?Dot--
