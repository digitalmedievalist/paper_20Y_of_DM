University of Cambridge, Faculty of English, 30 June - 2 July 2014
Under the auspices of the Centre for Material Texts
Writing Britain is a biennial event which aims to draw on a range of approach=
es and perspectives to exchange ideas about manuscript studies, material cult=
ure, multilingualism in texts and books, book history, readers, audience and =
scribes across the medieval period. The 2014 iteration of the Writing Britain=
 Conference will take place in the English Faculty at the University of Cambr=
idge under the auspices of the Centre for Material Texts. Some of the topics =
which we are keen to explore are literary and non-literary agencies and their=
 significance and/or relevance in the medieval period across British medieval=
 written culture in English, French, Latin, Norse and the Celtic languages. M=
ore broadly, we are interested in other questions such as: How did local writ=
ers, compilers and readers use writing to inscribe regional identity within b=
roader conventions or, on the other hand, impress 'universal' practices and c=
onstructs on local populations? What were the different markets for books? Ca=
n we characterize their developments and differences? What new or existing me=
thodologies can be employed to localise texts and books across Britain? What =
is the role of the Digital Humanities in the study of medieval book culture?Plenary speakers: Jonathan Wilcox (University of Iowa), Richard Beadle (Unive=
rsity of Cambridge) and Simon Horobin (University of Oxford)
We welcome proposals from scholars working on any aspects of British medieval=
 written culture up to 1500. Please visit our conference web site in order to=
 submit an abstract (300 words or fewer) for a twenty-minute paper. Please se=
nd your abstract by 20 February 2014. Abstracts from postgraduate students ar=
e welcome and graduate rates will be provided. For further information please=
 visit the website where contact details of the organisers will also be avail=
able.=20Conference website:=20www2.le.ac.uk/departments/english/news/conferences/writing_britain
