dertake research and consultation towards the implementation of a permanent D=
igital Humanities association for the UK and Ireland. A key focus for the net=
work is the question of career development in Digital Humanities, and the opt=
ions that are available to postgraduate students, early career researchers, a=
nd aspiring research software engineers (RSEs) in particular. An opening pane=
l session will present the experiences of digital humanists who have gone on =
to a wide variety of careers, from academia to the creative industries, cultu=
ral heritage and the technology sector. This will be followed by an open disc=
ussion exploring the kinds of support and guidance that would make a differen=
ce to the career paths of Digital Humanities ECRs and RSEs, including industr=
y placements, training, mentoring and advocacy. This conversation will feed i=
nto a discussion paper on next-generation careers in and from Digital Humanit=
ies.Programme14.00-14.05 Welcome14.05-15.35 Panel One (Chair: Justin Tonra, NUI Galway)  *   Karolina Badzmierowska (Noho Ltd.)
