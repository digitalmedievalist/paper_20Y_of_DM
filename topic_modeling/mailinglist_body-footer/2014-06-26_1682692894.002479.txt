Subject: CFP: Did You Read That? Art Editing on the Web (New York, 
11-15 Feb 2015)New York, CAA Annual Conference, February 11 - 14, 2015
Deadline: Jul 31, 2014Sponsored by the Association of Art Editors, the session "Did You Read 
That? Art Editing on the Web" will explore the current state of art 
editing on the web. Panelists will discuss the varying levels of work 
and practices involved in editing texts for publication online, from 
the mechanical and technical aspects (research, fact checking, making 
corrections after publishing) to larger conceptual and ethical matters 
(changing attitudes toward quality). Writers and editors today have 
access to a wide range of resources—from Google searches and Wikipedia 
to JSTOR and Oxford Art Online—that were unavailable (and even 
unimaginable) twenty or thirty years ago. How has the advent of such 
resources affected the editorial process?This session, whose format will be a roundtable conversation, with the 
chair serving as an active interviewer rather than a passive moderator, 
will focus on specific examples and case studies rather than on 
generalizations and abstractions. Speakers, who may include authors, 
critics, editors, or publishers, will address personal and academic 
websites, online versions of printed publications, born-digital 
journals, and blogs; they may also consider the training of younger 
writers, critics, historians, and editors.The chair seeks four participants for the session. Speakers are not 
required to present a paper prepared in advance, although a brief 
presentation of five to ten minutes can be accommodated. Please send a 
letter of interest, a CV, and your area(s) of professional interest and 
expertise to Christopher Howard at chris(a)christopher-howard.net.
