the one about the EU-supported project but accidentally deleted it by 
subject line later--but it would actually be great if someone who didn't 
wipe them would ask the posters to repost on DM or alternatively to give 
their permission for forwarding to DM. I agree that it was a fascinating 
exchange for this list to see.Murray McGillivrayDan O'Donnell wrote:
