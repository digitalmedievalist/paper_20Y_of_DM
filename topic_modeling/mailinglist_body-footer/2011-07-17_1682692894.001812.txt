source for the study of English liturgy created by the late David Chadd.
 Does anyone know what happened to the site (http://www.cursus.uea.ac.uk/)?
 It appears to have disappeared, and the email address provided is also a
dead-end.With many thanksEyal Poleg--===============1925242474884778773==
