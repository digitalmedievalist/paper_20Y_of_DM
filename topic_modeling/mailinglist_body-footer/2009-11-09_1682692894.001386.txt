be considered an adequate substitute for the DM mailing list. IMHO it
could be a parallel channel for announcements and news, I have several
feeds on FB that work exactly as a supplementary information feed to the
main web site/mailing list.Ciao	Roberto--=20Roberto Rosselli Del Turco      roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
