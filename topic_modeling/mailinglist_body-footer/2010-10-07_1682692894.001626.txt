Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Digital Medievalist,This is part of a larger and older problem. For example, my Film Studies coll=
eagues tell me that there is no standard way to point to a particular locatio=
n in a film for reference purposes. Film scholars may use approximate timing =
references, and at some point in the production process film has very fine-gr=
ained timing information attached to it, but there is no standard pointing an=
d reference system in wide use in scholarship, comparable to page references =
with paginated print materials. The reference system for music is better deve=
loped, since we can count measures, although I have no idea how one points to=
 a moment inside an improvisational cadenza.Closer to our electronic home, unless there is internal section numbering in =
the text or internal anchors in the html, there is no standard way to point t=
o a particular location in a static web page comparable to a page in a book (=
even though the web page may be length of many, many book pages). We may be m=
ore aware of these limitations with Kindles and their ilk than we are with ot=
her media because we naturally think of them as a funny kind of book and we s=
ubconsciously expect to find the familiar book-like interface, complete with =
pagination, but fine-grained, reproducible location referencing may be more e=
xceptional in the world of texts than we think.Sincerely,David J. Birnbaum (djbpitt(a)pitt.edu)-----Original Message-----

Locations provide a way for Kindles, but the Locations will vary depending on=
 the font size in use.  So it will provide the individual with a way to refer=
ence something for themselves, but not for anyone else (arbitrary bookmarks t=
hat might come close to canonical).This is one of the largest problems with ebooks and ereaders for scholarly wo=

oss-references.  To date, I have no heard of any such standards in the works.=
 Perhaps others have.Patrick Gardella
