http://mesa-medieval.org). This is an aggregator (directed by me and Tim
Stinson at NCSU) that enables cross-searching of a variety of more-or-less
small to medium sized projects and collections. I know you're looking
specifically for collections, but it's easy to get from MESA to the sites
of the projects and collections aggregated there.Hope this helps,
