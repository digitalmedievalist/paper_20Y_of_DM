experience I'm looking for.At the TEI, we are investigating ways of automating subscriber, member,=20
and conference registration with an eye to accepting credit cards and=20
preparing the ground for some additional members benefits. Currently,=20
the software we are looking at most intensely is Zencart, an open source=20
PHP- and MySQL-based shopping cart system that is well supposed by=20
Credit Card redemption companies. We can get it to do most of what we=20
want, but there are some odd bits: for example it seems to be impossible=20
to get it to stop shouting about the fact that we are offering free=20
shipping on your memberships and conference subscription. And of course=20
there is maintenance overhead associated with any complex software.This makes me wonder if a full shopping cart might be more than we need.=20
Does anybody have experience at any of their various projects and/or=20
societies with setting up membership and conference registration,=20
preferably with the option to accept credit cards?Since this is TAN, please contact me offlist!-dan--=20
