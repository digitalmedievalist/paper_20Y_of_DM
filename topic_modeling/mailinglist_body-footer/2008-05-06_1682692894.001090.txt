 Canadian and international scholars and practitioners working on the
 application of digital technology to the study of material culture up to
 c.1700 (computer science, archaeology, anthropology, geography, history,
 literature, etc.) for a pre-conference seminar on "Digitizing Early Material
 Culture: from Antiquity to Modernity."  Final submissions should aim to be
 2,500-5,000 words in length and may address digital projects, programs of
 research, digital tools and practices, or theory related to the digitization
 of material culture to the end of the seventeenth century.  Complete papers
 will be circulated in advance of the conference and participants (presenters
 and non-presenters) will sign up for and participate in two to three
 sessions on Thursday, 16 October, having read the complete papers (2-3 per
 session) in advance.  Each session will comprise short introductory
 summaries by presenters (5-10 minutes) followed by extensive discussion of
 the circulated texts.  Participants can expect to receive concrete and
 expert advice from other participants as they pool expertise (together with
 our invited speakers) to consider how the project, tool, or theory can be
 further developed toward publication or implementation All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, which
 will be available subsequently through the conference Web-site.  Complete
 papers will be published on the conference Web-site prior to the conference.
  Contributors to the seminar will also be invited to submit papers for a
 collection on "Digitizing Early Material Culture, from Antiquity to 1700,"
 to be edited by Brent Nelson (University of Saskatchewan) and Melissa Terras
 (University College London) for the New Technologies in Medieval and
 Renaissance Studies series at MRTS (series editors Ray Siemens and William
 Bowen). Proposal abstracts should be sent electronically as a MS Word, WordPerfect,
 or pdf file to:

 consideration of our change in speakers, the deadline for proposal
 submissions is now 15 June 2008, and complete papers will be due 15
 September 2008
 CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS FOR "NEW DIRECTIONS IN TEXT ANALYSIS" The organizing committee of CaSTA 2008 also invites proposals from Canadian
 and international scholars and practitioners working in any area of
 technical or textual studies addressing the conference theme, "New
 Directions in Text Analysis."  This will be the sixth annual CaSTA
 conference, held in association with TAPoR (the Text Analysis Portal).  The
 two days of the conference (17-18 October) will feature keynote and plenary
 addresses, papers, panels, and posters on a wide range of topics related to
 the future of digital text analysis.  Presentations might address such
 topics as=E2=80=A2      changing notions of what constitutes a text
 - the relationship of the material text (its physical manifestation) to the
 ideal text (the text as an abstraction of words in a particular combination)
 - editing and publishing digital texts for a changing readership
 - new media and digital textual scholarship
 - new tools and methodologies for text analysis
 - digital texts and analysis in the scholarly mainstream
 - working with graduate students and research teams Abstracts of 500-700 words should propose presentations in one of three form=
s:
 - Single papers (max of 3,000 words)
 - Panels (three to five papers on a common theme)
 - Posters (max of 750 words), either hard copy (approximately two square
 metres of board space) or digital with terminal access provided.  Posters
 will remain on display throughout the conference and there will be a
 designated session time for presenters to discuss their work.
 Abstract proposals should include the following information: title of paper,
 author's name(s); complete mailing address, including e-mail; institutional
 affiliation and rank, if any, of the author; statement of need for
 audio-visual equipment. Abstracts of papers should clearly indicate the
 paper's thesis, methodology and conclusion. CaSTA 2008 especially wants to encourage the participation of graduate
 students, whose work is even now incubating many of the new directions that
 this conference will begin to explore.  Cara Leitch (PhD candidate,
 University of Victoria) will conduct sessions of particular interest to
 graduate students and to projects that involve significant student training
 and participation. Travel grants will be available to students who travel to
 attend the conference. All accepted papers and posters will be published in the conference
 proceedings, which will be available subsequently through the conference
 Web-site.  Abstracts will also be published on the conference Web-site prior
 to the conference.  Selected papers from the conference will be included in
 a special issue of the peer reviewed journal, Text Technology. Proposal abstracts should be sent electronically as a MS Word, WordPerfect,
