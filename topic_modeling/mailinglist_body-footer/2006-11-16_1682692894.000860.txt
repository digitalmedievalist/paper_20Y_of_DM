like Mandala diagrams in mind. I actually remember seeing on some History or
Discovery Channel type show a software package used to track phone numbers,
etc. for linking criminal syndicates together. The phone numbers were listed
around the circumference of a circle and then each number was linked to
every other with a line across the circle, and the color of the line
indicated the strength of the connection (in number of calls placed or
received). It looked like a nifty way to see a variety of relationships
within a coherent body of material. I wonder if anything like that is
available for analyzing language. Does anyone have any experience with the software used in the Canterbury
Tales Project? dkline____________________________________Daniel T.
