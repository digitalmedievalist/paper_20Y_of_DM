Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitCompared to all of the other concordancing tools I think that Watt's is the
simplest to use.  Also, what's great about it is that it can handle
characters such as <thorn> and <eth>.  A nice feature in the program is
that you can save the results as an html document, but the drawback is
that you cannot save it in xml or any other format except as text.  Are
there any concordance programs that allow you to convert to xml?Abdullah AlgerQuoting Godfried Croenen <g.croenen(a)liverpool.ac.uk>:> Hi Laurie,
