chew on. I suppose we will definitely revive a mailing list that is 
still "lying around" and is hosted by our university [1]; and we will 
see what additional steps we are going to take.FWIW, the question in itself was a kind of empirical test - I have 
cross-posted the same question on different (academic and non-academic) 
social networks and fora, but - except for one suggestion on facebook - 
here, i.e. a mailing list, was the only occasion where I did get some 
feedback. If anyone is interested, I can provide more detail and links.Thanks again, and best regardsAndreas
