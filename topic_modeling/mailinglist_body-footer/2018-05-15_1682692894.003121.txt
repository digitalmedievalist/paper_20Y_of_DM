Gottschalk Antiphonal, the manuscript that was the subject of my
dissertation and first book:
http://fragmentarium.ms/view/page/F-75ud/The Gottschalk Antiphonal was written and illustrated in the late
twelfth century by the scribe/artist/monk Gottschalk of Lambach and was
used at the Lambach abbey for several centuries. Along with many other
early manuscripts, It was broken for binding scrap in the late fifteenth
century, and its leaves were used as flyleaves, pastedowns, and spine-
liners for books found at the Abbey bindery. During World War II, many
of the leaves were removed from the bindings and sold as a way to raise
money for a new wood lathe for the abbey. The leaves are now scattered
and have been identified at the Houghton Library at Harvard University,
the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale, the St. Louis
Public Library, a hotel in Badgastein (Austria), the abbey of St. Paul
im Lavanttal, and in Lambach itself (although the leaves that were bound
into incunables there as late as 1998 have now vanished and are
represented in my reconstruction by my old black-and-white photographs).
As recently as 2016, an offset of a leaf of the Antiphonal was found in
an incunable belonging to the Beinecke Library (ironically, it was there
while I was working on  my thesis at Yale, but it was only during a
recent survey of the bindings by Elizabeth Hebbard (Indiana Univ.) that
the offset was photographed and identified). The missing leaf was
consecutive with one of the leaves at Harvard, and I have added a
manipulated image of the offset to my Fragmentarium reconstruction.
For those of you who care about such things, it is worth noting that
images of the two leaves at Harvard have been imported directly into
Fragmentarium using a persistent IIIF url. The other images were
uploaded as individual JPGs.
When I first studied the manuscript in the early 1990s, I did it with
scissors and paste and black-and-white photocopies on the floor of my
living room. It is truly thrilling to see it in glorious IIIF-compliant
interoperable color in Fragmentarium! I hope that it will complement the
liturgical, art historical, and musicological study in my book:
