digital technology related sessions as well that are planned. For example, the Medieval and Renaissance Drama Society is doing a
roundtable/session (depending on number of speakers) on Technology 
and Early Drama.  I'm sure there are others.  What I would suggest is that after the conference programme is 
finalised the DM project attempt to contact the session organiser or 
paper presenter for any session/paper that looks like it is concerned 
with computer technology in one way or another.  Perhaps if we submit 
a list of sessions/papers the conference organisers might be willing 
to give us back a list of email addresses from the database. (Hrmm...
maybe not) Then set up a meeting one suppertime where we can all meet 
and plan what we want to do for the following year.  We can of course 
try to get this meeting in the programme, and if so, now is the 
time to do it.My two pence,
