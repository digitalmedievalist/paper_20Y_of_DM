You may be interested to know that French student are proposed the C2i, 
or "Certificat Informatique et Internet". It's a national certification 
organized in the universities, with the adequate lectures (it follows a 
B2i or "Brevet Informatique et Internet", delivered in high school / 
secondary school).
In my "Alma Mater", I know students can try to pass the C2i level 1 at 
the end of their 1st year, but it's often tough to them and many fail 
(they can try again).
You'll find some more information in English here: 
http://www2.c2i.education.fr/sections/en/presentation/
including a referential of the general and transverse skills mandatory 
for the "basic" C2i
http://www2.c2i.education.fr/sections/en/c2il1/c2i1ref
You'll see that there are several C2i "options", for teachers and 
several fields of studies (sadly, humanities are not one of them).
The C2i is well planned in France now, with many expert trainers, and if 
you want to get in touch with experimented C2i teachers / examinators 
I'd be happy to try and act as a go between and direct you to some 
contacts.Good luck :)
