Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableA couple of months ago, I announced that I'd taken on an intern for the
summer who was going to start adding project descriptions to our wiki.She has just added the first tranche.She will be getting in touch directly with project contact people to let
them know their project is listed now, and to invite them to take a look
to make sure the presentation and information is what they would want to
see--and to invite them to make any improvements they would like to see.In the meantime, though, I thought I'd make a general announcement.You ca go to the project list directly by following this link:
http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Category:ProjectsIf your project is not listed there, let me encourage you to add a page
about it, or let us know (caedmon(a)uleth.ca) so we can start a page for
you. Beginning a new page on the wiki is as simple as signing in, and
then typing the name you'd like for your page in the address line after
index.php/. You then get the edit screen and away you go.E.g. If I wanted to make a page on the Grinch starting at the main page:1) Signup and login
2) change "Main_Page" in the URL in the URL line of my browser with the
page name I want:> http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Main_Page > http://sql.uleth.ca/dmo=
rgwiki/index.php/Digital Grinch Project(spaces and punctuation are allowed in Wiki URLs)3) Start editingThe wiki language is also pretty easy:=3DHeading 1=3D
