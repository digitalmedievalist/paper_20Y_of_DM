d upcoming executive), let me encourage you to circulate this call for nomina=
tions and also to paraphrase it or translate it into other languages if you t=
hink that might encourage participation from underrepresented groups.In the period December 2013-January 2014, proposed bylaws were circulated for=
 comment to the community (the bylaws can be found here:
http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/proposed-bylaws/). These bylaws had been appro=
ved by the ad hoc executive we established a year ago to oversee the first ye=
ar of the organisation.The bylaws establish the procedure by which GO::DH shall be governed in the f=
uture. They call for the election of an 8 member executive, from which a chai=
r shall be chosen. The executive will also be responsible for appointing all =
officers. Normally, the executive will be elected to staggered two year terms=
, with half the executive up for election each year. For the first year, all =
positions on the executive are open: half the vacancies will be for a one yea=
r (renewable) term, the other half for a two year (renewable) term. Normally,=
 the nominations and elections will occur in January. For a variety of reason=
s, not least of which was the need to circulate the bylaws for comment, we ar=
e one month late this year.I have recently been given funding to hire an administrative assistant, Mia A=
ngelica Alcantara-Santiago, who has agreed to serve as returning officer and =
chair of the nominations committee for this first election (in future years, =
these positions will be held by a member of the executive who is not up for r=
eelection). We would like, therefore, to open nominations for candidates for =
the executive of GO::DH.Any member of our mailing list may stand for election and self-nominations ar=
e very welcome. If you would like to nominate somebody for election (includin=
g yourself), please email Mia Angelica at caedmon(a)uleth.ca<mailto:caedmon(a=
)uleth.ca>. She will need the name and email address of the nominee. Please e=
nsure that your nominee is willing to stand for election. Please also ask the=
 nominee if they would prefer to stand for a one or a two year term (both ter=
ms are renewable; in the future, all terms will be two years). In keeping wit=
h the goals and mandate of GO::DH, we strongly encourage diversity in our nom=
inees: there are no linguistic, geographic, or other requirements for office =
and we encourage nominees from all countries and speakers of all languages to=
 apply.Nominations will close February 15. A ballot will then be prepared with the c=
andidates names and members of the mailing list will be asked to select up to=
 eight names for election. The ballot will close, one week after it opens and=
 the first elected GO::DH executive will be announced.Dan--
