at medievalists, per se, but is powerful and outputs in a variety of formats.=
 "Cite-as-you-write" is still a bit weak (though it works well in XML). Becau=
se the outputs are XSL determined, problems like you discuss with eds. and co=
mmas are easily fixable.It is a server based program.

Ever tried zotero? Available at http://www.zotero.org/ it lives as a =20
Firefox extension. It's note as versatile as a dedicated =20
bibliographical software but can do more then that and can prove =20
valuable as an overall research tool.I am also using jabref (http://jabref.sourceforge.net/), written in =20
Java, open source and BibTex based. It's not exactly user friendly but =20
quite powerful.Best,
