Research Assistant in the use of ICT in ArchaeologyJISC-funded Research Project, VERA: Virtual Environments for Research
in ArchaeologyApplications are invited for the part-time post of Research Assistant

work on VERA: Virtual Environments for Research in Archaeology. This

Project at the University of Reading (our research collaborators).The post will involve: conducting qualitative studies and recording,
analysing and writing up the results as part of a research team at
UCL, collaborating with the team at Reading University, collaborating
with archaeologists at Silchester, and collaborating with the wider
archaeological community utilising the data being produced from the
Silchester dig. We aim to discover how archaeologists are using
advanced technology, and how new systems can be better designed to
help them in their research. For further details on the project please
see: http://www.vera.rdg.ac.uk .The post is available to start on 17 September 2007, with funding for
17 months (to 28 February 2009) on a part-time (50%) basis.
