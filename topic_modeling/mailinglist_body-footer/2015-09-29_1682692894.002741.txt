seven Middle English manuscripts, they are all described but perhaps one of
them is unedited? Here's a list; click on any title, then click the "View
Provenance and Subject" tab at the top of the image viewing window and
scroll down to Indexed / Referenced in for details:http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/search.html?fq=3Dlanguage_facet%3A%22=
English%2C%20Middle%20%281100-1500%29%22All seven mss have been digitized.Let me know if any of these are unedited - I'm curious!DotOn Mon, Sep 21, 2015 at 6:40 AM, Johanna Feenstra <
