Back in late 2009, I tried to obtain permission from the BAV to use one image=
 of a folio from a Virgil manuscript as a cover or at least as a frontispiece=
 for my forthcoming monograph, "The Methods of Medieval Translators (2011).
      Permission denied.

Hi,regarding Vatican's copyright statement, I think that there are some
things that can be built, or prototyped -- e. g. a text linking to a page
of a MS like they did in <monumenta.ch> -- that do not infringe Vatican
Library's copyright.  Such projects, surely, risk that the link will
vanish overnight -- but the site does offer us (in German, I guess)
"Persistente URL" for its images.And I guess that it would depend what we ask the authorisation for. A
scholarly undertaking, such as publishing an on-line edition which uses
BAV's images, should be acceptable, and they should actually be glad that
somebody wants to do this. Otherwise, why spend so much money for
digitisation?Best,Neven Jovanovic
