I realize that I have a pleasure to address the experts, but sometimes 
even experts may enjoy a small /repetitio/: in a couple of days we start 
an online course "Meet the Queen. Introduction to Medieval Theology" at 
Collegium Volatile. After all, when did you last write a /questio/? Or 
discussed the existence of God? We will read source texts and talk. Join 
us.
With very best regards,
Emilia Zochowska
  Details:
  Meet the Queen. Introduction to Medieval TheologyWhich is the queen of sciences? Mathematics? Logic? Philosophy? In the 
Middle Ages there was no doubt: it´s Theology. In this period 
Christianity shaped the framework for culture: literature, philosophical 
enquiry and even architecture were revolving round the central notion of 
God – and God could have been accessed through intellectual enquiry.The unique structure of this course takes us to the three places where 
theology was practiced: *university* (scholastic theology), *cloister* 
(monastic theology) and *parish church* (sermons and preaching). We will 
also give a voice to women and other laymen – people who contributed to 
the theological milieu of the period even though they were not 
professional theologians. This course is a must for those interested in 
any aspect of the Middle Ages.The course is an introduction: it will lead you inside the huge building 
of Medieval Theology, but it will not make you an expert. You will meet 
many significant authors, hear some more names and book titles and get a 
general idea about the intellectual milieu of the period. Still, many 
other great names and books will be absent. You will also get an 
opportunity to present and explore your own favorite Medieval authors. 
On the reading list you will find, among others: *Augustine, Thomas 
Aquinas, Bernard de Clairvaux, Birgitta of Sweden, Anthony of Padua, 
Francesco Savonarola*.This course is quite time consuming (ca. 5 h/week, most of that is 
individual reading): in relatively short time you will be immersed into 
a world of Medieval literature (*many* *source texts to read*!). All 
texts will be available in English translation.*The course is designed and taught by Emilia Żochowska 
<http://collegiumvolatile.com/?page_id=24>*. The teacher will provide 
reading material, stimulate and moderate discussions on the course 
internal forum. Every week a new unit begins with Emilia´s short video 
talk and completes with a live online chat session – a meeting in our 
virtual classroom.*The students are expected* to read the provided materials, take active 
part in discussions and in the live chat session once a week. We try to 
make this course a social experience, so be prepared to meet other 
students and share your reading .It takes *6 weeks* to complete the course.*Workload:* ca. 5 hours a week.*We start* on 3 March.*To enroll* visit the course´s homepage: 
https://www.coursesites.com/s/_IntroMedievalTheo. We use CourseSites as 
our virtual classroom.*The Course fee:* *700 DKK / 90 EUR / 110 USD *payable via PayPal or 
credit card. If you would like to enroll but are unable to afford the 
fee, please contact Collegium <mailto:office(a)collegiumvolatile.com>
