 the forefront of providing accessible alternative formats for visual content=
? Or of any literature on this?  I have a student with partial sight who is t=
rying to get our library to digitise and provide alternative text for 19thc c=
artoon images, but the archive is concerned about conveying the image as text=
 / raising concerns about the subjectivity of catalogue descriptions. I know =
that we medievists are often great at this kind of thing so thought I'd ask t=
he community.All best wishes,RebeccaRebecca Pope
