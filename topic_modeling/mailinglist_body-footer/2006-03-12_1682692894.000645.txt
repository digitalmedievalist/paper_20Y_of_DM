I thought I'd ask here first in case somebody has some code, or so that
I can get the low down right away.Is there a good way of building links in an xml document so that a
browser pointed at the file can change XSL on the same file. I.e. If I
have file.xsl and I have three different views of that data
(default.xsl, view2.xsl, and view3.xsl) is there a good way of setting
up file.xsl so that a browser pointed at it will be able to change among
views?I want to do this with a TEI-encoded runic file that has filesheets for
editorial or diplomatic presentation, and each of these in runic or
roman letters.-d--===============4910766019787884520==--
