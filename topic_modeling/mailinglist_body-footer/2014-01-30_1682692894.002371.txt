*Exploring very large collections of texts by creating structured=20
unbiased samples*
Pieter Francois (Oxford)Abstract: This presentation introduces the 'Sample Generator', a digital=20
tool which allows users to generate structured unbiased samples of=20
(digital) texts from the nineteenth century British Library holdings.=20
Using the Sample Generator allows researchers to explore quickly a very=20
large dataset (the British Library has approximately 1.8 million=20
nineteenth century holdings) in a methodologically robust way.=20
Furthermore the generated samples are easily citable and shareable. The=20
overall intellectual background of the Sample Generator is that of the=20
'generative humanities' in which a creative process of going back and=20
forth between data and the conceptual drawing board takes centre stage.=20
In addition to saving valuable research time, the main contribution of=20
the Sample Generator is that it is a hypothesis generating and testing=20
tool. This presentation will address the ideas behind the Sample=20
Generator, offer a hands on showcasing of its main functionalities and=20
will finally demonstrate the value and potential of the Sample Generator=20
by zooming in briefly on one case study, i.e. an analysis of the changes=20
in nineteenth century travel routes in Europe.More details at=20
