basic information studies literacy we should be teaching across 
programmes at the university (i.e. not just humanities computing, but 
more broadly what should university graduates know as basic information 
literacy).We're looking into establishing a campus wide certification in 
informatics here which we have the luxury of building more or less ex 
nihilo--i.e. lots of willing people and departments, very few existing 
institutional silos and/or jealousies that need to be worked in or 
around. The goal is to build this as a companion programme--something 
like a big minor, a certification, or an emphasis--that would in theory 
be open to combination any domain baccalaureate. In the end you could 
graduate with "English and informatics", or "Biology and informatics," 
etc. The informatics certification would not be intended to cover all 
possible informatics angles (so somebody doing bio-informatics or 
advanced humanities computing would have to do additional work). But the 
goal would be to produce students with domain competency and a core set 
of informatics skills and knowledge.I am looking at some existing programmes--e.g. Melbourne, Syracuse, 
etc.  But I'm also asking people helping put the programme together to 
think on the basis of a blank page: what skills, knowledge, experience 
should an undergraduate have when they finish such a programme. Here are 
some of mine. What do others think?* Knowledge of basic internet infrastructure and protocols: what a 
server is, how pages are served out, what packets are, how domain-names 
are registered and looked up, all the various transfer protocols
* Knowledge of basic languages and standards like xml, html, unicode
* Experience in setting up a multipage interactive website at an 
arbitrary domain name (i.e. buy a domain name, point it at an IP 
address, set up the server, write the pages
* Knowledge of the major genres and applications and an ability to 
analyse existing sites in terms of their use of these (e.g. know what a 
wiki is, newserver, version control, other things)
* Have some sense of constraints that affect the use of cyberspace: 
gender, economic, legal issues, etc.
* Have a knowledge of various social organisations and processes on the 
web: communities of practice, crowd sourcing
* Be able to analyse information flows and other aspects of a problem 
and design technological solutions to it
* some experience with data design, analysis, and retrievalThese seem to me to be too much of a mishmash of different types of 
scope, categories, and the like. And also too much focussed on the type 
of thing I do. Any suggestions for the skills, knowledge, and experience 
a typical undergraduate ought to have if they were to be certified as 
being basically competent in contemporary web technologies alongside 
their core domain?-dan
