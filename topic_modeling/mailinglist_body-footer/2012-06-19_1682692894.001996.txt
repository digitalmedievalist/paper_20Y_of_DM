Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableI am excited to see discussion on this topic.  We host an online=20
repository of images, transcriptions, and collation tools for scholars=20
doing text criticism on the New Testament.  Often, holding institutions=20
of the ~5600 manuscript copies will not give us permission to house=20
digital images on our own site, but insist on us feeding the images to=20
our users from their website.  This makes providing a seamless=20
experience for our users a challenging task.Our system is composed of a suite of OpenSocial gadgets and one of those=20
gadgets is an image viewer which provides drag to pan, wheel (or 2=20
fingers up/down on a mac) to zoom, brightness/contrast adjust, box=20
annotations, and persistent URLs back to an adjusted view.  It's all=20
javascript and requires no server side or extra client side components=20
beyond the web browser and can view remote URLs for pretty much any=20
image with a link on the internet.  It's all freely available for your=20
use-- easy dropin if you're working inside an opensocial container, or=20
we have a standalone version too which is a simple popup webpage.You can try the gadget out here:http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/manuscript-workspace?docid=3D10001
(click on a thumbnail and it will load the full image)and the standalone version can be seen by clicking the permalink icon=20
("Embeddable External Viewer Link To This Image") to generate a return=20
link to your view of the image.
(The "Discuss" button doesn't really do anything if you're not logged=20
in, so avoid that one unless you create an account)We also have a firefox plugin which will construct the appropriate link=20
for viewing an image in the image viewer.  You simply install the=20
plugin, browse to any internet page with an image in which you are=20
interested in, and then on the plugin, press "Annotate".  It's crude and=20
assumes the largest image on the page is the one you'd are interested=20
in, but mostly does what our users expect.  It can read images from some=20
sites which use custom viewers by piecing tiles together, but mostly the=20
images must be simple jpg, png, gif images.Hope this is helpful.  Please feel free to contact me if you have questions,TroyVirtual Manuscript Room

> Moving to your question, I think the important thing to understand is that =
screen resolutions are still extremely low when compared with (say) printer r=
esolutions. For example a typical laptop screen at 1024x768 is between 75dpi =
and 100dpi depending on the physical screen size. Many modern mobile phone/sm=
art phone dpi tends to be around 150dpi. Of course these are all generalisati=
ons and there are many web based calculators such as http://tiporama.com/tool=
s/pixels_inches.html which can give you a better idea of resolution capabilit=
y on a device by device basis. Compare that with an EPSON printer at 1440dpi =
horizontal resolution and you will understand and appreciate the comparison. =
So it is important to understand that the image you display at any one time o=
n the screen can be relatively low (for performance reasons), but the underly=
ing source image (the original scan) needs to be high and lossless to allow t=
he best level of zoom as you move closer and closer into the page. As a palaeographer, I want to be able to see 'the big picture' (i.e. the whole=20
page) at any one time but then I also want to be able to zoom into=20
sections of the manuscript and then down to the individual characters=20
(without pixellation)  to determine if that character really is an "S"=20
or an "A" (palaeographers will get the joke here). The problem with most=20
lossy compressions is that the 'big picture' is great but, as you zoom=20
in, you start to see significant degradation of the image (a by-product=20
of the way the compression is done) which gets in the way of scholarly=20
interpretation. For example take a high resolution TIFF image, compress=20
it at various JPG levels and then print it full page on a high=20
resolution printer. You will find that all the samples are virtually=20
indistinguishable from each other until you bring out a magnifying glass=20
and then all will become depressingly clear in terms of the drop in=20
image quality/fidelity at the lowest file sizes.

p://djvu.org/resources/whatisdjvu.php and Virtual Vellum) which can also help=

ion that has longevity and is not going to disappear or change once your rese=
arch project is completed. There are a number of Flash based viewers around b=
ut (as James also implies), Adobe's track record at maintaining backward comp=

pt project at least, is that the underlying image is at the highest resolutio=
n possible (lossless) and the capabilities to zoom into 'snapshots' of that i=

napshot' that gets displayed at any one time on the screen can be relatively =
low for optimal performance but it still needs to be an accurate subset of th=
e original image and as a result downscaling resolution from a lossy compress=

 from the original tiffs, but I don't know whether there is any sense of best=
 practice concerning what that size should be. If I go the lossy route, what'=
s a reasonable value?

nset view? Currently the magnifying glass inset always shows the image at 200=
% of the actual file size (not the size of the page as displayed without magn=
ification in the browser window!). You can see the difference by comparing, s=
ay, folio 30v (about 2MB) to 284r (about 270k), where the magnification is mu=
ch greater in the former than the latter. I can set the level of magnificatio=
n anywhere I'd like, but is there any agreement about best practice here?

allow the user to see the image conveniently alongside the transcription, ver=
ifying any moments where our editorial judgment might appear surprising or qu=
estionable. The point of the magnified inset is to let the user examine detai=
ls that may not be visible at lesser magnification, such as erasures, correct=
ions, etc. My casual impression is that 30v looks pretty good and loads reaso=
nably quickly (although quicker would be better), but I don't place great con=
fidence in my own casual impressions.
