legal culture in the early middle ages.  We construe the subject of
this issue broadly, and we are eager to receive submissions
representing a variety of perspectives, methodologies, national or
ethnic cultures, and disciplines.  Possible topics include (but are
not limited to): royal legislation, legal manuscripts, law in/and
literature, legal procedure, charters and diplomatics, writs and
wills, dispute resolution, theories of law and justice, canon law,
editing medieval law, law and philosophy, perceptions of medieval law
in later periods, law in/and art, international law, and intersections
between medieval Asian and European legal traditions.  We welcome
traditional philological and historicist approaches, as well as those
informed by modern critical theory.Prospective contributors should feel free to contact Andrew Rabin
(andrew.rabin(a)louisville.edu) if they have any questions.Articles should be 7000 words including bibliography and endnotes, and
conform to The Heroic Age's in-house style.  Instructions may be found
at http://www.heroicage.org/authors.html. All submissions will be
reviewed by two readers according to a double-blind policy.  All
submissions should be sent to haediting(a)yahoo.com.  The deadline for
submission is July 1st, 2008.The Heroic Age is an on-line, peer-reviewed academic journal hosted by
the Memorial University of Newfoundland.  It focuses on Northwestern
Europe during the early medieval period (from the late 4th through
11th centuries).  We seek to foster dialogue between all scholars of
this period across ethnic and disciplinary boundaries, including-but
not limited to-history, archaeology, and literature pertaining to the
period.--
