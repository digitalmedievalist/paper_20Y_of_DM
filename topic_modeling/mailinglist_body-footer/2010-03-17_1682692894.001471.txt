Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitThanks, Grant! This is just the sort of thing I want. I'll test it  
too. An additional requirement I've got is that I want it to work in e- 
book readers (specifically epub) as well as browsers. So Stanza, Adobe  
Digital Editions, the Firefox EpubReader add-on. This may let out  
counters for the time being, since these apps seem to run behind the  
others in implementing CSS goodies.  I'm not trying to be difficult: these are the constraints I'm  
actually working with. I'm testing in a pretty long list of apps. (But  
I don't care about IE7.)PeterSent from my iPodOn Mar 17, 2010, at 8:56 PM, "Simpson, Grant Leyton" <glsimpso(a)indiana.edu
