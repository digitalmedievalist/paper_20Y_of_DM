precisely is meant by "is considered"? The publishers consider it so? 
Common perception? It is explicitly enshrined in copyright law to be 
so? It has been tested in court and held up?(This is a genuine question: so much of even expert legal opinion on 
these matters can be in doubt unless the claim has been tested. On the 
other hand, if you work for a college or similar institution, you will 
no doubt be under strict instructions to cover your back, so the 
unsatisfactory answer is that you should consider something under 
copyright and requiring permission unless it is absolutely unmistakably 
the case that it is not...)Yours continuing to seek disambiguity where there probably is none,G--
