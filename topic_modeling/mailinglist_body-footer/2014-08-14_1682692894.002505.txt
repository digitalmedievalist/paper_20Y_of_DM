Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear all,I'd like to take this opportunity to officially welcome Alberto, Fran=
z and Georg to the DM Board, and to welcome back Alexei for a second term. I=
'd also like to thank our outgoing members, Orietta da Rold, Takako K=
ato and Timoty Leonardi, for all their many contributions to DM over the last=
 two or four years. Thanks also to Dominique and Ben for running the election=
s this year.Regarding restructuring, things have been on hold a bit due to the elections =
and to being =E2=80=98conference season' and summer vacation, but wor=
k on this will resume again shortly, with more news to follow.Please also keep in mind that there are many ways that you can all contribute=
 to DM, even if not through formal Board membership. There are a lot of small=
 but essential roles that need to be covered, such as the journal, Facebook a=
dmin, mailing-list admin, Twitter feed, website management (admin and content=
), wiki/blog management, organising and running conference sessions, and more=
. These roles are typically handled by Board members, but if anyone else want=
s to be involved then please do get in touch. Suggestions are also very welco=
me of new things you would like us to do are very welcome as well.All the best,Peter
