Subject: scriptorium: medieval and early modern manuscripts online
Date: Mon, 7 Apr 2008 08:09:51 +0100
From: Christopher Burlinson <cmb29(a)CAM.AC.UK>
Reply-To: Online Manuscript Research <MANUSCRIPTS-ONLINE(a)JISCMAIL.AC.UK>
To: MANUSCRIPTS-ONLINE(a)JISCMAIL.AC.UKWith apologies for self-promotion, and for any cross-posting.I would like to announce the Phase 1 launch of Scriptorium: Medieval and
Early Modern Manuscripts Online, an AHRC-funded project based at the
Faculty of English, Cambridge University.http://scriptorium.english.cam.ac.ukScriptorium will comprise full digital facsimiles of at least twenty late
medieval and early modern manuscript miscellanies and commonplace books,
along with descriptions, transcriptions and bibliographical information; a
set of research and teaching resources for students and scholars working on
manuscript studies; and an enhanced version of English Handwriting: An
Online Course, our interactive palaeography tool:http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/ceres/ehoc/All parts of the site will remain freely and publicly available.Currently, the resource includes images of St Johns College, Cambridge, MS
S.23, an early seventeenth-century poetic miscellany. More images and
information will be added progressively in the coming weeks and months, as
the site is enhanced, expanded and developed.We hope that the resource will be useful to the wide scholarly community.
