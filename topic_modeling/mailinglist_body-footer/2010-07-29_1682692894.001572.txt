le format and medium, of the preservation of user experience (UX) and user in=
terface (UI), specifically when materials are specifically presented as editi=
ons and archives. While care must be taken to choose formats that will withst=
and the test of time, such as TEI, I would argue that we, as a community, nee=
d to address the issue of UX and UI preservation (which to my mind can only b=
e approached through emulation). Upfront decisions, though, about file format=
s can greatly influence this, though. Take for example, Dan O'Donnell's editi=
on of Caedmon's Hymn. Since nothing in it can't be rendered by a standard web=
 browser, it is cross platform and should be compatible with browsers for som=
e time to come. This is not so with platform-specific editions, such as those=
 done on CD-ROM that only work, for example, on Mac OS 9. (I recently had to =
acquire a computer running OS 9 so I could take a look at some of these.)=E2=9C=8D

Dear Digital Medievalists and TEI members,I have a question about preservation of digital content especially medieval m=
anuscripts. I am writing a small article on the topic and I have consulted a =
lot sources (papers, handbooks) but most of them do not say anything about th=
e =E2=80=9Clife span=E2=80=9D of the data in specific formats. To clarify thi=
s =E2=80=93 a .doc file crated in 1995. Will be most likely unreadable  in 20=
10.  What about other formats? Has anyone done some research on =E2=80=9Clife=
 span=E2=80=9D of a specific version of digital formats and when it becomes c=
lear that the new version and the old one are not compatible anymore? And her=
e I am talking about pdf, rtf, doc (and all office files), djvu, tiff, jpg , =
mpg etc. (texts and images especially)
In my work I am also making a small remark on XML as a data container since i=
t is, in my opinion, the best way to go and the standard will surely be aroun=
d for years. But what kind of steps do you make to ensure the preservation of=
 documents that have been encoded in xml
I would also like to hear if there are opposing views on xml.
I also have the same question about the media. I found some research about th=
e longevity of CDs and DVDs but I am also interested in other media like olde=
r hard disks, zip drives and magnetic media.
I am sorry to bother you with this, but I can use any help I can get
Thank you in advance
