very good. But I'd question whether Brill has "opened access." It's=20
offered for private use only: the website doesn't say, but I suspect=20
that if you want to use it in a publication you'll have to pay. There=20
are several very good fonts for medievalists (besides Junicode, which I=20
keep going on about); you can find them listed at the Medieval Unicode=20
Font Initiative website (http://mufi.info). I'll also mention, for=20
people who have a budget to spend on a font, Andron Mega=20
(http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=3D145). The design=20
is brilliant, and it covers everything medievalists want.Peter BakerOn 2/3/12 3:30 PM, Daniel O'Donnell wrote:
