                            ProDoc(a)DocEng
   Doctoral Consortium at the ACM Symposium on Document Engineering
            http://www.doceng2013.org/doctoral-consortium/Call for Submissions* Submission Deadline: June 5, 2013 (24:00 CEST)* Notification of Acceptance: June 20, 2013--------------------------------------------------------------------For the first time, the ACM Symposium on Document Engineering will
feature a doctoral consortium, called ProDoc(a)DocEng.PhD students present their dissertation project and will get
feedback from a panel of senior researchers as well as from the
general audience.ProDoc(a)DocEng is intended to provide constructive criticism and help
PhD students in formulating their research question, deciding about
methods and approaches to use, and creating further ideas.  It is a
good place to learn about how to conduct a dissertation project and to
learn about leading edge research, the results of which might be
presented at one of the next Symposia.  Participants of ProDoc(a)DocEng
register for DocEng 2013 and will thus be able to attend all sessions
of the Symposium.ProDoc(a)DocEng will take place during the Symposium.  Each participant
will be allocated 10 minutes for presentation, followed feedback and
questions.  There will be no publication for ProDoc(a)DocEng.You are not required to have an accepted paper/poster/demo for DocEng
2013 to be eligible for ProDoc(a)DocEng.  However, if you are author or
co-author of an accepted submission, we encourage you to present your
dissertation project at ProDoc(a)DocEng.For participation, please provide a proposal, briefly outlining your
dissertation topic.  Please also state your affiliation or/and
employer, your main supervisor and your academic background.  See
below for details.PhD students accepted for ProDoc(a)DocEng are eligible to apply for
Student Travel Awards, for details see:<http://www.doceng2013.org/support-for-students>

   respect to the duration of PhD studies or internal and external
   readers, please add this information.  Please also note if you are
   looking for a second supervisor.- Then, describe your dissertation project including your research
   question, related work, and the current status of your work (i.e.,
