Subject: [dm-l] After... Mailing List, Wiki, Blog or what?Dear Colleagues,I'd like to add a follow up question to this very informative discussion.I am also in the process of building a DH sub-community for a specific discip=
linary niche.I would like to ask your advice on governance and standards.I am looking for models and best practices to ensure long term sustainability=
 of my collaborative DH project once it hopefully outgrows its incubation sta=
ge.Could you please point me to long running DH projects whose protocols for gov=
ernance, editorial oversight, institutional ownership/hosting I might emulate=
? I am thinking of medium sized DH projects as models, so bigger than one sch=
olar publishing a digital project, but much smaller than the TEI consortium o=
r Digital Medievalist.Given the concerns over sustainability inherent in DH, I am also interested i=
n advice on how to transition a project from the stage where a grant-funded P=
I is the leader in getting content online to where a volunteer editorial boar=
d (and institutional hosts) maintain a project longer term. Also, how do DH p=
rojects handle the preservation of content for such a project? The data will =
be licensed open source, but who should hold the copyright and renew the doma=
in name after the project is launched? A university library? An s-corporation=
 independent of any institution (like some non-profit scholarly journals or p=
rofessional societies)? the public domain, the original scholarly contributor=
s?Please suggest links to examples to follow from existing projects if you are =
aware of them.Thank you!DaveDavid A. MichelsonAssistant Professor
