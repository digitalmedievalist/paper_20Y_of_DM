I would like to share with you this message I just sent to the TEI list.
This projects needs collaboration from a wide range of scholars, even those
who are not familiar with the TEI but would like to help listing the
various individual tasks and phenomena involved in scholarly works like
critical editions.
Best regards,
Marjorie---------- Forwarded message ----------

Subject: Collaboration needed: Creating "cheatsheets" to define best
practice for frequent tasks
To: TEI-L(a)listserv.brown.edu
Dear TEI users,
I would like to invite you to participate in a project that is very dear to
my heart.Two years ago, I created a Critical Apparatus
Cheatsheet<http://marjorie.burghart.online.fr/?q=3Den/content/tei-critical-ap=
paratus-cheatsheet>
giving
in a nutshell the "translation" (if I may say so) in TEI of phenomena
familiar to scholars making critical editions.
Today, I would like to develop the "cheatsheets" as an alternative way of
learning TEI, specially targetting people who are familiar with the
Humanities concepts behind the encoding, but not the encoding itself.
I believe that the advantages of such best practice guides would be
twofold:
- provide a low-threshold way of learning to encode in TEI for some
categories of people at least
- provide tool developpers with a clear list of tasks for several
operations (i.e. encoding a critical edition, for instance) and the
recommended way(s) to encode them, which would greatly facilitate interface
building.I have summarized my thought on this TEI Wiki page:
http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/TEI_Cheatsheets
and suggested some Cheatsheets we could start creating collaboratively on
the Wiki.Please give it some thought, and suggest some tasks, phenomena, and their
best encoding(s) in TEI!Best regards,--===============3630216501350147984==
