ighted to announce our first virtual symposium:The Past, Present, and Future of Digital Medieval Studies: A Global Digital M=
edievalist Symposium
To be held 24 May, 11 June, and 21 June, 2021,
The era of COVID-19 has been transformational for medieval digital humanities=
. Medievalists have come to learn the limits and possibilities of online scho=
larship, whether in the virtual classroom or in the transfer of knowledge amo=
ng specialists. Although direct access to material sources and the easy face-=
to-face exchanges with colleagues are deeply missed, we have come to understa=
nd that digitally-inflected scholarship can be more economical, more global, =
and -in limited ways- more equitable for many medievalists. And because we ha=
ve come to this inflection point, members of the Digital Medievalist Board ar=
e launching a conference series that marks this turn and aims to build upon w=
hat we have learned. Our theme, The Past, Present and Future of Medieval Digi=
tal Humanities is both retrospective and prospective in scope, bringing digit=
al medievalist practitioners into conversation with each other as we step int=
o a new scholarly environment where digital methods take on a new importance.Our new global awareness has inspired us to plan three conference dates, each=
 of which is aligned with a geographic space and accommodates scholars from t=
hree time zones grouped as The Americas, Asia & Oceania, and Europe & Africa.=
  The Americas conversation will take place on Monday, 24 May 2021, Asia & Oc=
eania on Friday, 11 June, and Africa & Europe on Monday, 21 June.
