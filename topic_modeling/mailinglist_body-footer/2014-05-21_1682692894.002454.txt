Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear all,Many thanks for the thoughts so far, which I appreciate a lot. A few quick re=
sponses for now:- Yes, certainly the blog would be open to anyone as the wiki is now. This is=
 encoded in the Byelaws now and will not be changed. Whether it will lead to =
more input from the Community remains to be seen.- Yes, certainly we would have to preserve the existing URLs, especially for =
the Journal but ideally also for the static content. The Journal is a particu=
lar concern here, of course, and some hosting systems require that they are t=
he only point where the articles are available, meaning that we would have to=
 remove the current copies. I expect that this could be managed with redirect=
s, but it's something we need to check very carefully before committing.- One person (off list) suggested simply adding a recaptcha to the wiki. In p=
rinciple this makes sense, but there is the secondary problem that the sys. a=
dmin. load is such that this proved much more difficult than expected. It req=
uired several upgrades of the wiki, combined with issues of getting root acce=
ss, and our own time pressures. Ultimately the spam is a relatively small asp=
ect: if we decide that a wiki is worth retaining then yes, there are easy eno=
ugh ways of doing that. But it will require an investment of time and effort,=
 and so we thought now is the time to review if it's what we really want.Larry is exactly right in that this is a human problem not a technology probl=
em. The fundamental difficulty that the Board keeps coming up against, as Lar=
ry points out, is that we are all contributing our time and effort without an=
y financial contribution, and the reality is that we are all very busy and st=
ruggling to find the time to maintain what we have. It's easy enough in short=
 bursts: the problem is a framework that's sustainable over years. The change=
 of infrastructure is intended to reduce the load so that we can focus on wha=
t we are good at and what we can really do that has value to the community: i=
n short, sys. admin. and XSLT doesn't seem to be the best use of our energies=
, particularly these days when so many online frameworks are available. A ver=
y modest amount of money would solve a lot of the problems, but introducing m=
embership fees would introduce a whole new set of difficulties, and any one-o=
ff grants or donations are not sustainable in the long term, so I don't think=
 either of these is feasible.Again, though, I hope I'm not suggesting that any of this is a final decision=
. We very much do want to hear your thoughts and suggestions.All the best,Peter
