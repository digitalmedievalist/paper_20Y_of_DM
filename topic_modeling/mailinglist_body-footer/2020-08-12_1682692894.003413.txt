sance records yet included in REED Online, spanning from the late 10th centur=
y to the start of the Civil War in 1642. Records range from a kingale mention=
ed in a 1381 coroner's report to a previously unpublished play based on Sopho=
cles and Seneca performed at Winchester College. Hampshire's record of season=
al festivities =E2=80=93 especially that known regionally as a 'king ale' =E2=
=80=93 complements and extends the Berkshire data across the common county bo=
undary. Winchester, Winchester College, and Southampton are major stops in a =
lively performance circuit including other towns, monasteries, and aristocrat=
ic households which provide abundant evidence of itinerant minstrels, players=
, and other performers.Collection highlights include records of the Quem Quaeritis at Winchester, th=
e boy bishop tradition at St Swithin's Priory, a 1409 legal dispute over a St=
 Agnes play, expenses for constructing stages and sets in the Winchester Coll=
ege hall, licenses to acting troupes from the Master of the Revels that name =
star actors like Edward Alleyn and Will Kemp, and the elaborate entertainment=
 for Queen Elizabeth provided by the earl of Hertford at Elvetham in 1591, wh=
ich appears here in its Hampshire context. Also included are Isle of Wight re=
cords of both folk customs and aristocratic entertainments. All locations are=
 linked to the GIS provincial map of England, which now defines, for the firs=
t time, pre- and post-Reformation diocesan boundaries.Now available on REED Online at https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/  and https=
