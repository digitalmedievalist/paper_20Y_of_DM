journals out of the Lethbridge Journal Incubator (you can learn more 
about the model here: http://journalincubator.org/). Until now, we've 
used Subversion as our central cloud storage. This year, however, I had 
a complete turnover in the graduate assistants, most of whom were not 
very technically inclined and I'm finding Subversion is more hassle than 
it is worth (it mostly works well, but if something goes wrong, the 
students can't fix it).What we need is a cloud based repository system, preferably one that 
allows us access to arbitrary revisions (students find it comforting to 
know they can always correct mistaken overwrites), and preferably does 
version control of some kind--either locking or svn-type comparison. 
Best, however, would be something very low maintenance, drag and drop, 
and preferably doesn't require the use of a special client for file 
manipulation (that's where our subversion issues come).I'm thinking Dropbox or Drive, though I don't know anything about 
setting those up for an organisation. Does anybody have any other tips?-dan--
