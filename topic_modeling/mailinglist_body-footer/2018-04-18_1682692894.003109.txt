Job ad: https://tinyurl.com/ds-UniVieData Science @ Uni Wien is a new research platform at the University of Vienn=
a that presents a hub on all activities in data science at the University of =
Vienna. We have openings for five enthusiastic PhD students to establish an i=
nterdisciplinary research environment. The PhD students will be hosted in one=
 of the faculties of Computer Science, Mathematics, or Business, Economics an=
d Statistics. Each of the PhD students will be co-supervised by members of at=
 least two different faculties and work on research problems in one of five d=
omains, Astronomy, Digital Humanities, Finance, Industry 4.0, Medical Science=
s. The focus in these areas is described as follows:Astronomy is currently undergoing a data deluge with multiwavelength missions=
 on earth and space. The focus of the PhD project in this area is the develop=
ment of algorithmic and visual analysis techniques for the Gaia mission data,=
 an ambitious ESA satellite currently charting a three-dimensional map of our=
 Galaxy with accurate positions and velocities of about 2 billion stars. The =
student will focus on large data exploration and data analysis to tackle astr=
ophysical questions, making use of Data Science tools.The Digital Humanities area will have a particular focus on digital historica=
l studies. The student will focus on the development of suitable data models =
for information about historical people and cultures that is harvested from t=
he digitisation of texts and artifacts. Another goal will be to look at how t=
hese models, and machine learning techniques that make use of them, will coex=
ist with the interpretative critical frameworks through which historical anal=
ysis is usually done.Potential topics in the area of Finance are visual analysis tools for the ana=
lysis of volatility, liquidity and market microstructure relations based on l=
arge cross-sections of limit order book data. A second area will focus on the=
 development and application of dimension reduction techniques for high-dimen=
sional dependence and network structures. Among others, further topics will b=
e the development of monitoring tools to analyze market dynamics around singu=
lar events.In Industry 4.0, the production process in a shop floor consisting of cyber-p=
hysical production systems produces huge amount of data. In addition a curren=
t trend in modern societies is the increased need in personalized products. T=
his aspect increases the number of different product variants and results in =
smaller lot-sizes, which leads to a higher complexity and to dynamic processe=
s. In such dynamic environments exceptions and disruptions are frequent and o=
ften lead to unforeseen situations and possibly negative consequences. Hence,=
 the PhD position focuses on detecting dynamic process changes or unexpected =
disruptions early by exploiting the available data. Moreover, strategies to a=
void negative impacts whenever such disruptions occur have to be developed. S=
uch strategies may apply predictive methods for planning in advance or adopt =
real-time planning approaches with the aim to revise the original plans quick=
ly.In the area of Medical Sciences the goal is to develop new data analysis meth=
ods supporting an integrative view on information originating from different =
sources including medical imaging, genetic data, clinical biomarkers and demo=
graphic data. We will particularly focus on clustering methods supporting the=
 stratification of patient collectives with the long term goal of personalize=
d medicine. As applications we will consider Alzheimer's disease and =
breast cancer.
Applications including:
- Letter of motivation that clarifies the candidate's particular
  domain(s) of interest and the target phd programme
- Curriculum vitae
- List of publications
- Evidence of teaching experience (if available)
- Degree certificates
should be submitted via the Job Center to the University of Vienna (http://jo=
bcenter.univie.ac.at) no later than Apr 30th, 2018, mentioning reference numb=
er 8347._______________________________________________
