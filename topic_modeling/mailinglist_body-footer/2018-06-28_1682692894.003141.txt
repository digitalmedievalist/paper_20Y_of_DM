t.Textual Communities has the following distinctive features:
=C2=B7      It is not an adaptation of any other system, but is built anew fr=
om the ground up;=C2=B7      It understands text as a collection of leaves distributed across =
a document tree and an entity tree. Accordingly, it can both present text pag=
e by page (or line by line), as parts of a document tree, and it can present =
text entity by entity, as a hierarchy of acts of eommunication  (hence, line =
1 of the General Prologue of the Canterbury Tales), as parts of an entity tre=
e;=C2=B7      It offers powerful collation tools, CollateX and the Collation Ed=
itor, permitting precise tailoring of the collation of any entity in muliple =
documents;=C2=B7      It includes tools for managing collaboration: to invite, supervis=
e and monitor multiple collaborators;=C2=B7      It includes an IIIF image server, and can create editiable docume=
nts from IIIF manifests;=C2=B7      It provides an API giving access to all materials through URI res=
ource descriptors.The documentation at https://wiki.usask.ca/display/TC/Textual+Communities off=
