on a piece of hay, with anecdotes about having a whole heap o'
___ back on the farm...I've just finished a conservative diplomatic transcription of
Hall's Chronicle based on the facsimiles of the 1550 ed. online
at Penn.  700,000 words of Hall, about half now annotated and
most of the vocab glossed; it prints out at 1,600 pp.  Yes,
there are things I wish I had done, and now must do
retroactively, without the speed and flexibility allowed during
keyboarding.I designed a nice page-table in Word and did the transcription
line by line (this will make proofreading, crossreferencing,
etc. easy).  A second column has notes.Now, just to sample my wish list:
--I wish I had marked suspected typos as I might correct these
and put a list in an annex.  (It's not easy to spot a typo when
there are a dozen different spellings used for various words,
but after a while you can say with some certainty, Hall never
spelled it *that* way.)--I wish I had marked text in Latin, proverbs and biblical
quotes, and mentions of the stuff of everyday life, like games.OK, I guess I would have coded a Latin phrase something like
        <lq>quid pro quo</lq>What I find mystifying is what happens *then*?  In other words,
what's the use of that?  Suppose I wanted to pull out all the
Latin quotes to give to a starving Latin student to translate.
Who or what even locates all the <lq> coded text, much less does
anything with it?  If a user approached my etext and asked
himself, "I wonder how much Latin is in Hall," how would the
coding help?  How do I as the author tell a user, "I put a lot
of fancy coding into Hall, so just press _____ and bingo!"TEI-L subscribers may know I've had this conceptual block for
some time.  Maybe it's psychological, not wanting to learn a new
foreign language.  Or maybe I just don't relate TEI theory to my
practice.Cheers,
Al Magary
