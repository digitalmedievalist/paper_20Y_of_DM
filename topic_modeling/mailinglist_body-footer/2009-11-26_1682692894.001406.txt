British History Online at the Institute of Historical Research
(http://www.british-history.ac.uk) would like to announce an important
new addition to its premium content section: the Parliament Rolls of
Medieval England (http://www.british-history.ac.uk/prome). This source
consists of scholarly descriptions of every parliament held in England
between 1275 and 1504. It covers 10 monarchs, from Edward I to Henry VII
(since no parliament was held in the reign of Edward V, he is not
included). The rolls for some of these parliaments, particularly the
earlier ones, do not survive, but where they are extant have been fully
transcribed; supplementary material about the business of the parliament
is given in an appendix. Opposite the original text, which may be in
Latin, Anglo-Norman, or Middle English, is a modern English translation.
To make PROME easier to use, the text and translation have been put into
tables, so that the corresponding paragraphs are simple to locate.
