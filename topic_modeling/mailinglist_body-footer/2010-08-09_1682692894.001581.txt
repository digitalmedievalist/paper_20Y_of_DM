Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Daniel,I understand your question of 'preservation of digital content'. As far as my=
 memory serves, it seems to be a Microsoft specific problem. DOC format, nati=
ve to MS, has gone through two 'major' changes in the last two decades, as MS=
 Word goes on improving. The .doc file created by Word 97 was unreadable on o=
lder versions; but the one created by Word 95 and older was readable on Word =
97. It's called downward-compatibility, designed to serve 'business ethic' fo=
r not ruining the valuable digital content. The same problem happened again w=
hen Word 2007 was released. Word 2007 is downward-compatible, whilst Word 200=
7's specific doc files are unreadeable on Word 2003. However, I have no idea =
whether Word 2007 reads the doc files before Word 97 or not.=20Other popular formats have also gone through improvements, though compatibili=
ty issues are barely heard. I remember when I opened a PDF file created by ne=
wer version of Photoshop with an older version programme, the file was proper=
ly opened despite the message 'Some information will lose, etc'. That's why I=
 say the compability issue is probably a MS specific issue.I think, the life of a popular file format, e.g. jpg or mpg, is rather long. =
There was a debate over compatibility when MS was planning its 2nd generation=
 GUI, i.e. Win 95, to succeed Win 3.x. They seem to have come to an agreement=
 about downward-compatibility, as stated. That's why many 20-yr old formats a=
re still in use and 20-yr old files of those formats are still readable. For =
example, JPEG format was there when I was in high school. Now I have no diffi=
culty reading those archaic files on this computer, though their 65k-colour p=
alette violates my eyes.=20I wish I can say something about XML, which is way too modern for a historian=
, um, politically. Personally I like databases and .txt format more than new =
standards, only because I am used to them.So far CD and DVD are the most reliable media. Their life span is longer than=
 15 years as long as they are treated tenderly. Hard Drive is efficient when =
it is cool. It, however, can turn into a nightmare when it is naughty. That's=
 why IT experts suggest everybody to make backup CD/DVDs of the HD. Older har=
ddisks are useable as long as they are with IDE interface and NOT broken. The=
 average life span of the older generation HD, says, 20G, is like 5 years. Do=
n't shake it and don't feed it water, it may live longer. It is hard to tell =
how long IDE interface will survive though, as SATA is getting popular. ZIP d=
rives! It was out in the market for maybe a half year? It was gone immediatel=
y when CD-R was commercialised. Magnetic tapes were terminated by CD-R, too. =
Whatever media you use, regular backup is the rule. Hope this helps.

Subject: [dm-l] Question about preservation of digital content
=20
Dear Digital Medievalists and TEI members,=20I have a question about preservation of digital content especially medieval
manuscripts. I am writing a small article on the topic and I have consulted
a lot sources (papers, handbooks) but most of them do not say anything about
the "life span" of the data in specific formats. To clarify this - a .doc
file crated in 1995. Will be most likely unreadable  in 2010.  What about
other formats? Has anyone done some research on "life span" of a specific
version of digital formats and when it becomes clear that the new version
and the old one are not compatible anymore? And here I am talking about pdf,
rtf, doc (and all office files), djvu, tiff, jpg , mpg etc. (texts and
images especially)=20In my work I am also making a small remark on XML as a data container since
it is, in my opinion, the best way to go and the standard will surely be
around for years. But what kind of steps do you make to ensure the
preservation of documents that have been encoded in xmlI would also like to hear if there are opposing views on xml.I also have the same question about the media. I found some research about
the longevity of CDs and DVDs but I am also interested in other media like
older hard disks, zip drives and magnetic media.I am sorry to bother you with this, but I can use any help I can get=20Thank you in advanceDaniel Mondekar=20=20--===============0974042243274724291==
