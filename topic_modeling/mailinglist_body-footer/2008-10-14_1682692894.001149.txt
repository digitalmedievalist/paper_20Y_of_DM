humanists is Alternate Reality Games (ARGs). Jane McGonigal's work and
installations are one place to start if you'd like a quick grounding,
since she co-designed several major ARGs (see "my games" and "my
research":
 http://www.avantgame.com/Another is interactive fiction, which is not new at all insofar as ADVENT
(Adventure) was programmed in the 1970s:

IF had a renaissance around the late 1990s, however, after Infocom (the
company that produced Zork) was acquired and killed off, which is what
might make it relevant here as "new." Again, for a quick grounding one
could do worse than to start with Emily Short's how-to page, with links
down right-hand sidebar:
 http://emshort.wordpress.com/how-to-play/See also Nick Montfort's work, esp. the "IF" link in the left-hand
sidebar:
 http://nickm.com/Short is (the pseudonym of) a classicist. Montfort's monograph, <i>Twisty
Little Passages</i>, cites the riddles in the Exeter Book as amongst IF's
precursors. IF as a form is distinct from much of the "hypertext"
activity, by the way, though some practitioners cross over.For GPS, try searching on "geocaching" and "KML" (keyhole markup
language).(Also, I might suggest using "simulations" rather than "SIMs," especially
if you plan to use Second Life and Doom as examples for it. I'm used to
seeing the EA / former Maxis games--from SimCity and SimEarth through The
Sims--called simulations, whereas Doom is a first-person shooter. Second
Life is a virtual world, near kin to MMORPGs like World of Warcraft. :)
Your mileage may vary, of course, as we used to say on Usenet!)Cheers,
