makes increasingly use of digital tools. The massive growth of documents
online - as images, as calendars, as texts - and the attempts made to
analyze and discuss diplomatics in the web has motivated us to organize
a second international conference on "Digital Diplomatics". It will take
place in Naples 29.9.-1.10.2011 and we are looking for proposals. You
can find the full presentation of the conference athttp://www.cei.lmu.de/digdipl11/We would like to encourage in particular young scholars and graduate
students to present their ideas and projects on using the new
technologies for studying old documents. Travel grants will be provided.We are looking forward to hear from youfor the organization comiteeGeorg Vogeler--
