ital Edition of Dante's Commedia is now available at https://www.dant=
ecommedia.it. Thanks to the cooperation of its publishers (Fondazione Ezio Fr=
anceschini, https://www.fefonlus.it/index.php/en/, and Inkless Editions, http=
://www.inklesseditions.com), of the libraries holding the manuscripts, of the=
 participating scholars, and of DARIAH-IT, we are able to make the whole edit=
ion available to all free on-line.The edition contains full transcripts and images of seven key manuscripts, to=
gether with the full text of the Petrocchi and Sanguineti editions, a complet=
e word-by-word collation of the texts of the manuscripts and editions, some 5=
00 pages of editorial materials, and analysis and visualizations of the manus=
cript relations using phylogenetic and other digital tools. A specialized var=
iant database (=E2=80=9CVBase=E2=80=9D) enables precise searches for variant =
readings according to their distribution across the tradition.This second edition offers all the data of the first edition, with updated ed=
itorial material, in a completely new interface. Its development was overseen=
 by myself (University of Saskatchewan and Inkless Editions), Lino Leonardi (=
Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa and Fondazione Ezio Franceschini), Prue Shaw (=

and Emiliano Degl'Innocenti (DARIAH-IT).Peter Robinson--===============6675024680899482430==
