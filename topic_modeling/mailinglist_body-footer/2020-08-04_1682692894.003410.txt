Reconsidering the Roman workshop: Applying machine learning to the study of i=
nscribing textsFri, Aug 7, 2020, 17:30 BST
Digital Classicist London Seminar 2020Streamed live at https://youtu.be/sVUg9R13l5EThis paper examines whether our understanding of lettercutting processes in t=
he Roman world can be enhanced through combining traditional scholarship and =
machine learning. The pilot project applies a neural network to a dataset of =
images made available by the Epigraphische Datenbank Heidelberg. We investiga=
te whether the model can learn effectively to identify and measure the layout=
s of inscriptions. In this paper we present the results and implications of t=
he first stage of the project, in which we train the model to recognise text =
within images of varying quality, and discuss the next steps in furthering ou=
r knowledge of Roman craftsmanship.Hosted by the Institute of Classical StudiesALL WELCOME
