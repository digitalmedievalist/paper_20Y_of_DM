Hi Dan and all,Sorry, I was on vacation last week and have only been going through my 
inbox this morning.Marjorie, I believe that the articles listed on the TEI Overlapping 
Markup SIG website provide a good overview of the various approaches to 
handling overlapping markup/overlapping hierarchies: 
http://www.tei-c.org/wiki/index.php/SIG:OverlapFor work done at UK specifically, click down to "Kentucky Goddag." These 
are very technical papers, and mainly touch on methods for querying 
concurrent hierarchies rather than how to represent the concurrent 
hierarchies in markup. The Edition Production Technology, electronic 
editing software developed at UK by Kevin Kiernan through the Electronic 
Boethius and ARCHway projects, with continuing development through eBo, 
expresses overlapping markup through the use of empty elements. It looks 
a bit like HORSE/CLIX, but instead of only "breaking" the elements when 
there is an overlap, all elements are expressed as empty tags, so<p>...</p>becomes<p __tag_type="START"/>...<p __tag_type="END"/>This works well within the context of EPT, but if you're working with 
oXygen (for example), it would be easier to follow James' advice and 
select one hierarchy to take precedence, with the other expressed in 
empty tags. I look forward to HORSE/CLIX's inclusion in P5, it would be 
great to have a canonical method for handling overlaps.Thanks,
Dot--
