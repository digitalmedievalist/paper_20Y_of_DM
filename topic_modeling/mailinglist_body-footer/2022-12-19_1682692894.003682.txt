Call for Papers: The Past, Present, and Future of Digital EditingA conference at the Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel on 25-27 Septe=
mber 2023Internet edition, electronic edition, digital edition=E2=80=A6 numerous terms=
 have been used in recent decades to describe the provision of scholarly text=
s in digital form for research. Patrick Sahle's catalogue<https://www=
.digitale-edition.de/exist/apps/editions-browser/index.html> (v 4.0, 2020ff) =
currently lists 817 =E2=80=9CDigital Scholarly Editions=E2=80=9D. Some of the=
 projects mentioned are available only on CD-ROM. The time span covers the 19=
80s to the present day, with completely different edenda. Consequently there =
are different editorial approaches, and various types of editions and technic=
al realisations. A look at the catalogue clearly shows the dynamics of develo=
pments and thus also the breadth of today's editorial landscape.In 2003, the Herzog August Bibliothek also published its first =E2=80=9CInter=
netedition=E2=80=9D. Beside the provision of previously unpublished letters b=
y Athanasius Kircher<http://diglib.hab.de/edoc/ed000005/startx.htm>, the conc=
eptual focus was on testing textual markup using TEI-XML in a library context=
, in particular the question of integrating original sources and research lit=
erature into the edition. Today, the use of the TEI guidelines can be conside=
red an established standard. But nevertheless: the last decades have also bee=
n marked by numerous changes in the field of scholarly editing. Alongside a p=
luralisation of concepts of text, an expanded range of addressees and (re)use=
 scenarios for editions, as well as new technical possibilities, changed fund=
ing conditions and the emergence of research infrastructures require consider=
ation. Edition projects have to adapt to these parameters.The conference, which will take place from 25-27 September 2023 on the occasi=
on of the 20th anniversary of digital editing at the Herzog August Bibliothek=
 Wolfenbüttel, will focus on the discussion of both theoretical and prac=
tical questions. The aim is to assess the current state of affairs, to includ=
e and critically reflect on past developments, and to shape perspectives for =
the future.The following topics are intended to provide examples of the event's =
focus:  *   historical analysis and assessment of digital editing in the last decad=
es
  *   past, present and future challenges of digital editing in philological =
as well as in technical/practical matters
  *   standardisation vs. innovation
  *   openness vs. closedness
  *   established and innovative software solutions
  *   reflection of an increasingly diversified concept of text and/or expand=
ed user groups and scenarios
  *   opportunities and challenges in the inclusion of other media besides te=
xt and their significance
  *   changing frameworks, contexts (e.g. National Research Data Infrastructu=
res), demands and increasing requirements (e.g. RDM, FAIR and CARE principles)
  *   measures for the FAIRification of digital editions
  *   reception of digital editions and quality assurance
  *   connectivity of ongoing and completed edition projects
  *   lessons learntWe cordially invite researchers from all disciplines to participate in these =
discussions with a presentation of about 20 minutes. The conference language =
is mainly German. Presentations in English are also welcome. We kindly ask yo=
u to submit an abstract of a maximum of 750 words together with a short CV an=
d contact details (email, postal address) to schulz[at]hab.de<http://hab.de> =
by 10 February 2023. Please refrain from merely presenting a specific project=
. The relevance to the overarching theme of the conference should be made cle=
ar in the abstract.The event will be organised in cooperation with the NFDI consortium Text+. A =
publication of proceedings is planned. Subject to the availability of funds, =
travel and accommodation costs for speakers may be covered, at least on a pro=
 rata basis. In order to be able to respond flexibly to potential restriction=
s at the time of the conference, it is planned as a hybrid event.Further information is available on the event page https://events.gwdg.de/eve=
nt/363/, which will be updated regularly.We look forward to your ideas and contributions!If you have any questions, please contact Daniela Schulz (schulz[at]hab.de<ht=
tp://hab.de>).
