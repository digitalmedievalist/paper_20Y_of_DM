course I need to make an edition of a manuscript belonging to my field of exp=
ertise.=20
In my case this is the English Middle Ages. However, after asking many of my =
professors I have not yet come across a satisfying manuscript. Perhaps you ca=
n help me out!
I am looking for a medieval manuscript in the English vernacular (Old/Middle =
English) which had not yet been edited. I am aware this query is far-fetched,=
 but I am willing to try anyway.
With regard to the content of the manuscript, my preference goes out to somet=
hing related to magic, charms, bestiary (cats are a pro), supernatural, roman=
ce ect. However, even if you might happen to know a manuscripts that only inc=
ludes the content preferences, I am very eager to learn about it still. Of co=
urse, the same stands for the first preference: A unedited manuscript with an=
y other content is also very welcome.I hope some of you have suggestions and I am looking forward to your replies.Best regards,J. Feenstra
