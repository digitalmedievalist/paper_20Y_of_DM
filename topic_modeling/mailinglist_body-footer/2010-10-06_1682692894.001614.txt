Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableA possible (additional) problem here is that, with the advent of electronic p=
ublications, we might different "versions" of the same edition (that contain =
the same content).  So unless the Kindle version were the only version, a ref=
erence to a Kindle location might not prove very helpful to the reader trying=
 to locate the referenced content (which is at least one of the relatively si=
gnificant functions of the reference in the first place).For practical purposes, at the moment anyway, I would be inclined to (at leas=
t) supplement any reference to an electronic publication's "location, etc." w=
ith page numbers in a physical book.  However, hopefully, by the time we have=
 more exclusively electronic publications, some kinds of standards for refere=
ncing sections of material will have been developed -- and implemented.Cheers,
