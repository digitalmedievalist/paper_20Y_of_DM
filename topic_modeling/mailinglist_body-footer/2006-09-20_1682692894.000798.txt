l.pdf (warning: 1meg pdf):"Juxta is an open-source cross-platform tool for comparing and collating
multiple witnesses to a single textual work. The software allows users
to
set any of the witnesses as the base text, to add or remove witness
texts,
to switch the base text at will, and to annotate Juxta-revealed
comparisons and save the results.Juxta presents several kinds of analytic visualizations. The most basic
collation offers a split frame comparison of a base text with a witness
text, along with a display of the digital images from which the base
text
is derived. Additionally, Juxta has several visualizations for the
collation
of multiple witnesses. Juxta can display a heat map of the textual
variants that allows the user to locate-at the level of any textual
unit-all witness variations from the base text. Users can also view the
collation as a histogram, which displays the density of all variation
from
the base text and serves as a useful finding aid for variants in long
documents. Finally, Juxta can output a lemmatized schedule (in HTML
format) of the textual variants in any set of comparisons."PeterPeter Binkley
