parent organization, SEENET.  Both were founded by Hoyt Duggan at UVa.
Their websites:   http://www.iath.virginia.edu/seenet/ and
http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/seenet/piers/
<http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/seenet/piers/>
The first contains a listing of SEENET's TEI compliant DTD developed over
the last 14 years.  It's provision for marginalia elements is an important
step.  The PPEA site lists the group's Transcriptional Protocols hammered
out over the same period first for SGML and now adopted for XML markup.
SEENET and the PPEA remain active, publishing documentary editions in CD-ROM
format.regards,
