a new virtual machine at the University of Lethbridge. This should
stop some of the very rare interruptions to the website caused by the
VM not being able to see its remote storage. Moving to the new VM
meant some unforeseen last minute configuration changes, so the
website was up and down a few times this evening. Apologies if any of
you try to load it at that point.  http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/Awhile ago, before the move, we had locked the DM wiki down in
preparation for the move and to give some of our DM Board members a
chance to clean the wiki of some of the spam that was there.  With the
move complete this is now open again! The material in the wiki
http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/wiki needs updating, and so if you
fancy lending a hand, please do so!And while I have your attention a quick reminder that the DM journal
is always on the look-out for articles! Email the editors at:
editors(a)digitalmedievalist.orgDr James Cummings,
University of Oxford
Director of Digital Medievalist
