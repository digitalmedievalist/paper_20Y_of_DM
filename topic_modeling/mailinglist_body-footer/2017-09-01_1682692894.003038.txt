Archival memory: institutions, texts, and shapes
via: https://drd.hypotheses.org/1628Archival memory: institutions, texts, and shapesMedieval charters and archives were a natural component of an=20
institution's memory: acts and deeds constituted primarily a way to k=
eep=20
and preserve the remembrance of a legal or para-legal action for the=20
future. But beyond this evident fact, such documents could also be used=20
to produce, or take part in, specific memorial discourses.Three different levels of granularity are adequate to deal with the=20
issue of =E2=80=9Carchival memory=E2=80=9D: the individual document, the comp=
ilation,=20
and the archives.As for individual documents, foundation charters or deeds which were=20
used as foundation charters by subsequent generations give numerous, yet=20
diverse examples of the building of an archival memory. Single charters=20
could also use a part of their text to directly or indirectly hint at=20
their role as memorial objects, either in a more or less abstract way,=20
or by using historical and pseudo-historical references as an element of=20
their discourse. To name two examples, the preamble of the text was a=20
place where the topic of memory could be developed; and the narratio=20
exposing motives leading to a decision could place them in a historical=20
and memorial context. Graphical components (script, layout, decoration=E2=80=
=A6)=20
may have been implemented as well in a memorial strategy. Silent=20
imitations of previously granted charters, be it in the formulaic=20
components, or in the style, shape, and ornament of the text may be seen=20
as a memorial endeavour: indeed, studies on the influences of chanceries=20
in the handwriting and formulary sometimes take for granted that papal=20
bullae or imperial diplomas were available to be imitated, but the=20
imitation might be an internal issue within the institution. Forgeries=20
may also encompass a graphic and a textual component from the forger'=
s=20
institution, and imitate the ornamental, scribal and textual components=20
of previous in-house productions. Discriminating the inward efficiency=20
(memoria) and the outward efficiency (claims and rights) in order to=20
better understand the aims of such documents is an open field.At a second level, compilations comprise obviously cartularies and=20
=E2=80=9Ccartulary-chronicles=E2=80=9D, but also other =E2=80=9Carchival book=
s=E2=80=9D. Books made out=20
of archival material not only had often an explicit memorial component,=20
but could also develop such a role in an implicit way, born of the=20
selection, arrangement and presentation of the copied material. While=20
much has been done on the most ancient cartularies, compilations from=20
the later Middle Ages are still a relatively new, albeit already=20
studied, field of research in that regard. As well as in individual=20
documents, such compilations could retain graphic elements from their=20
models (figured copies, reproduction of script, monograms and validation=20
marks=E2=80=A6) or add new ones in order to shape and stage the community and=
=20
its memory (illuminations=E2=80=A6).Finally, the way documents were kept, their treatment at the hands of=20
medieval archivists, the way archival =E2=80=9Ccollections=E2=80=9D were orde=
red (or=20
not) gave another possibility for charters to participate in the=20
creation of the memoria of an institution.We welcome proposals for 20 minutes papers exploring the way charters,=20
deeds, acts and related documents as well as their =E2=80=9Cby-products=E2=80=
=9D were=20
used to produce, participate in or reinforce given memorial discourses=20
and/or structures, whether explicitly or implicitly. While memorial=20
aspects of the question should be at the core of the papers, speakers=20
may also reflect on the role such discourses had in the building of=20
identities. These questions may be approached either from the point of=20
view of the production of the documents or focussing on their reception,=20
including their ancient and modern historiographical use.Please send your title, abstract (300 words max.) and affiliation to=20
S=C3=A9bastien Barret (sebastien.barret(a)cnrs-orleans.fr) and Dominique=20
Stutzmann (dominique.stutzmann(a)irht.cnrs.fr) before the 20 September=20
2017. We hope to be able to fund each speaker with approx. 500 =E2=82=AC.
