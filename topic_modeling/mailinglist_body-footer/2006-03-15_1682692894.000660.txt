element is not a member of the class of elements which can appear within 
transribed text. But absolutely no reason why it couldn't be added to an 
existing class or a new one (model.titleLike maybe) in a P5 application, 
or better in a set of proposals for changes to the class system...

specialised tagsets and aims to support very specialist usages within a 
general framework. And changes to it have to come from within its user 
community, of which after all DM is a major constituent.--===============5463653444828083095==--
