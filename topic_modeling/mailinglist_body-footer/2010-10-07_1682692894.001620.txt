indeed, probably any work that was well known before the age of print (just
as Heinrich Kuhn illustrates in his message).For works born in the print era, and especially those locked down by
copyright to one edition at a time with a single publisher, page numbers
have always seemed natural and convenient.  But as more and more works
appear in many different formats all at once, and where print is just one of
many ways to access a work, it's apparent that a page number is no longer
necessarily the most reliable, or even useful, citation.  I think that in a
post-print age (by which I mean not a world without print, but a world where
print is one of many options) we'll eventually begin to cite all works as we
already do works for which "no standard edition exists (or which is
available in many manuscripts)"Best,
