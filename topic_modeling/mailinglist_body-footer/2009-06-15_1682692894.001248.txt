at the International Medieval Congress at Leeds. The session title is
"New Work in Digital Medieval Studies: Visualization and
Interpretation" and it is sponsored by the Medieval Academy of
America's Committee on Electronic Resources.If you will be attending Leeds and you have a paper prepared that
would suit this session, please send me a title and short abstract
ASAP. We'll also be advertising for papers on the IMC's official "last
minute CFP" page.Many thanks,
Dot (session organizer)--
