Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableHi all,a couple of weeks ago I promised to enter a project description of the
dMGH into the dm-l wiki.Finally, I managed to create a short page:<http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/DMGH_%28digital_Monumenta_Germaniae_=
Historica%29>(It's linked to from the "Projects"-page.)This is roughly a translation of our starting page at
<http://www.dmgh.de>, which unfortunately is only available in German
(as is our whole project site so far, but most of our texts are Latin
anyway ;-) ). But note that it's not meant to be a literal translation.Usually I would not announce changes to the wiki on the list, but as the
subject has already been on the list a few weeks ago, I thought this was
appropriate.Also, this is meant to be an invitation -- especially for native English
speakers -- to correct any obvious mistakes and any awkward phrases or
word positions. I'm not sure when we are going to be able to present an
internationalized version of the dMGH, so this page will probably serve
as the major English reference to the dMGH for quite some time. Thanks
for your help.Cheers,Clemens--=20
