, currently under strong consideration by Amsterdam University Press, discuss=
ing the problems and opportunities of digital methods and tools for the speci=
fic humanistic problems scholars working with medieval texts and materials fa=
ce. You do not have to self-identify as a digital humanities scholar to contr=
ibute =E2=80=93 only have an interest in what is made possible by these new m=
ethodologies or a project you are working on that includes a digital element.=
  It is also our desire that the volume becomes a conversation, and as such w=
e would like all authors writing for the volume to read and comment on the ot=
her chapters when the topics are of interest.If you have an idea for a chapter that you think might fit the planned outlin=
e of the book, attached below, please send an abstract of your proposed chapt=
er (roughly a page) to matthew(a)matthewedavis.net <mailto:matthew(a)matthewe=
davis.net> by December 1st.  Our plan is that all chapters will be completed =
and in the editors hands by November of 2015 and the completed volume, includ=
ing commentary, will be in the hands of the publishers by March of 2016.Thank you,

The book will be organized into four broad categories intended to reflect the=
 practice of digital humanities in medieval studies, and reflecting our desir=
e to explore both the contributors' work on digital medieval projects=
 and their thoughts on how digital tools and methods have changed medieval st=
udy. These categories should not be seen as an attempt to wall off methods of=
 scholarship =E2=80=93 the intention of the volume is that the contributed pi=
eces will be in dialogue with each other =E2=80=93 but to place thematically =
similar pieces in proximity to each other. The categories are:=20=E2=80=A2	Texts and Contexts
The binary foundation of the digital =E2=80=93 the zero and one or off and on=
 at the heart of it =E2=80=93 causes its division into discrete pieces. That =
tendency them migrates up the chain of data categorization, placing those dis=
crete items into their own pigeonholes. Those things that resist neat categor=
ization or binary distinction have a tendency to be lost, and that loss will =
only increase as more and more analog cultural artifacts are described and ca=
tegorized digitally. Those chapters in the Texts and Contexts section are thu=
s concerned not only with the content of a work =E2=80=93 things intentionall=
y placed such as the text of a poem, the image of an artistic work or sculptu=
re, or the presentation layer of a website =E2=80=93 but with the ancillary e=
lements that define, or once defined, the context of the work and which are e=
qually important to its production and understanding.=20
=E2=80=A2	Things and Spaces
Complementary to the question of text and context is one of representation: h=
ow do you represent a three-dimensional object, with its real, physical prese=
nce, in an essentially two-dimensional digital construct presented on a scree=
n? Should there be large- scale visualization spaces available so that indivi=
duals can =E2=80=98walk' inside a scale representation of a medieval =
cathedral, for example, and if so how should the cathedral be represented? Sh=
ould its artificial nature be occluded in an attempt at true verisimilitude o=
r should it be acknowledged and the real and physical privileged? Furthermore=
, our relationships with virtual representations of small objects, such as co=
dices, appear on the surface to be well-trod ground but in fact their reconst=
ruction forces us to think anew about concepts such as reception and memory. =
The chapters in this section engage with the presentation of objects as objec=
ts, with their own physicality and cultural weight, and question how best to =
both engage with and honor all of those aspects digitally.=20
=E2=80=A2	Tools and Techniques
Because very few digital tools and platforms are actually built for humanitie=
s questions, much less the specific questions that medievalists working with =
those tools might ask, there is a tension between what the researcher wants f=
rom the tool, what the tool can do, and what the tool might be reasonably be =
made able to do. The chapters in this category deal primarily with the techni=
cal opportunities and issues of using computational tools to do medieval huma=
nities scholarship. What exactly are the underlying implications of choosing =
a particular metadata standard =E2=80=93 can such choices be seen as =E2=80=
=98neutral'? In choosing a tool such as TEI or creating an algorithm =
to track word usage across a corpus, to what are scholars committing themselv=
es, and what are they discarding?=20=E2=80=A2	Collaborations
Due to the nature of training in the humanities and the hardware and software=
 packages necessary to undertake a digital project, there are very few schola=
rs who can engage in a digital project alone. Thus, unlike the traditional mo=
del of the lone scholar working on a monograph, digital scholarship tends bot=
h to be collaborative and to require significant funding. The scholar who man=
ages such a project faces two interrelated challenges: first, that the projec=
t not exceed its original scholarly intent =E2=80=93 a condition known to the=
 programming community as =E2=80=9Cscope creep.=E2=80=9D Second, that all mem=
bers of the collaborative team be rewarded in the ways that are meaningful to=
 their particular discipline =E2=80=93 a CV line for the scholar, a service i=
tem or additional technical tool for a library employee, or a particularly ch=
allenging technical =E2=80=9Chack=E2=80=9D that can then be used elsewhere or=
 foregrounded on the resume for the programmer. The chapters in this section =
discuss specific pitfalls involved in trying to explain and justify a medieva=
lly-focused digital project to the larger funding structures of an institutio=
n.=20Intentionally broad, these categories are not designed to be traditionally di=
sciplinary. Instead, our aim is that they reflect the interdisciplinary natur=
e of some of the best digital humanities projects, the holistic nature of med=
ieval culture that has been artificially divided by modern disciplinary bound=
aries, and the push towards interdisciplinary scholarship in the academy. Fur=
thermore, by suggesting an alternate way of thinking about the objects of our=
 study and the scholarship produced, notions that this =E2=80=9Cisn't=
 my area=E2=80=9D are abolished and discussions amongst the participants =E2=
=80=93 either in the volume itself or in an ancillary website =E2=80=93 are f=
ostered.=20We are envisioning roughly sixteen chapters to the volume divided amongst the=
 four categories, with a different author writing each chapter. After complet=
ing their chapters the authors will be encouraged to read and comment on each=
 other's work, and that conversation will be included in the volume a=
nd hopefully on an ancillary, ongoing website forum.--===============8455233441115273140==
