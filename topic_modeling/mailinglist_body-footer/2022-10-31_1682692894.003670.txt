With this special issue of the Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities =
(JDMDH), we wish to bring together in one single volume several experiments, =
projects and reflections related to automatic text recognition on historical =

unity to all those who wish to make their own contribution to the field or to=
 share their experience by exposing their successes, their questions and thei=
r difficulties, or even failure. By publishing this special issue, we hope to=
