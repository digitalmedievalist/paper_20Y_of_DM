the willingness they have shown thus far to share techniques, tools, and 
examples with the list. It was exactly to get this kind of interchange 
that we set dm-l(a)uleth.ca up. We hope to collect these tips and tools as 
soon as the website is up, and encourage you to consider submitting 
project reports, notes, and research articles to the Digital Medievalist 
journal (about which more next week).I would also encourage those with questions to share those as well. The 
community of practice model suggests that questions--even quite basic 
questions--are very useful in fostering the development of a community's 
skills. The provoke others into considering techniques in new ways and 
foster the sharing of expertise. I hope to follow up our discussion of 
what we might want to see in a primer next week as well.
