Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit From the reactions yesterday, it became apparent them many institutions 
and systems worldwide are blocking port 8080 traffic. For the current 
Graves project that's not a problem, because it's in early phases and not 
really "public" yet, but it did surprise me; it's the default port for 
Tomcat, I think. It's taught me that when we move it to a more stable 
location, we need to set up an alias in Apache so that all Tomcat and eXist 
sites are channeled through Apache and so appear to come from port 80.The "PHP works" page is served by Apache on port 80, so that's not a problem.Cheers,
