Linking Images and Text in Digital Editions of Vetusta Monumenta
Abstract: Published by the Society of Antiquarians of London Vetusta Monument=
a is a compendium of text and images describing and representing ancient arti=
facts and buildings from Europe (primarily England).  Created over a number o=
f years multiple volumes and editions of the work exist, three of which now r=
eside in Ellis Library, Special Collections, at the University of Missouri Co=
lumbia.  Although high quality scans have been made, currently only limited d=
escriptive, administrative or technical metadata exists. In an effort to reme=
dy this situation a group of librarians and English Department faculty have b=
egun collaborating to synthesize scholarly and historical commentary with ima=
ges in order to explore the potential of linked data. Beginning as a 'simple'=
 digital libraries project, it has since evolved into an exploration of the p=
otential for descriptive metadata to enhance the value of digitized materials.
In particular, this project has made it necessary to ask: how should images a=
nd text interact in a digital library? Over the past decade questions like th=
is have catalyzed a concerted exploration of information seeking behaviors in=
 digital environments. While systems for negotiating text or images exist, ea=
ch schema, protocol or controlled vocabulary is rather specialized and, thus,=
 depends on users acquiring information or visual literacy skills - as oppose=
d to a synthesis of the two. The collaboration between librarians and scholar=
s has made it possible to re-contextualize the idea of linked data by directl=
y linking scholarship to the materials it references. Using the Visual Resour=
ce Associations (VRA) VRA Core schema and Cataloging Cultural Objects content=
 standard it has been possible to exploit the accuracy and extensibility of O=
CLCs Dublin Core schema through the use of SCALAR, a new digital library inte=
rface developed by the University of Southern California.  As an ongoing proj=
ect participants are endeavoring to use the digital surrogates of images to e=
nhance the readability and value of written scholarship by associating text a=
nd images in an innovate manner.Bio: Kristen is currently a second year doctoral student in the School of Inf=
ormation Science and Learning Technologies at the University of Missouri Colu=
mbia. Her experiences as a librarian have primarily consisted of metadata man=
agement in visual resource departments, which has been quite useful in her cu=
rrent work and research in the area of digital humanities. She began collabor=
ating with the English Department last spring to develop a digital edition of=
 three volumes of Vetusta Monumenta, an antiquarian text of prints and essays=
 on ancient British monuments published by the Society of Antiquaries of Lond=
on.--===============0081815642661474066==
