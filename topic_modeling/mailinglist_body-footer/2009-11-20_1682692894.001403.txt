Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableI generally agree with you James. And as I said, I really don't have an=20
intuitive sense of what it is like to feel intimidated on a list or in a=20
lecture--I tend to get annoyed rather than scared. But all that being=20
said, enough people raise the issue about even quite innocuous=20
places--like tei-l, dm-l, humanist, ansax-l--that it has to be accepted=20
as a real issue.I think myself that there are countervailing imperatives at work. On the=20
one hand, there is a sense in which academia is where the purists live=20
and one shouldn't get involved if one would rather not have one's work=20
and performance open to criticism--including sometimes quite fundamental=20
criticism. Moreover not all academics are equally endowed with the=20
social graces... so you need to be prepared for some rough and tumble,=20
including sometimes harshly phrased and sometimes even spiteful criticism.However, the other imperative is that academics should not glory in=20
rudeness. I'm sure we have all experienced criticism that is insightful,=20
perhaps fundamental, and not cruel. And criticism that is cruel without=20
being particularly right or helpful. Just like listservs seemed to bring=20
out bizarre behaviour in academics 20 years ago, twitter seems to=20
already have created a couple circumstances where people have confused=20
"duty to criticise" with "licence to be an A**H***." That example that=20
Lou cited for example from the Chronicle, seems to me to be a case where=20
there was legitimate reason for complaint that unleashed the inner=20
monster in more than a couple of people. I imagine a lot of pictures in=20
a lot of attics aged considerably over the course of that lecture.So I do feel that one can be fundamentally critical, but one ought to=20
try to be constructive and avoid unnecessary rudeness. I know as an=20
editor, I find the negative reviews that realise that authors are human=20
beings whose papers are flawed rather than flawed human beings are far=20
more useful all round. I agree with Gaby that nothing can control this,=20
and I think the idea of opening up a new communication channel at=20
conferences and the like is really exciting and powerful. But I think=20
that we as the twits involved ought to try and remember that real people=20
with real mothers and fathers are readings our contributions.-dan
