My responses:I like a wiki as a clearing house of DM projects more than a blog.  The
spam sounds like more an issue of how the wiki is set up than the
technology itself.  I have no problem either combining or cross listing
with the DC wiki and community as there is (and should be!) a good deal
of cross over.  To encourage participation in the wiki: 1) grad students and interested
undergrads could be given internships at our own institutions with the
purpose of writing articles for the wiki. Thus, I, as member of the
community, would have a summer intern (for credit) and have this student
use and write up projects for the wiki and submit them.  This gives the
student some refereed publications, and also seeds things for the
future.....getting a student involved so that the next generation of
Digital Medievalists is growing and coming of age in direct relationship
with this community 2) grows the Wiki as a clearing house for DM
projects.  I agree that the bylaws can/should be changed so that the board is not
locked into a single technology.  But I think that the issue is not
really the technology, but the humans.  I'd be disappointed to see the journal move to a hosting site.  I'm not
sure of what advantages there are and I can see a number of
disadvantages.  But then I have strong opinions about what we can do in
electronic academic publishing and what we are doing.  Recognizing that in an organization like ours where we charge no
membership fees also means that we have no money to pay someone to
undertake tasks such as coding webpages etc and so on, this means of
necessity depending on the generosity of someone to do it.  And again
this is an opportunity to cultivate the next generation of digital
medievalists rather than sticking James or Dan with it.  Our success
depends on our personal involvement, and how we can plug our students
into involvement, and I for one have really not been aware of how to do
that beyond being a board member.  As a once and future editor of an
online journal in the field and chair, I need to know some specifics and
where to put student energy to help out both organizations.I think there are other and better solutions to the problems outlined.--
