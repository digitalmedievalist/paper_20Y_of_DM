Digital Age: the Emma B. Andrews Diary Project*
Sarah Ketchley (University of Washington)Between 1889 and 1914, Mrs. Emma B. Andrews traveled the Nile with 
millionaire lawyer turned archaeologist, Theodore M. Davis, and was 
present when he discovered 18 of the 42 tombs now known in the Valley of 
the Kings. Her as yet unpublished diaries are a significant resource for 
the history of archaeology and Egyptology during this period. This paper 
will discuss the development of an extensive historical and biographical 
database based both on Emma’s record and related archival material, and 
the subsequent development of data visualizations of contemporary social 
networks and interactive digital maps recreating Davis’s excavations and 
archaeological finds.Livecast: https://youtu.be/PLYael0qYvQFull abstract: http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2017-07sk.htmlALL WELCOME
