as scholarly editions in digital form are dear to many of us: this  
seems an appropriate place to notify the publication of two new  
digital editions.  They are:
Prue Shaw's edition of Dante's Monarchia.  This is particularly  
significant for two reasons:
a.  it is the first of a projected series of publications of italian  
medieval texts.  Details of further publications currently in  
preparation will be given in a session at this year's Kalamazoo, by  
Prue Shaw, Bill Colman and Edvige Agostinelli.
b.  it is a co-publication with the Societa Dantesca Italiana, who  
arranged all image permissions for both DVD and internet  
publication.  This sets an important precedent: it would have been so  
difficult, as to have been impossible, for any publisher to have  
arranged this.  As the premier Dante scholarly association, SDI was  
perfectly placed to do this.  What they have done for Dante, other  
scholarly associations might do for other authors.
Paul Thomas's edition of the Nun's Priest's Tale.   As well as being  
the fourth 'single-tale' publication from the Canterbury Tales  
Project (www.canterburytalesproject.org), it is the first by a  
project partner: and again, we hope, an excellent precedent.
Details of these, with links to online samples, can be found at  
www.sd-editions.com -- which is also offering a nice pre-publication  
price for both editions.
Best wishes
