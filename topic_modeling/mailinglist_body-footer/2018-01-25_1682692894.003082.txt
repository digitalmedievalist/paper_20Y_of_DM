We invite applications for a five-day training workshop in text encoding
for epigraphyand papyrology, and publication of ancient texts, at the Institute of
Classical Studies,University of London, April 9–13, 2018.The training will be offered by Gabriel Bodard (ICS), Martina Filosa
(Köln),Simona Stoyanova (ICS) and Polina Yordanova (ICS/Sofia)and there will be no charge for the workshop. Thanks to the generosityof the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, a limited number of bursariesare available to assist students and other unfunded scholars with the costs
of traveland accommodation.EpiDoc (epidoc.sf.net <http://epidoc.sourceforge.net/>) is a community of
practice, recommendations and toolsfor the digital editing and publication of ancient texts based on TEI XML.EFES (github.com/EpiDoc/EFES) is a publication platform closely gearedto EpiDoc projects and designed for use by non-technical editors.No expert computing skills are required, but a working knowledgeof Greek/Latin or other ancient language, epigraphy or papyrology,and the Leiden Conventions will be assumed. The workshop is opento participants of all levels, from graduate students to professors and
professionals.To apply for a place on this workshop please email gabriel.bodard(a)sas.ac.uk,
