Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableHi all,I'll add my perspective from working in digital libraries and from working on=
 the St Gall Monastery Virtual Library (http://www.stgallplan.org/). Pan and =
zoom is my preferrered viewing interface. We use zoomify in our application, =
but just because it's our best choice right now. The biggest drawback is the =
flashviewer. Rules out ipad and iphone users from even knowing the images exi=
st. So we're interested in going with jpeg 2000 and we will through the islan=
dora package soon. I'm curious to hear others findings about Jpeg2000.Best,Lisa McAulay

te:> I am excited to see discussion on this topic.  We host an online repository=
 of images, transcriptions, and collation tools for scholars doing text criti=
cism on the New Testament.  Often, holding institutions of the ~5600 manuscri=
pt copies will not give us permission to house digital images on our own site=
, but insist on us feeding the images to our users from their website.  This =
makes providing a seamless experience for our users a challenging task.

> Our system is composed of a suite of OpenSocial gadgets and one of those ga=
dgets is an image viewer which provides drag to pan, wheel (or 2 fingers up/d=
own on a mac) to zoom, brightness/contrast adjust, box annotations, and persi=
stent URLs back to an adjusted view.  It's all javascript and requires no ser=
ver side or extra client side components beyond the web browser and can view =
remote URLs for pretty much any image with a link on the internet.  It's all =
freely available for your use-- easy dropin if you're working inside an opens=
ocial container, or we have a standalone version too which is a simple popup =
webpage.

eddable External Viewer Link To This Image") to generate a return link to you=
r view of the image.

o avoid that one unless you create an account)
>=20

 viewing an image in the image viewer.  You simply install the plugin, browse=
 to any internet page with an image in which you are interested in, and then =
on the plugin, press "Annotate".  It's crude and assumes the largest image on=
 the page is the one you'd are interested in, but mostly does what our users =
expect.  It can read images from some sites which use custom viewers by pieci=
ng tiles together, but mostly the images must be simple jpg, png, gif images.

came to the session correctly identified which ones were which out of each se=
t. In my view, what we really need are some standards and accurate guidelines=
 and I am researching this area at the moment. For example, not many people r=
ealise that some pre-digital transparencies are between 2,000 and 4,000 lines=
 resolution (lpi) which puts many digital cameras in the shade.
>>=20
>> Moving to your question, I think the important thing to understand is that=
 screen resolutions are still extremely low when compared with (say) printer =
resolutions. For example a typical laptop screen at 1024x768 is between 75dpi=
 and 100dpi depending on the physical screen size. Many modern mobile phone/s=
mart phone dpi tends to be around 150dpi. Of course these are all generalisat=
ions and there are many web based calculators such as http://tiporama.com/too=
ls/pixels_inches.html which can give you a better idea of resolution capabili=
ty on a device by device basis. Compare that with an EPSON printer at 1440dpi=
 horizontal resolution and you will understand and appreciate the comparison.=
 So it is important to understand that the image you display at any one time =
on the screen can be relatively low (for performance reasons), but the underl=
ying source image (the original scan) needs to be high and lossless to allow =
the best level of zoom as you move closer and closer into the page.

) at any one time but then I also want to be able to zoom into sections of th=
e manuscript and then down to the individual characters (without pixellation)=
  to determine if that character really is an "S" or an "A" (palaeographers w=
ill get the joke here). The problem with most lossy compressions is that the =
'big picture' is great but, as you zoom in, you start to see significant degr=
adation of the image (a by-product of the way the compression is done) which =
gets in the way of scholarly interpretation. For example take a high resoluti=
on TIFF image, compress it at various JPG levels and then print it full page =
on a high resolution printer. You will find that all the samples are virtuall=
y indistinguishable from each other until you bring out a magnifying glass an=
d then all will become depressingly clear in terms of the drop in image quali=
ty/fidelity at the lowest file sizes.

>> As other contributors have indicated, there are various solutions (e.g. ht=
tp://djvu.org/resources/whatisdjvu.php and Virtual Vellum) which can also hel=
p, but the resolution, compression and colour depth of the underlying image i=
s still key. As James implies, it is also important to select a software solu=
tion that has longevity and is not going to disappear or change once your res=
earch project is completed. There are a number of Flash based viewers around =
but (as James also implies), Adobe's track record at maintaining backward com=
patibility (and even retaining technology) has not been that great in the pas=
t. Having said that, Adobe Flash has installations that run into at least the=
 tens of millions so it is unlikely to disappear overnight but we all know Ap=
ple's stance on Adobe Flash!
>>=20
>> So in closing, I think the most important thing to ensure, for any manuscr=
ipt project at least, is that the underlying image is at the highest resoluti=
on possible (lossless) and the capabilities to zoom into 'snapshots' of that =
image are flexible in terms of the zoom factors allowed. However, the image '=
snapshot' that gets displayed at any one time on the screen can be relatively=
 low for optimal performance but it still needs to be an accurate subset of t=
he original image and as a result downscaling resolution from a lossy compres=
sed original is unlikely to work very well. As I recall, this downscaling is =
something that Virtual Vellum does well as does Photoshop of course but to id=
entify one of the many tools and plug-in's which operate in a similar and app=
ropriate way for your particular needs and custom website will of course need=
 your further research.

d high-resolution tiff images, which I'm publishing with a "magnifying glass"=
 overlay. This is in a "responsive" context, so the components of the page, i=

site up to production quality, and I would be grateful for advice about how t=
o manage the images, an area where I don't have much (=3D any) knowledge of b=
est practice. I'd like small image files that load quickly, and I think I don=
't mind slightly lossy compression if that would reduce the file size substan=
tially--but if that's a mistake, I'd be grateful for a warning. I think there=
 are two questions:
>>=20
>> 1. What's an appropriate file format and resolution (size, dpi, color dept=
h, etc.) for the base image, the one that is displayed in full to the right o=
f the transcription, and that resizes as the user resizes the window? Current=
ly the image files are in jpg format and vary in size from about 2M down to 2=
50k. I can regenerate them all at a common size, resolution, color depth, etc=
. from the original tiffs, but I don't know whether there is any sense of bes=
t practice concerning what that size should be. If I go the lossy route, what=
's a reasonable value?
>>=20
>> 2. What's an appropriate degree of magnification for the magnifying-glass =
inset view? Currently the magnifying glass inset always shows the image at 20=
0% of the actual file size (not the size of the page as displayed without mag=
nification in the browser window!). You can see the difference by comparing, =
say, folio 30v (about 2MB) to 284r (about 270k), where the magnification is m=
uch greater in the former than the latter. I can set the level of magnificati=
on anywhere I'd like, but is there any agreement about best practice here?
>>=20
>> By way of orientation in the question: the purpose of the full image is to=
 allow the user to see the image conveniently alongside the transcription, ve=
rifying any moments where our editorial judgment might appear surprising or q=
uestionable. The point of the magnified inset is to let the user examine deta=
ils that may not be visible at lesser magnification, such as erasures, correc=
tions, etc. My casual impression is that 30v looks pretty good and loads reas=
onably quickly (although quicker would be better), but I don't place great co=
nfidence in my own casual impressions.
