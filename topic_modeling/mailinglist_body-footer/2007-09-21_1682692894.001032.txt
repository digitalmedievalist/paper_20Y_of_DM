February 28-March 2, 2008
The Ohio State UniversityVAGANTES is an annual, traveling conference for graduate students
studying any aspect of the Middle Ages. The conference was conceived
with several goals in mind, which include fostering of a sense of
community among medievalists in the beginning stages of their careers,
providing exposure to an interdisciplinary forum, and showcasing the
resources of the host institutions, all at minimal cost to graduate
students.The seventh conference will be hosted by the graduate medievalists at
Ohio State University February 28-March 2, 2008. This year's featured
speakers will be Barbara Hanawalt, King George III Chair of British
History at The Ohio State University, and Elaine Treharne, Professor of Old
and Early Middle English at Florida State University.Abstracts for twenty-minute papers are welcome from graduate students
on any topic dealing with the Middle Ages, including areas outside the
Latin West. Presenters should orient their talks to a broad
medievalist audience.Please send a brief CV and abstract of no more than 300 words by
October 15, 2007 to:Jennifer Gianfalla
