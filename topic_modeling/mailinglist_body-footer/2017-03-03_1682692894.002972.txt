---- First International Workshop on Resources and Tools for Derivational Mor=
phology (DeriMo2017) ----FIRST CALL FOR PAPERSThe First International Workshop on Resources and Tools for Derivational Morp=
hology (DeriMo2017) will be held in Milan (Italy) on 5 and 6 October 2017, at=
 the Universit=C3=A0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (http://http://derimo2017.marg=
inalia.it/).DeriMo2017 concludes the Word Formation Latin (WFL) project, funded by the Eu=
ropean Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under t=
he Marie Sk=C5=82odowska-Curie grant agreement No 658332-WFL. The project is =
based at the Centro Interdisciplinare di Ricerche per la Computerizzazione de=
i Segni dell'Espressione (CIRCSE: http://centridiricerca.unicatt.it/c=
ircse-home?rdeLocaleAttr=3Den), at the Universit=C3=A0 Cattolica del Sacro Cu=
ore, Milan, Italy.Submissions are invited for presentations featuring high quality and previous=
ly unpublished research on the topics described below. Contributions should f=
ocus on results from completed as well as ongoing research, with an emphasis =
on novel approaches, methods, ideas, and perspectives, whether descriptive, t=
heoretical, formal or computational.Proceedings will be published, open-access, in time for the workshop.
MOTIVATION AND AIMS
Until very recently, in the areas of Language Resources and Natural Language =
Processing (NLP), derivational morphology has always been neglected if compar=
ed to inflectional morphology. Yet the recent rise of lexical resources for d=
erivational morphology have demonstrated that enhancing textual data with der=
ivational morphology tagging can lead to strong outcomes.
First, it organises the lexicon at higher level than words, by building word =
formation based sets of lexical items sharing a common derivational ancestor.
Secondly, derivational morphology acts like a kind of interface between morph=
ology and semantics, since core semantic properties are shared at different e=
xtent by words built by a common word formation process.In the lively area of research aimed at building computational resources and =
tools for ancient languages, the WFL project fills a gap in the variety of th=
ose available for Latin, connecting lexical items on the basis of word format=
ion rules. For a work-in-progress version of the resource, please visit http:=
//wfl.marginalia.it.
This workshop wants to be both an opportunity for the presentation of WFL to =
the wider community, and a place where confrontation with other scholars enga=
ged in the treatment of derivational morphology for different languages (eith=
er modern or ancient) can arise, and potentials for the cross-linguistic shar=
ing of techniques and methods can be discussed.=20
TOPICSThe Workshop on Resources and Tools for Derivational Morphology aims at cover=
ing a wide range of topics.In particular, the topics to be addressed in the workshop include (but are no=
t limited to) the following:
- resources for derivational morphology
- connecting the derivational morphology level of annotation in language reso=
urces with other levels of linguistic analysis (e.g. semantic, syntactic=E2=
=80=A6)
- (NLP) tools for the semi-automatic creation of resources for derivational m=
orphology
- (NLP) tools including components of derivational morphology
- empirically based comparative and multilingual studies on derivational morp=
hology
- empirically based diachronic studies on derivational morphology
- query tools for derivational morphology resources
- theoretical issues in derivational morphology.
INVITED SPEAKER: Pius ten Hacken (University of Innsbruck, Austria)
IMPORTANT DATESDeadlines: always midnight, UTC ('Coordinated Universal Time'), ignoring DST =
('Daylight Saving Time'):- Deadline for paper submission: 18 June 2017
- Notification of acceptance: 24 July 2017
- Final, camera-ready, version of paper: 10 September 2017
- Workshop: 5-6 October 2017
INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSIONWe invite to submit long abstracts describing original, unpublished research =
related to the topics of the workshop. Abstracts should not exceed 6 pages (r=
eferences included).
The language of the workshop is English. All abstracts must be submitted in w=
ell-checked English.Abstracts should be submitted in PDF format only. Submissions have to be made=
 via the EasyChair page of the workshop at https://easychair.org/conferences/=
?conf=3Dderimo2017. Please, first register at EasyChair if you do not have an=
 EasyChair account.
The style guidelines to follow for the paper can be found here: http://derimo=
2017.marginalia.it/index.php/CfP/authors-kit.Please, note that as reviewing will be double-blind, the abstract should not =
include the authors' names and affiliations or any references to web-sites, p=
roject names etc. revealing the authors' identity. Furthermore, any self-refe=
rence should be avoided. For instance, instead of "We previously showed (Brow=
n, 2001)...", use citations such as "Brown previously showed (Brown, 2001)...=
".
Each submitted abstract will be reviewed by three members of the programme co=
mmittee.The authors of the accepted abstracts will be required to submit the full ver=
sion of their paper, which may be extended up to 10 pages (references include=
d).
ORAL PRESENTATIONSThe oral presentations at the workshop will be 30 minutes long (25 minutes fo=
r presentation and 5 minutes for questions and discussion).
