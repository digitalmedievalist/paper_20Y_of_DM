http://ahds.ac.uk/workshops/* London, 3rd May 2006
* Manchester, 10th May 2006The Arts and Humanities Data Service is running a series of workshops
designed to introduce projects to the key issues in digitisation. These are
updated versions of previous workshops run by the AHDS.Many projects applying for funding or commencing digitisation are unsure of
how to manage or deal with the various elements involved in the creation of
digital data. The AHDS Digitisation Workshops aim to cover each of the
relevant themes, giving delegates a coherent idea of how they should be
organising their projects. This includes    * Funding and Managing Projects
    * Data Capture
    * Metadata and Documentation
    * Depositing and Disseminating Resources
    * CopyrightStaff from each of the AHDS Subject Centres will be present on the day and
delegates may book surgery sessions with AHDS staff to speak about the
issues facing their own project. Informal lunch and coffee breaks will also
give delegates the chance to speak to AHDS staff and other delegates that
are present.The workshops are open to any institution or individual who is planning or
running a digitisation project, but they may be of special interest to those
who are preparing an application for one of the funding schemes organised by
the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the Joint Information Systems
Committee or the British Academy.http://ahds.ac.uk/workshops/AlastairAlastair Dunning
