COST Action IS1005 'Medioevo Europeo'
Münster (Germany), 3 & 4 October 2014Comparison and collation are part of the primitives of textual
scholarship—as John Unsworth has dubbed the generic and basic tasks of this
field. They are tedious, error prone, and subject to unwitting bias, and
the quest for formalized ways of guiding these tasks is as old, if not
older, than philology itself. The last thirty years have seen the adoption
of several digital approaches to textual collation, from
heuristics-supported Collate to fully algorithmic Juxta. What is the
current state of the art of digital collation? How do we apply it to
manuscript texts? Does CollateX turn collation into a solved problem? What
are the prospects for multilingual collation? It is these kind of questions
that underlie a research summit on collation to be held in Münster on 3 and
4 October 2014.The COST Action IS1005 'Medioevo Europeo' (http://www.medioevoeuropeo.org/)
has kindly offered funding to organize this focused research summit on
(digital) collation for ancient, medieval manuscript, and early print
texts. This summit is kindly hosted by the Institute für Neutestamentliche
Textforschung (INTF) of the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität in Münster (
http://egora.uni-muenster.de/intf/index_en.shtml), representing a wealth of
knowledge and experience on the collation of witnesses for the Greek New
Testament.This summit will allow the participants to inform themselves about the
issues, methods, and tools involved with collating older texts for
scholarly purposes. The summit will feature some of the most prominent
scholars in this area who will offer an overview of scholarly theory
underpinning collation, the history of digital support for this scholarly
task, and the praxis of current collation techniques. The summit will also
offer a intensive hands-on training in digital collation by
researcher/developers that were involved in building CollateX (
http://collatex.net), Juxta (http://www.juxtasoftware.org/), and several
other tools for scholarly editing.The second day of the summit features a day long clinic for participants
who apply collation in their scholarly research. We offer the possibility
for participants to present both theoretical and practical problems and
solutions for collating old texts. We invite them to show their work,
tools, problems, needs, and results of applied collation in scholarly
editing.
== HOW TO PARTICIPATE ==This unique research summit is open for participation by all scholars and
developers involved in the application of (digital) collation of older
texts. There are two ways to attend: as a regular attendee or as a
presenter of a collation use case during the clinics on the second day of
the research summit. We highly encourage participants to present their
collation related work during one of the clinics. To do so send a statement
of interest and short description of your proposed contribution to the
clinic (no more than 300 words) to joris.van.zundert(a)huygens.knaw.nl.
Deadline of submission is August 1, 2014.As we seek to encourage the participation of early-stage researchers (PhD
students or post-doctoral researchers), a limited number of bursaries are
available to cover travel expenses. If you wish to apply for one of these,
please submit an additional statement motivating your application (main
criteria are importance of this workshop for your current research and
absence of other possible funding). Abstracts and applications for
bursaries will be evaluated by the scientific committee. Successful
candidates will be notified of acceptance on August 15, 2014. Participants
will be offered travel reimbursements according to COST rules and
limitations (i.e. reimbursement of flight/travel and a 100 Euro lodging and
sustenance fee per day of up to a maximum of three days).To register as a regular attendee, please go to:
http://collatex.net/researchsummit . Registration closes on September 15,
2014.
