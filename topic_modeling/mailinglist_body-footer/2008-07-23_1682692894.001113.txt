'Markup of the epigraphy and archaeology of Roman Libya'1,500 Greek and Latin inscriptions survive from Roman Cyrenaica (modern
Libya). A project to produce a digital publication of these texts is
currently in progress at Kingâ€™s College London, in association with
colleagues in Libya, Italy and the U.S.A. (http://ircyr.kcl.ac.uk/).
This paper discusses the issues surrounding the markup of these texts in
EpiDoc XML and the possibilities of associating archaeological data with
the epigraphic material.ALL WELCOMEThe seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk or
