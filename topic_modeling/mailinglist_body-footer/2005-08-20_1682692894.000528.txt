involved with technology for longer than, say, modern history or literature, =
or
philosophers, for the very same reason. Paradoxically, we have more than our
pair share of Luddites (meant in the most respectful way possible--in the sen=
se
of traditional philologists who believe that using the Thesaurus Linguae
Graecae database to look up a word, or the Perseus digitised Lewis and Short
dictionary to gloss a meaning, would weaken them, would cause them to lose
their essential mental powers and become no better than the students they sco=
rn
for doing so). These Luddites are not necessarily older generation scholars, =
by
any means: I know plenty of young scholars from Oxford or Harvard who cast
themselves in precisely that mould, partly to emulate their mentors, no doubt,
and partly to show off that they _do_ have these traditional skills. Much like
the peacock's impractical tail, I suppose, that shows the male bird is strong
enough to survive with an inconvenient physically burden.Ahem--random weekend digressions aside--I agree that it is very important that
graduate students be exposed to the technologies that help to shape the
development of their disciplines. Should this teaching be delivered by and as
part of the medieval/classics courses? Surely. Do medieval and classics
departments have the resources and experience to teach such courses? I'm not
sure. If not, are there enough good Humanities Computing centres to take on t=
he
responsibility? It is essential to be having this discussion, and I thank Dan
for opening it, and taking it to other fora.(Not so brief after all...)Best,
