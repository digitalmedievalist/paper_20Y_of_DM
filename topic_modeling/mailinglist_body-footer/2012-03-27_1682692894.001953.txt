Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThe Junicode font version 0.7.4, released today, adds the Gothic range 
in the regular face, based on the "Junius" Gothic typeface as used in 
Geo. Hickes, Thesaurus (1704), but with changes for accuracy and 
improved design. Also two new lookups, ss19 (Latin-to-Gothic 
transliteration) and ss20 (Gothic to Latin transliteration). Otherwise 
there are no significant changes from the previous version.Peter Baker
