Dear All,
My name is Nicol=C3=A1s L=C3=A1zaro, and I am a Professor and PhD in Philosop=
hy graduated from the National University of Rosario (UNR). Working at CONICE=
T-UNR Institute "Studium". I also teach the undergraduate course "Medieval an=
d Renaissance History of Philosophy Seminar" at the Catholic University of Sa=
nta Fe (UCSF).As a very personal hobby I am developing a Digital Humanities project. I have=
 started from absolute zero, with no-digital skills at all. In my free time I=
 have launched this initiative, which objectives are, between some others:* To take advantage of the technologies and data tools to communicate my rese=
arch, exploring new ways of doing it.
* To gain knowledge from data. Id est: transform all the info I can gather fr=
om using these tools, into knowledge through my own interpretationSome chapters of this project are dedicated to learning how to use markup lan=
guage in late medieval / Italian Renaissance / early modern texts. My PhD The=
sis was a comparative dissertation between two authors. I have done it "old s=
chool": flash cards, charts, etc. In other words: I want to transform my PhD =
Thesis research and conclusions from its analogic format into digital (=3D"th=
e side project"). This is just a first step.It is my own experience that there is a poor offer around here (South America=
) regarding DH and Philosophy. Researching on the Web and through Twitter I h=
ave found your center, offering training and resources to develop some skills=
. Of course I am interested in getting involved and I would like to be in tou=
ch with you and your colleagues, at least to learn from you.The other aim of my email is to invite you or anyone who (if) is interested o=
r curious, to visit and know this "side project" I just launched a few days a=
go on Twitter.  @_nicolazaro_
Till now I have learned HTML5 and CSS3 basics, bought a domain and wrote some=
 code. I am working developing this landing page, that will replace the one y=
ou can see at https://nicolaslazaro.com/So, again, I invite you to see someone with no-digital skills getting involve=
d with DH and see my progress, advise me, give me some suggestions or feedbac=
k.
I will deliver my progress there, and I will be really pleased to see you and=
 interact.Thank you very much for reading this mail and I am sorry for my English (as y=
ou can wish, I am far away from being a native speaker...).Kind regards,
Nicol=C3=A1s.-
Prof. Nicol=C3=A1s A. L=C3=A1zaro, PhD.
Doctor en Filosof=C3=ADa--===============6746070086840980013==
