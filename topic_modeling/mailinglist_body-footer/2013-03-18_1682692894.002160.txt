Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Peter,
I thank you very much for the extremely useful figures you have collected. I =
am an out-and-out supporter of digital editions, and yet I am afraid you unde=
restimate the "contacts" a book can have in a library or even in a bookstore.=
 I suppose that the figures of use of paper books, if we could count them, an=
d mainly the number of actual readers (not just "visits", that can come many =
times from the same user) would and will be bigger than the figures of equiva=
lent digital editions, but I have no evidence of that. So the only data we ca=
n correctly compare are the sold copies.
That said, we all have to do digital editions, whatever it may mean, and give=
n the anarchy that is distinctive of the web, no one can determine what a dig=
ital edition must be: we can just  propose methodological requirements for wh=
at we would accept to call *critical* digital editions and see which models b=
ecome successful or authoritative.
All the best,
Francesco Stella

  Subject: Re: [dm-l] New article on "Medievalists and the Scholarly DigitalE=
dition" -- who has actually been using these editions?
  Dear everyone
  there is a missing elephant in these discussions.  What evidence do we have=
 that these editions are being used? who is using them?
  Rather to my surprise, there seems remarkably little 'hard' data about exac=
tly how many people are using these editions.  So here is an attempt to provi=
de some real statistics on their use.
  1.  Web statistics for edition use.
  I have statistics dating back to last October (2012) for two substantial 's=
cholarly digital editions' (to use Patrick Sahle's convenient description) on=
line:=20
  a. Barbara Bordalejo's Origin of Species Variorum, http://darwin-online.org=
.uk/Variorum/
  Over six months, this has had 2995 unique visitors (nearly 500 a month, or =
around 16 a day), paying 3727 visits and looking at 15801 pages.  Maybe most =
interesting: 280 of those visits accounted for nearly half of all page views,=
 with 280 visits (about 1.5 a day) being longer than 10 minutes as the reader=
 appeared to look at page after page.  To put this in perspective: one suspec=
ts that more people have looked at this site, and used it intensively, than h=
ave used Peckham's printed Variorum in over fifty years.
  b. The database/virtual library of books (mostly) printed in or about Japan=
 before 1650, at http://laures.cc.sophia.ac.jp/laures/start/
  Over six months, this has had 1935 unique visitors (over 300 a month, or ar=
ound 10 a day), paying 3494 visits and looking at 27070 pages.  Maybe most in=
teresting: 441 of those visits accounted for well over half of all page views=
, with 441 visits (over two a day) being longer than 10 minutes as the reader=
 appeared to look at page after page.=20
  2.  Statistics for CD-ROM/DVD/internet sales.
  Here are the figures for digital editions, etc, sold by Scholarly Digital E=
ditions since 2001:

  (This will appear in an article in the next few months).  In addition to th=
ese figures:
  61 internet access licences have been sold to institutions for the Parliame=
nt Rolls, and some 10 individual online licences.
  Some points emerge from this.  First, these figures very strongly support D=
ot Porter's observation, that digital editions of historical materials have a=
chieved far more use than of literary materials.  Our runaway bestsellers, th=
e Parliament Rolls and Bayeux Tapestry, have done far better than our literar=
y materials.  The exception appears to be the Hengwrt Chaucer -- but that is,=
 we suspect, used much more to teach about manuscripts than to teach Chaucer.=
  The very few copies sold of the Commedia is sobering: this is probably our =
outstanding publication, in terms of sheer scholarly weight, and yet has sold=
 very few copies. =20
  Overall: the figures suggest that for literary works, there is much more ea=
gerness on the part of editors to make scholarly editions in digital form tha=
n there is of readers, to read them.  However, the success of our historical =
publications (and of the online publications noticed above) shows that withou=
t doubt, there is no reluctance to use digital materials online, or in CD-ROM=
/DVD-ROM, per se.  The problem with lack of enthusiasm for digital editions o=
f literary works is not, we have to conclude, because they are digital.
  well, make what you will of this

      Dear all,=20      Scholarly Digital Editing? I've just published three volumes on this to=
pic:=20
          http://www.i-d-e.de/schriften/s7-9-digitale-editionsformen      rough translation of titles:
          Digital Scholarly Editing
              Part I: The legacy of typography
              Part II: Survey, theory and methodology
              Part III: Notions of text and textual encoding      - the distinction between digitized and digital scholarly editions (DSE=
) is an important aspect in the definition of scholarly digital editions (SDE=
); see most recently http://prezi.com/mdt8efbe3o3a/patrick-sahle-what-is-a-sc=
holarly-digital-edition/ (hope to elaborate on that in a forthcoming article)=
; the main point here is, that there is a fundamental paradigm shift in think=
ing the scholarly edition in a typographic setting or in a digital informatio=
n environment      - should we make a distinction between digital scholarly editions (DSE)=
 and scholarly digital editions (SDE) ?
          - yes, because it describes two different processes or at least dif=
ferent accentuations
              - DSE emphasizes that we still follow the idea of scholarly edi=
ting but transform it to the digital world
              - SDE emphasizes the relation to other forms of digital publish=
ing which are augmented by the dimension of scholarly criticism
          - no, because it should lead to the same results: editions that are=
 truly scholarly AND truly digital      - is the edition its content or its presentation?
          - if the presentation is arbitrarily generated from underlying data=
, then it has some logic to say, that the data is the edition. On the other h=
and this would not fit well to the common notion of an "edition" as some form=
 of publication. I think, a SDE must comprise both: the data and some form of=
 publication of that data. What constitutes a particular edition is the defin=
ition of its subject together with a personal or institutional creatorship (o=
r responsibility). Edition of X by Y. The edition may then have different for=
ms of presentation (online, print, eBook, relaunched online version after som=
e time), which may also be "versions".      - do we really have a problem with the acceptance of digital editions?
          - first, I take up, what Andrew wrote...
              - "Compared to a printed book, they're miserable to read, since=
 they tend to be designed first for technical analysis, and any attention to =
typography is typically a very low priority"
                  - I'm not sure whether I'd agree on that. I find most SDEs =
quite readable. But yes, we're still in the incunabula age of digital texts. =
Good digital typography still has to evolve. Anyway, I'call a lot of the edit=
ions listed in my catalog "readable": http://digitale-edition.de/
              - "There's no guarantee in many cases that citations made from =
digital editions will be stable."
                  - but this is a known problem which we discuss for at least=
 ten years now. And the solutions are quite clear: PID/PURL-systems, fine gra=
nularity of adressable objects in editions, institutional committments for th=
e long-term support of SDE, versioning etc etc
              - "It's far easier to put a good printed edition together than =
a good digital edition, especially because of the lack of standard, user-frie=
ndly tools."
                  - true, but the underlying problem is that SDEs are far mor=
e complex than tradional edition (as regards content, methods, technical aspe=
cts) - and that's why generic tools are so hard to build              - "There is no standard way of presenting online critical editi=
ons (whereas most printed texts are published in series that follow a style g=
uide)."
                  - important point that the community has to address; but I =
see these publications series coming up; just some arbitrary examples:  http:=
//elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/ - http://www.sd-editions.com/index.html - http://www.=
hab.de/de/home/bibliothek/digitale-bibliothek-wdb/digitale-editionen.html - h=
ttp://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/              - "Delving into academic politics, publishers hate them and man=
y universities don't count digital projects toward tenure."
                  - traditional publishers will not solve the problems of SDEs
                  - academic interest groups are starting to deal with the pr=
oblem of credibility of digital work (the German Historians Union has just se=
t up a working group on digital scholarship with a subgroup on crediting digi=
tal work in tenure and promotion)
          - second: success on the reader's side can only be measured in comp=
arison to the success of traditional printed editions. In comparison to the f=
act that those often had an extremly low circulation, were bought nearly excl=
usively by libraries ....
          - third: success on the side of the editors. We had 6 summer school=
s on scholarly digital editing in the last 5 years (http://www.i-d-e.de/event=
s-des-ide). All have been overbooked. I see fewer and fewer newly starting ed=
ition projects that don't have a digital component or basis. There is some pr=
essure from the funding bodies, that new projects and new editions have to be=
 digital. But change takes some time.      Best, Patrick
