system. It will operate on XML files properly. It will index and 
concordance texts with a minimum of XML markup (a tag at the beginning 
of the file and one at the end will suffice!) and it will also handle  
texts with more markup than anything else (e.,g. ones -- like our 
version of the OE Corpus -- in which every word has an XML tag giving a 
lemma and a POS code for it). You can  save results from it as XML 
files, or you can develop your own web application to interact with it 
at a low level. We've tested it on lots of different languages, and on 
small or very large corpora -- the biggest so far being the Hungarian 
National Corpus, which contains about 600 million words of annotated 
texts....And it is an open source system.  See http://xaira.sf.net for more 
information.--===============4254871718104142583==--
