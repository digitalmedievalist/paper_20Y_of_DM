help. We at Croatian Center for Digital Humanities are working (among other)
on digital representation of Croatian medieval chronicles (in Latin and
Croatian) from 14th and 15th century.  What we need is simply examples of
similar projects in the world so that we can learn from them.  Any help in
pointing us to the right direction is most welcome and I thank you in
advance. P.S. Some of the project links on TEI web are dead so I am asking you
directly through this lists Sincerely, Daniel MondekarVice DirectorCenter for Digital HumanitiesZagrebCroatiawww.digitalna-humanistika.org
