Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Peter and others,Thank you for these helpful responses.I agree completely with your advice that one should seek out repositories and=
 generally try to get the data freely in the hands of as many as possible. Da=
niel's point about DOIs is also very useful.Having said that, these are advice about how to avoid extinction in the worst=
 case scenario, e.g. when no one is actively curating, revising, or hosting t=
he data and it is in danger of disappearing because in the short run there is=
 no one to care.I am curious about how to prepare for the best case scenario, e.g. a single s=
cholar or small group of scholars create data files which are received by the=
 scholarly community as of sufficient value to be crowd curated indefinitely.=
 While the fact that the data will be CC-by means that the crowd will be free=
 to do what it wants, from a  pragmatic perspective it seems like it would st=
ill be useful to have an editorial board of sorts Joel mentioned in his post =
for the following reasons:1. To offer scholarly peer review to the revisions to the data, in effect cre=
ating canonical revisions.
2. To curate guidelines and coordinate collaboration for this revision.
3. To own and administer the URL associated with the project (which is used f=
or minting URIs, for redirecting to content repositories, and to serve as the=
 single URL for finding the data).
4. To give some momentum to the project should interest wane for a period aft=
er the initial researchers have stopped intense work on the data.I am very much aware and even happy with the fact that in a certain sense the=
 work of this editorial board is non-binding since the data is open and peopl=
e will do what they want with the data. At the same time, I believe that scho=
larly peer review is valuable.So my question is, how do I structure this standing committee? Should it be b=
ased at a university, a publisher, through a scholarly society, as a formal n=
on-profit corporation, as an informal agreement, etc?In the past such multi-generation collaboration might have occurred through a=
 press (various dictionaries for example) or through a scholarly society (lon=
g running translation or publication series) but I am wondering about how thi=
s model occurs in the digital age.I would love to see examples from formal arrangements others have made if any.Thank you!David A. MichelsonAssistant Professor

Subject: How to make your data live forever (and maybe your project?)HI David
I think you are hitting upon a very sore point in the DH/editorial communitie=
s.  We have had editorial projects launched all over the place, with great en=
thusiasm and often, substantial funding.  Many now face exactly the problem y=
ou outline: what happens after the PI/institution move on?
So, here are three things you can do which will help immensely:
1.  Explicitly declare all your materials as Creative Commons Share-alike att=
ribution: that is, **without** the 'non-commercial' use restrictions so often=
 (and wrongly) imposed by many projects.
2.  Place the data, so licensed, on any open server.  The Oxford Text Archive=
 is, after so many years, still the best place I know to put your data.
That alone should be enough to make your data live forever.  And wonderfully,=
 these two options will cost you not a cent, and maybe just  a few hours of y=
our time to deal with the OTA deposit pack.Optionally, you could also:
3.  Place the data within an institutional repositiory.  This gives you the o=
ption to use the IR tools to construct an interface, and provide basic search=
 and other tools.  In my mind, this option has been scandalously underused by=
 DH projects, for reasons which might be the subject of another post.  But th=
is does provide the opportunity for you to present your project in a way that=
 will connect its metadata with the whole world of OASIS etc tools, and offer=
 a sustainable interface.  The University of Birmingham Research Archive give=
s some idea of how this might work: see (for example) the entries for the Min=
gana collection (eg http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/84/) and Codex Sinaiticus ( htt=
p://epapers.bham.ac.uk/1690/).There is another answer:
1.  Keep the 'non-commercial' licence restriction on your data.  You can ther=
eby claim that you are allowing all your fellow academics to use it freely, w=
hile (if you choose) not actually making it freely available outside your int=
erface.
2.  Create an elaborate and very attractive interface to your data
3.  Persuade your university, or someone, to set up a DH centre, with a minim=
um staff of a director and programmer, space and dedicated equipment (say, 10=
0K a year if you can swing this with part-time staff etc).  This DH centre wi=
ll then have the task of maintaining your data (which of course, only the cen=
tre has), interface and project.  This centre can then deal with all the issu=
es you raise in your post.
4.  Persuade your university, or someone, to support data, interface and proj=
ect, in perpetuityWell, good luck with that!Peter

Could you please point me to long running DH projects whose protocols for gov=

Given the concerns over sustainability inherent in DH, I am also interested i=
n advice on how to transition a project from the stage where a grant-funded P=
I is the leader in getting content online to where a volunteer editorial boar=
d (and institutional hosts) maintain a project longer term. Also, how do DH p=

 independent of any institution (like some non-profit scholarly journals or p=

Please suggest links to examples to follow from existing projects if you are =
aware of them.
