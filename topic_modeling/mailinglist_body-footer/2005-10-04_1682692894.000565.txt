progress (Hall's Chronicle, 1550--about 700,000 words of Hall's text 
plus quite a lot of notes.  Quite frankly, if this is ever to be put up 
on the web in my or anyone else's lifetime, I need to rely on tools like 
Google. I see that Google posts "Guidelines for Webmasters" at 
http://www.google.com/webmasters/guidelines.html  They seem very 
oriented toward those who run commercial sites.  Are these guidelines 
adequate for making the kind of material that medievalists create 
attractive to a search engine like Google?  Are there some that scholars 
would emphasize and others than Google doesn't post? BTW is it true that Google only index the top n% or K of a file?Cheers,
Al Magary
