New Life into Old Courses?
Using Digital Tools in Reading and Prose Composition ClassesIs it possible and desirable to use treebanking and translation
alignment tools in courses of prose composition and close reading? This
seminar will present an experiment of introducing such tools in Greek
courses at the University of Freiburg. The hypothesis is that digital
tools extend the ways we interact with texts both as readers and
writers, and enhance consciousness, thus promoting learning. We will
test this hypothesis and reflect upon the possibilities of combining
analogic reading with analysis through digital tools and the impact this
combination may have on our understanding either of an original text or
of a text we produce for exercise purposes.Recommended readings: http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2016-08sc.htmlThe seminar will be livestreamed at: https://youtu.be/dfUOpT4gyg4ALL WELCOMEValeria Vitale
