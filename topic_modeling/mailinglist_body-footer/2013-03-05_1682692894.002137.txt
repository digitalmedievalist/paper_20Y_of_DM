Subject: RE: [dm-l] TAN: Publishing screen shotsDear DanielGiven that you are taking screen shots, the optimal way to do this on Windows=
 would be using CTRL+ALT+prt sc which will capture the current window in focu=
s to the clipboard and then you can cut and paste this to an imaging program =
such as Photoshop, the full version of Acrobat which allows you to =E2=80=9Cc=
reate a PDF from the clipboard=E2=80=9D or something similar. If you have Goo=
gle Picasa3 running in background then it will pick up the fact you have capt=
ured a screenshot to the clipboard and will allow you to manipulate it. Mac h=
as its own equivalents and utilities for these sequences. See: http://guides.=
macrumors.com/Taking_Screenshots_in_Mac_OS_X  I would recommend against using=
 a digital camera to photograph a display because you will have an inevitable=
 drop in quality of the final image compared to a screen grab.However, the thing to appreciate is that screen resolution is very low compar=
ed to print resolution and depends on both the horizontal and vertical resolu=
tion as well as the screen size. For example a typical wide laptop screen wit=
h a resolution of 1600x900 would equate to only around 72dpi on a screen grab=
. You will find this website useful in terms of telling you what your effecti=
ve dpi is when you do a screen grab on your computer: http://members.ping.de/=
~sven/dpi.htmlIf your publisher is saying they need 300dpi TIFF for screen shots, then it m=
ay just be that they don't understand what you want to achieve. Howev=
er, it is certainly possible to achieve this by decreasing the physical size =
of the image. As one example, a 1600x900 pixel screen grab image off a 22=E2=
=80=9Dx12.5=E2=80=9D laptop display equates to ~72dpi. Change the image size =
to 300dpi in Photoshop (use constrain proportions and do not use resampling) =
and this gives you a 5=E2=80=9D x 3=E2=80=9D image. This might seem a bit wei=
rd at first but probably the best way to think about this is that you are fit=
ting more pixels into a smaller area which would probably suit an A5 (or USA =
equivalent) size page.Probably the best thing to do initially is just to do a screen grab, convert =
it to a TIFF or PDF using any one of the many utilities that exist to do this=
 and then email it to the publisher and see what they say. You'll pro=
bably find they also accept JPG. Most publishers do.Hope this helps.Best regardsTony Harris

Subject: [dm-l] TAN: Publishing screen shotsHi all,I have a tangential topic: what is normal practice regarding screen shots in =
print and PDF?I have an article coming out and the production manager wants 300 dpi TIFFs f=
or my images. But the images are for the most part screen shots and, since I'=
m talking /about/ navigation and representation issues in virtual environment=
s, I can't go with the second option they offered me:giving URLs rather than presenting that actual images in the text.I'm sure I've seen screenshots in both print and PDFs before. What is normal =
practice?-dan--Daniel Paul O'DonnellProfessor of EnglishUniversity of LethbridgeLethbridge AB T1K 3M4Canada+1 403 393-2539Digital Medievalist --  http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/Journal: http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/Journal Editors: editors _AT_ digitalmedievalist.orgNews: http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/news/Wiki: http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/wiki/Twitter: http://twitter.com/digitalmedievalFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=3D49320313760Discussion list: dm-l(a)uleth.ca<mailto:dm-l(a)uleth.ca>Change list options: http://listserv.uleth.ca/mailman/listinfo/dm-l--===============6825485831182328285==
