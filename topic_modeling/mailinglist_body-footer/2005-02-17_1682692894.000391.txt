I=C2=B4m not sure if this is the right forum for such a query, but I=C2=B4m s=
ure
you will know if anyone does!  I=C2=B4ve found lots of on-line resources with
illutrations and descriptions of manuscripts. I=C2=B4d like to find an example
which I could use to illustrate, for the same text,=20
1) the manuscript itself
2) a diplomatic transcription
3) a normalized transcription
and (if possible)=20
4) a translation.=20
The point is to illustrate the various possibilities
to students who may not have thought about
manuscripts.=20
It strikes me that this sort of information is more likely to be on a "teachi=
ng" website
(in paleography, perhaps?) than anywhere else. Any suggestions where I should
start looking would be greatly appreciated!
