Friday Afternoon =E2=80=93 http://bit.ly/CenteringDH-FridayAfternoonOver the past decade, the use of digital methods has exploded in the study of=
 art history and visual culture. As with other areas of the digital humanitie=
s, art historians and visual culture scholars have used a very wide range of =
approaches. Still, increasingly, one of the core areas that art history and v=
isual culture have particular focused on is the analysis of spatial problems =
through computational methods and digital visualization. This conference brin=
gs to the fore core contributions of art historians and visual culture schola=
rs to the spatial digital humanities. Looking at objects and environments at =
a wide variety of scales, panelists will ask: What spatial and temporal cultu=
ral problems can be addressed with digital methods? Conversely, speakers will=
 address how the art and visual culture extend and complicate developments wi=
thin the digital humanities.This conference is held in conjunction with the 10th anniversary of the found=
ing of the Wired! Lab for Digital Art History & Visual Culture here at Duke U=
niversity. The Wired! Lab is itself a center of major research involving the =
study of objects, buildings, and urban environments at a variety of different=
 scales and with diverse computational methods. We are pleased to host this d=
ialogue on how spatial problems in art history and visual culture contribute =
to important developments within the digital humanities.---
