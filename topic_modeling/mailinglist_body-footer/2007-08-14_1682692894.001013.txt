in=20
other answers you might receive), have you considered some of the corpus=20
linguistic analysis software out there?  It would involve having all the=20
sources, of course, in the corpus but then indicating that one text uses a=20
particular text more than another seems fairly straightforward.  However, as =with all such things having the texts with detailed descriptive markup would =
be=20
even more beneficial.  I can't think of anything which would do exactly what =
you=20
want out-of-the-box.-James--=20
