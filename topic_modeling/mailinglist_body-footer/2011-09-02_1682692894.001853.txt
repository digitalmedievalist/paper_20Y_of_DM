Interedition 8th Bootcamp: 7 October - 11 October 2011
-----------------------------------------------------== ABOUT INTEREDITION ==
Interedition (http://www.interedition.eu) is a COST (http://www.cost.eu)
funded Action whose objective is to further the interoperability of tools in
digital scholarship. Interedition is raising the awareness of the importance
of interoperability as a major driver for sustainability for tools and data
in the field of digital scholarship. This activity takes two forms: firstly,
meetings in which researchers in digital scholarship can network their
knowledge of tools and avenues towards their interoperability; secondly, the
development of proof-of-concept implementations of interoperable tools.
These proof-of-concept tools are the focus of Interedition's periodic
bootcamps, which offer the open source development community in the
humanities opportunities to meet, network, and exchange knowledge.== THE BOOTCAMP ==
Interedition is inviting all interested to participate in the upcoming
Development Bootcamp, which will take place from 7 October to 11 October
2011 at the Universität Würzburg, coinciding with the start of the
TEI-meeting (http://www.zde.uni-wuerzburg.de/tei_mm_2011/) which also takes
place there. We hope thus to offer a good occasion for members of both
groups to confer on the subject of interoperability. As special Think Tank
for this is foreseen on 12 October, for which seperate bursaried may be
acquired.The bootcamp and think tank are organized through the kind efforts of:- Fotis Jannidis (Universität Würzburg)
- Malte Rehbein (Universität Würzburg)
- Gregor Middell (Universität Würzburg)
- Susan Schrebman (Trinity College Dublin)== OBJECTIVES ==
The primary objective of the bootcamp is the development of prototypes for
interoperable 'microservice' tools for textual scholarship and digital
editions. Interedition's working group 3 has identified transcription and
annotation of physical textual sources one of the pivotal scholarly tasks
involved with creating digital editions. At the 2010 München bootcamp in
less than 5 minutes more than 18 transcription & annotation related tool
development projects were identified. Non of these is adhereing to any
machine to machine protocol or format for interchange. All results of high
quality scholarly work on transcribing and commenting within these data
silos are therefor locked in and hadrly (re)useable for further scholarly
processing and analysis.Interedition wants to inspire an open source development movement around
this problem of interoperabilty and invites anyone who can make a hands on
contribution to a prototype distributed reference implementation of an
interoperable model for text. We aim to have the participants returning to
their local projects with a shared idea on how to approach text resource
exchange, and GUI and back end tools to show for it. Suggested goals for the
bootcamp are both models and proof of concept implementations for the
following use cases:** Use Case 1 **
** Resource discovery & Highly granular text addressing/markup **
A text repository hosts a set of marked-up texts, possibly organized in
different subsets (collections). Clients access the repository via RESTful
protocols, particularly via the AtomPub protocol in order to get notified
about newly created or recently modified texts in the repository and/or
about certain layers of markup applied to them. The client could filter
those feeds based on the text collection or markup/annotation type of
interest. The Atom feeds' content is constructed dynamically based on
customized queries against the repositories' content and would thus augment
established standards for resource discovery that usually operate on the
level of curated metadata (e.g. OAI-PMH). Automatized dissemination of
transcribed texts in a decentralized, loosely coupled network of
repositories is thus facilitated in a manner comparable to the way in which
the blogosphere functions.** Use Case 2 **
** Text source exchange **
Use case: Texts can be replicated between repository installations and/or
other datastores. The exchange includes the textual content as well as any
chosen set of markup/ annotation layers associated with the text. Markup is
allowed to overlap arbitrarily in the repositories own model while lossless
transformation of text and markup information into XML-based encodings
provides for the integration with existing tool chains. Interoperability and
data interchange is thus facilitated.** Use Case 3 **
** Transcription & Annotation workflow **
Texts can be marked-up with several independent annotation layers such that
a collaborative transcription and annotation workflow becomes feasible. For
example an editor could start by transcribing a text with a minimal set of
markup applied. A tool for language recognition listens for new texts in the
repository and as soon as the editor submit the transcript, the tool adds
annotations to it identifying the language(s) present in the transcript.
Then a language-specific POS tagger, listening for repository events of
added language annotations processes the transcript further by adding
part-of-speech tagging. Later on automatic name entity recognition might be
applied to the tagged transcript and finally another editor is notified (via
an Atom feed or via e-mail), that the automatically tagged transcripts is
ready to be reviewed.FEEL CHALLENGED?
Come and code!BURSARIES
COST Action IS0704 'Interedition' is offering bursaries to early stage
researchers (< Ph.D. + 10 years) and developers that want to join the
bootcamp. The bursaries will consist of an 100 Euro per diem allowance and
will cover travel expenses fully (limitations apply).HOW TO APPLY
If you are interested in participating in the bootcamp, please send an
email to joris.van.zundert-AT-huygens.knaw.nl by **25 September
2011**. You don't need an intricate motivation, but please state your
affiliation, and add a very short (certainly not more than 200 words)
description of your current or related development work in digital
humanities. If you partook in an earlier Interedition bootcamp, you may
refer to the motiviation you provided at the time. Please note that if you
do join the bootcamp, some formal paperwork will be necessary to get you the
bursary - but until now all
participants passed that test with flying colors.PROGRAM
