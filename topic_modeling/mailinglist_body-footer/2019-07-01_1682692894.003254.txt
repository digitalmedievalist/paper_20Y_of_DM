Base de Français Médiéval 
http://txm.bfm-corpus.org/?command=documentation&path=/BFM2019.The graphical design of the BFM-TXM web portal has been entirely revised 
and improved at this occasion.The Terms of use have been simplified and all the texts are now 
available under an open licence Etalab 
(https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/licence-ouverte-open-licence).The BFM2019 corpus includes some fifteen new texts and amounts 
approximately 4,700,000 words. All the texts are formatted according to 
the TEI guidelines (including the instances of directed speech), 
automatically pos-tagged and lemmatized. The POS tags are manually 
verified in 4 new texts (38 total, approximately 1,000,000 words), and 
the lemmatization is verified and disambiguated in 18 texts 
(approximately 400,000 words).The corpus includes three new original editions:
- /La Vie de saint Alexis/, ed. T. Rainsford et C. Marchello-Nizia,
- /L’image du monde/ by Gossouin, prose version, ed N. Kanaoka,
- /Les quinze joies de mariage/, ed. N. Kanaoka on the basis of the 
printed edition prepared by M. Guéret-Laferté, S. Louis and C. Mira, 
Rouen, Presses universitaires de Rouen et du Havre, 2009.Best regards,The BFM Team
