Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI'm thinking about working on a project a year or two from now that 
involves a ms facsimile, edition, etc., but in the meantime I would like to 
know what issues to think about before I get started such as what factors 
help determine what framework to set up or what software to use. I don't 
want to do a whole bunch of work on something and then discover that I made 
less than favorable decisions and have to redo a bunch of tedious work.So, I am looking forward very much to learning from the primer and from 
lurking on this list about important concerns and solutions. I suspect I 
will have much better questions later in the process.Carol Braun Pasternack
