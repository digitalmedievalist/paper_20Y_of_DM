one of the UG modules we run here at CCH is an Introduction to Digital 
Humanities
http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/humanities/depts/cch/ug/modules/av1003/
(follow the link for teaching materials for what we actually cover)Many would like to see this or something similar rolled out as a core 
component of all UG Humanities degree programmes.For a programme that integrates DH stuff in a wider humanities programme 
see
the Informatica Umanistica course at Pisa
