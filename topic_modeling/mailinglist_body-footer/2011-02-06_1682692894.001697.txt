Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHi all,I have a new research assistant who is going to be helping us at the DM 
journal. She's a Mac user, and to get her set up, I'd appreciate any 
advice this list has for software for the following:1) SVN client (we use subversion for our journal back end and she'll 
need access; I'm assuming the Mac Version of Oxygen comes with the same 
SVN client the other versions do, but it might be nice to have a 
separate svn client as well--something like turtleSVN for Windows.2) Unicode navigator--is there a standard code point navigator for Mac? 
Almost right away we're going to have her putting in some greek and 
mathematical symbols in an article: is there a utility for browsing and 
search code points?-dan
