might be interested in this work. I'll be presenting a paper on this at
Kalamazoo (session 330), so if you take issue with our decisions you can
write me on- or off-list, or wait until after my talk  :)***Hi Roberto,I'm interested in seeing if the TEI extensions we developed for the
Electronic Boethius project would suit the needs you have for the Digital
Vercelli Book. The documentation is available at http://rch01.rch.uky.edu/~ept/TEI-cotlib/This site documents how I went about mapping to old (non-TEI) cotlib DTD
into a "master" TEI DTD, and then modified this single DTD into several
smaller "working" DTDs (for the EPT's overlapping markup support)."DTD View" refers to the organization of the working DTDs themselves;
"Editor's View" refers to the organization of the elements within the
context of the EPT.I'm giving a paper on these extensions at Kzoo, in fact, and it would be
nice to know ahead of time how acceptable these extensions might be to other
projects (since they will be released as part of the EPT).Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.Thanks,
Dot

Subject: [dm-l] Help in customizing the TEI DTDHi all,
after much dealying I finally accepted the idea that I will need to use
a customized version of the TEI DTD for my project(s): I read the
guidelines, but would surely appreciate any further help, can anybody
point me to tutorials, examples etc. on the web? Has anybody had any
luck in using Roma? I couldn't save my modifications as a DTD, is it
going to remain a schema-only tool?Thanks in advance.Ciao
