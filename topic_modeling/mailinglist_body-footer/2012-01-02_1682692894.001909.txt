are used in bioinformatics. Your best help may come from such tools as
Philomine, the ARTFL sequence alignment program, which has been used very
successfully to trace the sources of Diderot's Encyclopedie.The ARTFL people are very helpful. Closer to home, there is the e-aqua
group in Leipzig. Marco BÃ¼chler, a computer scientist there, has worked a
lot on quotation tracking in Latin texts.There isn't, to my knowledge, a user-friendly tool that lets you do this
stuff "out of the box." But it's a pretty well-understood problem with a
lot of solutions. MMOn 1/2/12 10:35 AM, "Christian Schwaderer"
