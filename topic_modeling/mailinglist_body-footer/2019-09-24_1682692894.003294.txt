Spinhuis, Room 2.18Oudezijds Achterburgwal 185, AmsterdamAt present, a wealth of historical documents recording public domain
content is stored in the =E2=80=98dark-archives' of memory institutio=
ns to which
members of the public are granted limited access. The advent of
digitization has the potential to make the content recorded upon these
documents easily and speedily accessible to users across the globe in the
form of digital images. Thus, digitization has been hailed as a =E2=80=98digi=
tal
renaissance' in which the =E2=80=98forgotten-knowledge' recor=
ded upon these
documents can be unfettered from their tangible carriers and widely
circulated to be freely used in the enrichment of social, cultural and
scientific discourse. Digitization has particular significance for scholars
who are now able access and re-use these images in scientific research.
However, in many instances such re-use is restricted through copyright
claims made by the memory institutions and private sector entities who
invest in the digitization process. But can a digital image of a public
domain work produced through a mass-digitization process qualify for
copyright protection?This presentation analyzes the legitimacy of copyright claims that are made
in respect of digital images of documents recording public domain content
and explores the space available to researchers and scholars to re-use
these images for non-commercial purposes. It also attempts to identify
means by which the researcher community may contribute to policy-making in
this area with the objective of achieving greater freedom in using digital
images of public domain documents for research purposes.*For further information and to register, contact Evina Steinova
