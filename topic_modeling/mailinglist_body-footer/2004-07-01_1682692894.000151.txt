record the original format in xml.  Since we will always keep a copy 
of the original deposit, we want to preserve the intent behind the 
markup, not necessarily the markup choices itself.  So yes, we are 
concerned with conversion to more flexible markup schemes (though 
just having stuff all in the _same_ format would be nice whatever 
that format was).
So with COCOA converting:
<SN Scene 2>
<SSD Enter Martin Holmes>
<Q Martin>No markup is objective or transparent
<Q James>Can't disagree with that!

<sp><speaker>Martin</speaker><l>No markup is objective or

<sp><speaker>James</speaker><l>Can't disagree with that!</l></sp>
...
</div>This is a fairly neutral change as far as the content goes and I
can't seem much data loss in it.  Although it is (I think) an 
accurate reflection of the intention of the original markup, it 
isn't in any way an XMl version of the COCOA markup.Part of the problem in conversion comes in identifying the 
intent behind the original markup in a field that I don't 
understand.  (This is good news for the medieval resources 
we hold, since I generally understand that field... but I 
wouldn't trust myself as much with say Buddhist texts.)
The only solution I can think of for that is to go ahead 
and do the conversion, and show the before and after versions 
to a specialist in that area.  -James---
