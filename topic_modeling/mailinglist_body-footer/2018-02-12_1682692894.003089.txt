the work of the community. Although the working language of DH Awards is
English, nominations may be for any resource in any language. Awards are
not specific to geography, language, conference, organization or field of
humanities. There is no financial prize associated with these community
awards. There were many nominations and the international nominations
committee (http://dhawards.org/dhawards2017/committee/) reviewed each
nomination. Weâ€™re sorry if your nomination was not included, or changed
category, all decisions are final once voting opens. Please see
