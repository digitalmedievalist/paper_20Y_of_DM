Dear all,
after a long period of testing and bug-fixing today we release EVT 3
alpha! This is the very first version after switching from AngularJS to
Angular as a development framework: the basic features are already there
(support for diplomatic and critical editions, page-level image-text
linking, support for named entities), but they are still to be completed
(e.g., the critical edition apparatus frame has not yet been
implemented) and some basic features such as a search engine are missing
as well. Please let us know what you think of this version, your
feedback will help us in developing a stable and feature complete
version 1.0.Full announce available at
