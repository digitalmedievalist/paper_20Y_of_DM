Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI use subscriptions as an informal topic popularity meter: most postings
on dm-l result in an average of 5 new subscriptions and 3
unsubscriptions. Postings on XSLT result in 5 unsubscriptions and 3
subscriptions ;). Interestingly, posting the unicode website resulted in
no loss and some gain. Perhaps a gauge of usefulness?-dan
