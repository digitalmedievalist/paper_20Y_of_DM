rint edition of the Canterbury Tales. I often teach broad literature courses =
and try to include Chaucer, but I don't like requiring students to purchase a=
 whole book just for a couple tales. I've started to make my own e-book (.mob=
i, .epub) and print-ready (.pdf) files, with my own notes and introductions, =
so my students have access to the same edition in whatever format works best =
for them. I'm planning to put both the files and the source (TEI P5 XML and L=
aTeX) online, but I was wondering if others would find an expanded Chaucer pr=
oject useful. If working on or using an open-access and open-source e-book an=
d print-ready version of the Canterbury Tales is of interest, please email me=
 at vaughnrs(a)email.unc.edu.Vaughn Stewart
