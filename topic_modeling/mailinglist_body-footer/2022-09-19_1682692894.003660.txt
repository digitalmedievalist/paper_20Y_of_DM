Dear Karen, dear all,as for a lemmatised word list and a concordance stricto sensu, Dutripon's con=
cordance may still be convenient - as it is lemmatised and digitized (8th edi=
tion, 1880: https://books.google.fr/books?id=3D9fbZNP1p_P4C; higher resolutio=
n, but 1st ed. 1838 at https://archive.org/details/concordantiaebib00dutr/).However, I would now recommend using the wonderful digital scholarly edition =
of the Bible and glossa ordinaria and several other systematic commentaries, =
published by my colleague and friend Martin Morard at the following url: http=
s://gloss-e.irht.cnrs.fr:It contains:- the full text of the Latin bible of the late Middle age, based on a revised=
 version of the 1481 edition, corrected with hitherto unpublished material, a=
nd linked to additional editions (some still being in progress):- the glossa ordinaria (as published in Strasbourg in 1481, covering 2415 pag=
es)- the Glossa media in Psalmos et epistolas Pauli by Gilbertus Porreta (Gilber=
t de la Porr=C3=A9e, c. 1120-1140)- the Glossa magno in Psalmos et epistolas Pauli by Petrus Lombardus (1160)- Postillae super totam bibliam of Hugo of Sancto Charo (c. 1230-1240)- Catena aurea super quattuor Evangelia of Thomas Aquinas (1262-1272)The whole is supplemented by a repertory of 11500 manuscript parts (ca. 6000 =
different shelfmarks) containing parts of the glossed bible.Therefore, if one wishes to know if a word is in the text of the Latin bible =
as it was read in the middle ages or if it has been used in connection with t=
he bible or in which branch of the stemma, this is most probably the place to=
 start.Best regards,Dominique StutzmannLe 13/09/2022 =C3=A0 01:05, Kevin Roddy a =C3=A9crit :

sourceforge.net/The Christian section of the Bible follows the Vetus Latina in a number of re=
spects, since it was widely available before Jerome translated the Jewish sec=
tion, so that should not be an insurmountable  problem for simple searches.Blessings,Kevin Roddy

g(a)uleth.ca>.hi digital medievalists!I have lurked on your site for many years with pleasure.Now I have had a chat with a friend who is doing a translation of a Merovingi=
an saint's life and who wonders if there is any such thing in existence as a =
digital Biblical concordance. This would allow the user to compare their elec=
tronic text of interest with the text of the Vulgate (or vetus Latina.. why n=
ot) and have returned a list of words in their text which are in the Latin Bi=
ble, or CONVERSELY which are NOT in the Latin Bible.It seems that such a useful tool
 should already exist and I thought I might ask you all if you know of this b=
eing in existence or of an expert to consult with.THANK you in advance for any help you might be able to give me!
Karen Corsano
It seems to me that such  a useful tool
