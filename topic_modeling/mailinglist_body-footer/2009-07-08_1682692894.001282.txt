Today we are launching the first phase of the Virtual Manuscript Room, =20
with full sets of digital images for 71 manuscripts from the Mingana =20
collection (some 13000 images).  You can find the site at http://www.vmr.bham=
.ac.uk=20
.  Among other things, the site has images of one of the oldest copies =20
of the Qur'an in existence, Mingana Islamic Arabic 1572, recently =20
dated as possibly 7th century.The site has some interesting features.  Firstly, it is completely =20
integrated with the university's institutional repository: see http://epapers=
.bham.ac.uk/=20
  (the manuscripts are at http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/view/series/Mingana.html)=
=20
.  This gives them a presence in the online catalogues, which means =20
they can be found by Google,and also provides a secure long-term =20
maintenance strategy.  Secondly, we developed a new image viewer, =20
using the 'Open Layers' software.  This is not finished yet, but =20
already offers some nice developments: it does not use Flash (it is =20
entirely javascript based); the viewer resizes horizontally as the =20
window resizes; it has a 'carousel' which allows you to browse =20
thumbnails of all the manuscript pages within the viewer.  Finally, =20
following my well-known philosophy, it is low-cost: the imaging cost =20
around 50 pence a page; the whole cost of the site was a few pounds a =20
page.  Note that the imaging was done a few years ago and lacks some =20
things (rulers, colour bars) which we should now include.Enjoy!
all the best
