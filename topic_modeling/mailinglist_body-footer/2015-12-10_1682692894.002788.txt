For programme and booking, see: http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/26264In recent years, there has been a significant shift in scholarly culture and =
funding

e potential
for new forms of production, presentation and access that the digital promise=
s. And it
involves a reassessment of the conventions that have determined editorial pra=
ctice in
the age of print. This conference gathers together leading figures in the fie=
ld to

lenges
and limits. How should we place ourselves relative to fundamental issues of a=
uthority/openness,
durability/fluidity? Can we establish a set of ideal types for digital editor=

or would its optimal strengths rather lie in more hybrid forms, including a p=
roductive
mode of cohabitation with the print formats that it appears to want to supers=
ede?***********************************
