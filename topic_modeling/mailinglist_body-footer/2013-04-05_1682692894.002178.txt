Latinists. Out of the flotsam of an old research project that will never
get finished, I've set up a twitter feed that will give you a daily versus
differentialis of the sort associated with Serlo de Wilton, distinguishing
homonyms with short or long penultimate vowels, like this:Est uitrum saphĭrum, pro gemma dico saphīrum.The feed can be followed at https://twitter.com/versdiff , and the verses
also get posted to a Facebook page at
https://www.facebook.com/VersusDifferentiales and to a Wordpress blog at
http://versdiff.wallandbinkley.com/ where there's some background
information and a bit of scholarly apparatus.Peter
