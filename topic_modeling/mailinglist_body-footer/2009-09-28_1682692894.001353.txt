data mining in medieval studies, especially for authorship attribution  
and scribal identification. If you use them then which systems do you  
use? How do you verify the results? Do you trust the system to work  
and not simply to reproduce your own views? If you don't use these  
systems then why not? I'm thinking of a recent article in LLC 23  
(2008) by Sculley and Pasanek which seems to me to raise some  
important questions about the validity of data mining, but I'm also  
asking as a designer myself. If I'm producing software for scribal  
identification or authorship attribution, what can I do (if anything)  
that will convince you to use and trust my system?Peter--
