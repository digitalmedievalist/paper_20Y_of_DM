useful (please let me know if you do... or don't), but here goes:A common problem in text encoding is locating the correct codes for
"unusual letters". There are various utilities for doing this in
windows, mac, and Linux. But here is a useful web-based utility.You can
use it to look up character names and find their code point (though you
do have to be fairly precise), and it will produce the correct number in
hex and decimal formats. It will also tell you everything you ever
wanted to know about characters required for encoding Estonian.http://www.eki.ee/letter/See also the Digital Medievalist Wiki entry for character encoding

added information about this site).-dan--===============2116005833411691267==--
