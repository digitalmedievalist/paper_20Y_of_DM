t may be of interest to folks on this list as well (some of whom, I expect, w=
ill know more than me - I haven't studied medieval music since college). His =
original query concerned including the Medieval Encoding Initiative (MEI, htt=
p://dl.lib.virginia.edu/bin/dtd/mei/) as a module in the TEI.
********************
James (and list),There are at least two other prospective XML schemas for encoding music - Mus=
ic Markup Language (http://www.musicmarkup.info/) and MusicXML (http://www.mu=
sicxml.org/xml.html). I can't speak to the technical pros and cons of includi=
ng music markup as a part of TEI. I do think that it is something to consider=
, especially for, as you say, liturgical manuscripts (or other early manuscri=
pts that include musical notation).Having looked briefly at all three of these markup schemas, though, it appear=
s that all are designed specifically for modern Western musical notation - no=
tes of determined length on a standard staff. This would be fine for encoding=
 something like a 18th century hymnal, but less useful for 13th or 14th centu=
ry notation (which might be on a staff, but rhythm is not always clear), and =
not useful at all for the earliest notation (basically squiggles written over=
 the lyrics). It would be great to be able to describe these sorts of early n=
otation beyond simply noting that they're there, but it doesn't appear that t=
hese schemas are designed with early notation in mind (at least not publicall=
y, yet).Does anyone on the list know more? Is anyone interested in pursuing some sort=
 of notation extension/module to TEI?Dot***************************************
