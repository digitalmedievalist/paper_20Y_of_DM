University of Lethbridge gives us to run the DM website and wiki which
is stopping the machine from booting cleanly.  Someone at ULeth is
looking into it for us and service will be resumed as soon as
possible.  This does not affect the mailing list itself, but just the
website, wiki, journal, etc.My apologies for the interruption, I'll email again when there is any news.Dr James Cummings
Director, Digital Medievalist
