*Scholarship in Software, Software as Scholarship: From Genesis to Peer
Review**‘Expressions’, 29 January 2015: Workshop on Software-based Scholarship*
*Organizer: Digital Humanities, Universität Bern*Computation and software analysis have entered nearly every imaginable
field of scholarship in the last decades, in a variety of forms from
digital publication of results to computational modelling embedded in
experimental work. In each of these digital outputs – be it an interactive
publication with mapping of relevant geo-referenced data, or perhaps a
statistical program for the categorization of millions of books according
to their literary genre – there is some manifestation directly in the
computer code of the scholarly thought that underlies the project, of the
intellectual argument around which the outcome is based.The fact that scholarly software includes scholarly content is reasonably
well-accepted. What remains controversial is the attempt at identification,
in any particular instance, of what scholarly contribution has been made by
a piece of software. Its makers tend to express the scholarship in writing
separate from the software itself, if they even make explicit at all the
scholarly reasoning that went into the code; its reviewers and users tend
either to treat the software as a ‘black box’, opaque to informed scrutiny
and therefore to be looked on with grave suspicion, or to deny that this
particular software has any scholarship inherent to the source code. Given
that our mechanisms for identifying and evaluating the scholarship within
computer code are nearly nonexistent, we must ask: how do intellectual
arguments — how does scholarship — come to be expressed in the software of
digital humanities? How does this scholarship, so evident in theory but so
elusive in practice, fit into the scientific process of advancement of
knowledge?*‘Evaluation’, 30 January 2015: Round table on Peer Review for Digital
Scholarly Work*
*Organizer: Infoclio.ch*Related to the question of the expression of scholarship in software, and
in other forms of digital publication as well, is the question of how to
evaluate it. This topic will be the focus of a half-day roundtable, Peer
Review for Digital Scholarly Work, to be held on 30 January 2015. Digital
scholarly works such as Digital Editions, Digital Libraries, Digital
Exhibitions, Data Visualization, Geographical Information Systems and the
like are increasingly frequent in the Humanities, as main or secondary
output of research projects; the question of how best to evaluate them
takes on ever greater importance. At the moment, researchers doing digital
scholarly work are usually unable to obtain academic credit for their
work—in order to obtain scholarly recognition, they must additionally
publish a “normal” article in a print-based journal about their digital
work.As universities and national research funding agencies across the world
move toward encouraging more digital scholarship in the humanities, there
is an urgent need to discuss the criteria and benchmarks that should be in
place for evaluating digital scholarly work. We welcome contributions about
existing initiatives in this domain as well as more theoretical
contributions that treat the topic of peer review of digital scholarly work.--===============9174472955935981165==
