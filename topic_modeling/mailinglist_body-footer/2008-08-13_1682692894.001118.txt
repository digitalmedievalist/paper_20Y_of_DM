LondonIoannis Doukas (KCL)Towards a digital publication for the Homeric Catalogue of ShipsALL WELCOMEIn this paper we shall explore the possibilities opened in the digital
scholarship of Ancient Greek literature. We shall focus on the Homeric
Catalogue of Ships (Il. 2.484-759), as it is a text that calls for a
series of different scholarly approaches, and try to identify and
present the use of the appropriate digital tools to accomplish these
approaches.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk or
