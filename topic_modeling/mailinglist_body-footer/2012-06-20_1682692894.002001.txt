traditions or in the Oriental as well? I run a project on Syriac=20
monastic anthologies that aims, firstly, to describe all extant Syriac=20
monastic anthologies that were written from the 6th c. onwards (in total
 ca. 130 mss) and, secondly, to study a history of the formation and=20
development of the anthologies as well as peculiarities of the=20
circulation of monastic literature within them.Your can find a summary here:http://uni-marburg.academia.edu/GrigoryKessel/BlogYours sincerely

Date: Wednesday, June 20, 2012, 11:26 AMDear digital medieval colleagues:I am new to this list and would like to introduce the project I am currently =
working on:
I try to document the manuscript transmission of late antique and early medie=
val monastic texts. I especially focus on monastic rules and on understudied =
texts with a wide dissemination.
As a side product I collected links to all catalogues of medieval manuscripts=
 that are online or available on archive org - which turned out to be a rathe=
r useful tool. I am also collecting links to ongoing digital manuscript proje=
cts.
Especially for these pages I would be very happy to get some input from you.
Here are the links:
