Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHi all,For the duration of the balloting, I have changed the default behaviour
of the list: if you wish to reply to a message on dm-l, you will need to
enter dm-l(a)uleth.ca manually. Otherwise, your email will go only to the
poster of the message to which you are replying.I am changing it this way to avoid accidental postings of ballots. After
the election is over, the list behaviour will return to normal.-dan
