MGH online.As this is most probably my first mail to this list, allow me to
introduce myself: My name is Clemens Radl and I am working at the MGH in
Munich and am responsible for the digital MGH online (dMGH
<http://www.dmgh.de>).Right now I don't have the time to go into a lot of details. So this is
not a formal announcement of our project. I just wanted to answer some
of the points brought up by you.On Thu, Mar 16, 2006 at 01:27:23PM -0700, Daniel O'Donnell wrote:

good as I wish it were. But this is only a preliminary presentation
within a framework that was *not* specifically designed for the dMGH.
But we wanted to provide access to the scanned images as soon as
possible.The volumes have been scanned with 600 dpi and theses high quality
images will be used for OCR. In fact we have already OCR'ed all of the
Diplomata volumes and right now we are working at the Epistolae. And we
are making good progress.The software which will allow full text searches is in the final stages
of preparation. At least a prototype will be made available soon (I'll
refrain from mentioning a specific date, though).In fact, we are not going to do any proofreading. The images will always
be the main source of information. In the background you can do full
text searches and the results will be presented in the images with
highlighting (roughly comparable to Google Print).> On Thu, 2006-16-03 at 16:46 -0330, Bill Schipper wrote:

year boundary, i. e. new volumes will only appear on our web site five
years after publication ("moving wall"). But it's true that the
overwhelming majority of our printed editions are available online.Unfortunately, we right now do not have an English translation of our
web page, yet. Maybe I'll get to enter some information about the
project, our background and our schedule into the dm-l wiki these days
