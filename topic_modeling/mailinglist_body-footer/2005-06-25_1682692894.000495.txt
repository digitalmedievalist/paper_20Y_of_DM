indeed, are a founding goal of the whole DM project. Tools development
and discipline-wide cooperation requires that those contributing to the
development of the tools, techniques, or methods be rewarded in a
currency the rest of the humanities understands. A major goal of our
journal is to provide a clearly peer-reviewed outlet for reporting and
disseminating this kind of work. And we name accepting referees on the
article page as a way of exploiting the one real resource we have: the
willingness of top people in the various disciplines to devote time to
reading and criticising submissions. Our hope is that one will be able
to take DM articles (and ultimately monographs/editions) and show them
to a dean and/or hiring or promotion committee and have the real work
that goes into this kind of work recognised.Another project I am working on with a couple members of the executive
involves wikis and "commons" type exchanges, which don't work IMO in
their purest form for professional scholars because there is no reward
built in.I suppose this is a good opportunity to remind members a) that we are always eager to read contributions on digital tools,
techniques, methods (as well as theory or less practically focussed
work) for DM. And if you know of somebody doing something interesting
(even if it isn't medieval), encourage them to submit. Our rule is that
the work should be of interest to digitally active medievalists: not
that it need involve directly work by medievalists.b) that our wiki is available for (non-refereed) accounts of projects,
tools, conferences, and the like.-d
