Hey all,=20I'd like to point to us toward what someone in biblical studies has done: htt=
p://biblioblog.net/=20The site is mostly oriented toward blogs, hence the name, (btw, not enough of=
 you have good blogs out there.  Neither do I.) but if y ou scroll down the l=
eft menu you'll also note a "Lists/Discussions" heading that does post some m=
essages from email lists in the field.  I note though that at least the ones =
for today are all from yahoo groups email lists rather than university based =
lists, so that might present a problem in setting up the system.  But since I=
 have faith in medievalists and our use of technology I believe we could find=
 a way to adapt this to Dan's proposal.Larry Swain>=20
> Hi all,
> I have a question I'd like to run before the list:
>=20
> This morning I threw out the idea of setting up a humanities computing
> digest: that is to say a list that digests the traffic on important Hum
> Comp lists once a day but otherwise carries no traffic.
>=20
> Talking about it later with somebody, they suggested to me that 1 digest
> message each day would not be an unreasonable burden on a list like DM.
>=20
> Is this something people would appreciate? What I'm thinking is a list
> that simply subscribes to digital classicist, humanist, the junicode
> list, and I don't know what else, and is configured to send out a single
> digest message per day. If we subscribed dm-l to it as well, we would
> all receive this one message every day.
>=20
> If the goal was to add a digesting feature to dm-l, I would set the dm-l
> subscription to "reject postings" so that our postings would not be
> duplicated in the digest, and set the other lists to "nomail" so they
> wouldn't receive it. Since many of us are subscribers to several of
> these lists, there would be some duplication in individual mail boxes.
>=20
> The other option is to set up a separate digest and leave it at that.
>=20
> Suggestions/ideas?
