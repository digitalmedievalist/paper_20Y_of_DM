<http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/lectures/ljs_symposium.html> Lawrence
J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age. This
year's symposium will be on the theme of music in medieval and early modern
manuscripts.  We will explore a range of issues relating to music's
materiality in the late medieval period, especially as it pertains to the
manuscript source. We will bring together scholars and performers who will
examine the ways the written text of music, especially in the unit of the
codex, can be expressive as well  as prescriptive; the multiple functions of
music's most important technology - its notation; and finally, the role that
modern digital technology can facilitate the study of manuscripts today.The symposium begins Friday evening at the Free Library of Philadelphia with
a lecture and performance by the award-winning early music duo
<http://asteriamusica.com/premier.html> Asteria.  On Saturday at the
University of Pennsylvania, seven speakers will present papers on various
topics relating to the history of music manuscripts and notation. The
symposium will conclude with a roundtable to discuss issues related to the
digitization of music manuscripts and related documents and the role of the
digital humanities in medieval musicology.Special exhibitions of music manuscripts will be on view at both
institutions.Participants include:Jane Alden, Wesleyan UniversityJulia Craig-McFeeley,  <http://www.diamm.ac.uk/> Digital Image Archive of
