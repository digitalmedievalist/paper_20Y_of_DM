Call for Papers
International Conference =E2=80=9CThe Medieval Literary Canon in the Digital =
Age=E2=80=9D
Ghent University, 17=E2=80=9318 September 2018We invite submission of abstracts for the international conference =E2=80=9CT=
he Medieval Literary Canon in the Digital Age,=E2=80=9D to be held at Ghent U=
niversity from 17-18 September 2018.An often repeated promise of the digital humanities, in the wake of the =E2=
=80=9Ccomputational turn,=E2=80=9D is that the wide availability and accessib=
ility of historical texts would enable scholars to breach the restrictions of=
 a literary canon. The present international conference wishes to explore how=
 exactly the digital humanities can provide such insights for medieval studie=
s, in which such a promise raises critical questions.(1) In spite of the computational turn, much of the digital scholarship for t=
he Middle Ages still seems to hinge on well-conserved and therefore well-know=
n theological and literary authorities, whose texts have been reproduced cont=
inuously in subsequent editions and translations. To what extent does today=
's computational research manage to escape the straitjacket of the tr=
aditional canon?(2) Considering that in the past decades, medieval scholars have become incre=
asingly sensitive to the materiality of textual transmission in the Middle Ag=
es, the virtual, normative and reductive character of a digital environment a=
re not always compatible to their research interests.As the emancipation of the digital humanities from their merely supportive ro=
le is proclaimed increasingly, and as the tools for digital medieval studies =
proliferate (e.g. digital scholarly editing, computational stylistics, digita=
l palaeography, digital stemmatology, ...), this conference welcomes papers =
=E2=80=94based on either case studies or broader research questions=E2=80=94 =
that both problematize the specialized character of medieval literary product=
ion and demonstrate the potential for computational criticism to =E2=80=9Cbre=
ach=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cwiden=E2=80=9D the medieval canon through digital to=
ols.Full details on the topic and discussion of the conference are available on t=
he conference website http://www.mcda.ugent.be=E2=80=8B.The conference, to which we will accept 8 scholars in addition to the confirm=
ed speakers (cfr. infra) will consist exclusively of plenary sessions, with a=
mple time for discussion. The conference committee encourages proposal submis=
sions by both established and junior researchers. Please send abstracts (ca. =
300 words) and a five line biography via email to Jeroen De Gussem (jedgusse.=
degussem(a)UGent.be) by the =E2=80=8B10th of May. Participants will receive a=
 notification concerning the acceptance of their application by the end of Ma=
y.We expect from our applicants that they have the ability of covering their ow=
n travel costs. Accepted speakers are offered lunches and an invitation to ou=
r conference dinner. Accepted speakers from abroad (any country other than Be=
lgium) will also be offered up to 3 hotel nights in Ghent.The following invited speakers have confirmed their participation: Godfried C=
roenen (University of Liverpool) / Maciej Eder(Pedagogical University of Krak=
=C3=B3w) / Julie Orlemanski (University of Chicago) / Peter Robinson (Univers=
ity of Saskatchewan) / Karina van Dalen-Oskam (University of Amsterdam) / Dav=
