it can provide any kind of output (although you'd have to provide an output
script - there is documentation on how to do this on the site). As of Monday
of this week there was work being done on the Auto Line Recognizer plugin
(that's the piece of TILE that does to auto line recognition) however
version 1.0 should be out any day now if it's not already.Dot
