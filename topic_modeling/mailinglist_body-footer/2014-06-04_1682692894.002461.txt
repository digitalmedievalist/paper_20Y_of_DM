unity to vote on the proposed changes to the Byelaws. As you probably remembe=
r, these changes will simply remove 'wiki' from the wording. *Please note tha=
t this is not a vote on whether or not the wiki should be continued*, but rat=
her on whether we should be formally locked into the wiki or if we should be =
free to use whatever technology we think is best. A vote in favour will allow=
 the possibility of changing, whether now or in future; a vote against means =
that we are required to use a wiki indefinitely.In order to vote, please visit <http://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com/2014/=
06/04/dm-byelaws-vote/> and use the embedded form. Full details of the propos=
ed changes are also available on that web page. You will be asked for your e-=
mail address, but this is only to verify that you are a member of DM and ther=
efore have the right to vote. (If you are subscribed to the DM-L mailing list=
 then you are automatically a member and so you may vote.)Voting will close at midnight GMT on 11 June 2014. The proposed changes will =
pass if they receive a two-thirds majority in favour (as per =C2=A79.4 of the=
 current byelaws). If there are any problems or questions then please don't h=
esitate to get in touch.I will also report separately on the broader discussions regarding infrastruc=
ture in due course.Thanks, and best wishes,Peter (on behalf of the DM Board)--
