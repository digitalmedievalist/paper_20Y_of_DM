Subject: [DIGITALCLASSICIST] New resource
 
We have created a resource at
     http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/mahdiyya-quran/This is a digitisation and backlit digitisation of a C19th copy of the Qur'an.This is a prototype site.  I'd be interest in feedback on oversights and/or
its utility.Please feel free to publicise this resource widely.Roger
