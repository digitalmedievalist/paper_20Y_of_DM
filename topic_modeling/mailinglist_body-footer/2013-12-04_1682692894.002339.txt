Dear colleagues,Here is a newly-published collection of essays that may interest you.Kind greetings,
Claire Clivaz, University of Lausanne (CH)
Digital Humanities in Biblical, Early Jewish and Early Christian Studies, Lei=
den: Brill, 2013.
Edited by Claire Clivaz, University of Lausanne, Andrew Gregory, University o=
f Oxford and David Hamidovic, University of Lausanne,=20
in collaboration with Sara Schulthess, University of LausanneAncient texts, once written by hand on parchment and papyrus, are now increas=
ingly discoverable online in newly digitized editions, and their readers now =
work online as well as in traditional libraries. So what does this mean for h=
ow scholars may now engage with these texts, and for how the disciplines of b=
iblical, Jewish and Christian studies might develop? These are the questions =
that contributors to this volume address. Subjects discussed include textual =
criticism, palaeography, philology, the nature of ancient monotheism, and how=
 new tools and resources such as blogs, wikis, databases and digital publicat=
ions may transform the ways in which contemporary scholars engage with histor=
ical sources. Contributors attest to the emergence of a conscious recognition=
 of something new in the way that we may now study ancient writings, and the =
possibilities that this new awareness raises.http://www.brill.com/products/book/digital-humanities-biblical-early-jewish-a=
