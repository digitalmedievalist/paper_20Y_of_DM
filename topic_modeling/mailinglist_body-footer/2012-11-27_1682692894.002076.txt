Subject: Digital Humanities Meeting: Mining Spatial Descriptions in Medieval =
Charters
=20
You are warmly invited to the next London Digital Humanities Group meeting:11th December, 2012
5.15pm, Jessel Room, Senate House, LondonChartEx: mining spatial descriptions in medieval charters.
www.chartex.orgThe ChartEx consortium is an innovative partnership between historians, archi=
vists, and experts in computer science and artificial intelligence from Canad=
a, the Netherlands, the UK and the US. It is funded by the Digging into Data =
Challenge, 2012-13.The ChartEx Project is developing new ways of exploring the full text content=
 of digital historical records. In particular it is exploring the description=
s of parcels of property found in medieval charters and their associations wi=
th three key entities (people, places and events).The new ChartEx tools will use a combination of Natural Language Processing (=
NLP) and Data Mining to extract information about places, people and events  =
from the charters automatically and find new relationships between them.The project will then build an interactive "virtual workbench" that will allo=
w historians, archivists and others interested in charters to explore the inf=
ormation extracted and add further information and comments.The seminar will present progress to date and invite further discussion.Participants in the Seminar will include historian Sarah Rees Jones (York), c=
omputational linguist Roger Evans (Brighton), and Helen Petrie, Professor of =
Human Computer Interaction (York).All are welcome.  To confirm your attendance, please complete the form at: ht=
