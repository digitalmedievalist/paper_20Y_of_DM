Arabic texts (classical Arabic sources, mostly biographical dictionaries and
chronicles) to be converted into XML format for the following analysis.
Currently I am doing that in MS Word 2007, which, despite all improvements,
does not handle long text files well and crashes from time to time. I was
desperately trying to find a good alternative, but did not succeed so far. I
need a text editor which have/do the following:   - Support for bi-directional text and Unicode;
   - Support for large text files (mine are not too big, but may go up to
   20Mb of TXT in UTF-8; Yaqut’s *Mu‘jam al-Buldan* is ~9Mb, Ibn
‘Imad’s *Shadharat
   al-Dhahab* is ~8Mb; Ibn al-Jawzi’s *al-Muntazam* is 12Mb);
   - Changing Font and its Size;
   - Custom Highlighting: an editable list of symbols and phrases (in
   Arabic) to be highlighted for visibility. The sources I work with have a
   number of technical topoi (most obvious examples are the words like bab,
   fasl, harf etc.) that mark the structure of the book as well as
   transition points between information of different kind (for example, in
   al-Sam‘ani’s *Kitab al-ansab* the explanation of most of nisba names
   begins with phrases like wa-hadhihi-l-nisba ila and ends with wa-l-mashhur
   bi-hadhihi-l-nisba, or wa-ilay-ha, or wa-ntasaba[t] ila etc.). Having
   them highlighted makes the structure of the test highly visible and tagging
   process much faster and easier.
   - The editor should be stable and fast.I will deeply appreciate any comments and suggestions.Best regards,
