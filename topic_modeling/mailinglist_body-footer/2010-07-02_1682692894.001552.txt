Dear All,On behalf of Dr Stuart Lee and the Oxford University Faculty of
English, I am pleased to announce the launch of the Woruldhord
Project, which opened on the 1st of July 2010 and is now receiving
submissions.The Woruldhord Project is a joint initiative of the Oxford University
Computing Services and the Faculty of English. It aims to combine the
expertise of literary scholars, historians, archaeologists, art
historians and linguists together with material from museums,
historical sites and members of the general public to create a
comprehensive online archive of written, visual and audio-visual
material related to Old English and the Anglo-Saxon period.The Project is currently inviting contributions from anyone
researching or teaching on the Anglo-Saxon period at a university
level. We are particularly interested in images, audio/video
recordings, handouts, essays, articles, presentations, spreadsheets,
databases, course notes, lesson plans and materials used in
undergraduate teaching, but welcome submissions of any type.Any material submitted will be made freely available worldwide for
educational purposes on the Project Woruldhord website
(http://projects.oucs.ox.ac.uk/woruldhord/index.html), hosted by the
University of Oxford. However, all intellectual property rights in the
material will be retained by the contributor, contributors will be
named on the site, and all visitors will be provided with a citation
guide enabling them to properly acknowledge the authors of the
resources. Contributors can also, if desired, attach links to their
own or their Universityâ€™s website to their contributions, increasing
their own web presence.Timed to correspond with renewed public interest in the Anglo-Saxons
following the recent discovery of the Staffordshire Hoard, this
project presents an excellent opportunity to apply computing
technology to the study of Anglo-Saxon literature, history and
culture. It also aims to allow members of the public across the world
to access rare or difficult-to-obtain material as well as the
expertise of specialists in the field. We hope that academics and
teachers are willing to share this material, especially if they feel
it will be of benefit to the discipline. The Woruldhord Project
follows on from the Great War Archive
(http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa/), a very successful project
which collected manuscript material, letters and other materials from
the First World War from March-November 2008.
