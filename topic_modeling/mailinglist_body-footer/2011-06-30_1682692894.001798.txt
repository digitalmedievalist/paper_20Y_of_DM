I wonder whether the discussion maybe has lost the original intention of=20
Franz' question.I image his scenario as being this: he has a electronic resource with=20
quotations from the bible which he might has marked up as=20
@cRef=3D"#VUL_GN_20" or something like that. He wants to have these things=20
turned into links (or tool tip content harvested from links, or index=20
entries etc) in the publication of his resource. This should be done=20
automatically and should result in URLs that would be stable over time.=20
What he needs in order to get that, is something we would call "canonic=20
URLs" which is a sort of a PURL.In an ideal world addresses like this would be available:
         http://www.bible.org/vulgata/genesis/20Franz would generate links from his given information via xslt (or=20
another technology) in the process of publishing and would rely on the=20
stability of such a URL because as a PURL, the institution behind=20
bible.org would guarantee for it. Technically there would be a resolver=20
behind what only looks like an URL but is simply a given "name" in fact.=20
And that resolver resolves to the actual technical address ...So if we'd take this ...
    =20
http://www.biblija.net/biblija.cgi?Bible=3DBible&m=3DGn+20&id38=3D1&id8=3D1&p=
os=3D0&set=3D1&l=3Den&idp0=3D39&idp1=3D9
the automatic creation of a link would be possible from=20
@cRef=3D"#VUL_GN_20" but will the URL be stable over time? What will=20
happen at the next technical changeover? Probably there will be no=20
"biblija.cgi?" anymore ...This looks better:
     http://www.bibleserver.com/ref/1020000#/text/VUL/1.Mose20
Well, using this, Franz maybe should have had @cRef=3D"#VUL_1.Mose_20" in=20
his data, but behold!, this works too:=20
http://www.bibleserver.com/#/text/VUL/Genesis20 - so Franz' data is=20
alright already. And these addresses may be stable for the future since=20
with a good resolver would resolve these addresses strings to a=20
different technical address if necessary.
If you use a resolver anyway, of course, this would even be nicer:=20
http://www.bibleserver.com/VUL/1.Mose20The question for the quality and reliability of the text remains. This=20
is connected to the trustworthiness of the institution behind=20
bibleserver.com.
And an address like http://www.bibleserver.com/VUL/1.Mose20 has to be=20
understood as a "default". So even more complex systems are possible=20
here. If there were variant editions of the Vulgata from which texts=20
have been taken, then http://www.bibleserver.com/VUL/1.Mose20 would just=20
result in what would be stated to be the "canonic" version of that=20
verse. But http://www.bibleserver.com/VUL/editionX/1.Mose20 would lead=20
to a specific edition, and =20
http://www.bibleserver.com/VUL/editionX/1.Mose20/image would lead to a=20
digital image of the printed page instead of the "default" presentation=20
of the text as text ...No need to say, that we want to have these "canonic addresses" not just=20
for the bible but for potentially everything (that we want to talk about).Best, Patrick
