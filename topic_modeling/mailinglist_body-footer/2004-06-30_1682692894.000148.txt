Hear, hear! I agree completely -- well, almost. If you're primarily 
delivering static content, it's not all that hard to arrange your XHTML, 
CSS and JavaScript so that it degrades gracefully. My on-line OE grammar 
(http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/research/rawl/IOE/index.html) does 
reasonably well in this respect, I think: it looks best in Mozilla, 
acceptable in IE 5/6 and readable in NS 4.blech. (There you can also see 
my stylesheet philosophy: a default stylesheet, one for the visually 
impaired, and an option to turn off stylesheets--for the PDF set. 
Separate stylesheets for different browsers is madness--Microsoft spends 
its money that way, I believe.) For the kind of advanced functionality 
Martin was describing earlier, I think there is no harm at all in 
expecting users to have an up-to-date browser. My own case in point is 
the Old English Aerobics anthology 
(http://www.engl.virginia.edu/OE/anthology/index.html), which really 
doesn't ask all that much of a browser, but doesn't run in NS 4 and 
never will.Peter--===============6419001462935541111==--
