INVITATION AND SCOPE OF THE WORKSHOP: https://wp.unil.ch/llist/en/
event/comhum2018/You are cordially invited to attend the Workshop on Computational
Methods in the Humanities 2018 (COMHUM 2018), listen to the talks
(including invited talks by Bruno Cornelis, Maristella Agosti, and
Manfred Thaller), and participate in the discussions.It is often said that the digital humanities are “situated at the
intersection of computer science and the humanities,” but what does
this mean?  We believe that the point of using computers in the
humanities is not just to automatically analyze larger amounts of data
or to accelerate research.  We therefore prefer to understand digital
humanities as (1) the study of means and methods of constructing
formal models in the humanities and (2) as the application of these
means and methods for the construction of concrete models in
particular humanities disciplines.  The central research questions are
thus correspondingly (1) which computational methods are most
appropriate for dealing with the particular challenges posed by
humanities research, e.g., uncertainty, vagueness, incompleteness, but
also with different positions (points of view, values, criteria,
perspectives, approaches, readings, etc.)?  And (2) how can such
computational methods be applied to concrete research questions in the
humanities?PROGRAM: https://wp.unil.ch/llist/en/programme/Monday, June 4, 201811:00–11:30 Welcome
