now to turn what started out as a "project" into something more closely
resembling a "society": this would involve particularly establishing
aboard with elected officers.Over the last while we've been working on a set of by-laws that would
allow us to do this. I've posted them to the Wiki as a temporary holding
place: http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/BylawsWhat do people think? We are thinking of planning the first elections
for Lady Day (March 25): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Day-dan
