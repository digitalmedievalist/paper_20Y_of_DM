problem of multiple browsers, etc.But as a user, if it won't run with my preferred browser, I just abandon 
it and never come back to look at it again, even though I have more than 
one browser on my PC. (I keep the other browser -- IE -- just for dire 
emergencies.) I have no idea if this bothers the folks writing the 
programs.
