medieval manuscripts

 * palaeographical method for =E2=80=98Digital' and =E2=80=98Analogue=
' palaeography
 * reassessing the terminology used in manuscript studies and palaeography
 * reports from projects that make use of digitised imagesTo propose a paper, please email a brief abstract (250 words max.) to digipal=
 [at] kcl.ac.uk<http://kcl.ac.uk/>.The deadline for the receipt of submissions is 10.23pm on Friday 14th Septemb=
er 2012Please note that it is our intention to collect selected papers from the symp=
osium as part of a

 can't attend.
Several papers from last year's symposium are being edited as part of our for=
thcoming
volume, "Digital Palaeography" (Ashgate).----------------
