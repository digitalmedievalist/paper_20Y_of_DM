scholarly editing, but certainly the place to inform all of you on a 
school trying to attract less technical advanced people and teach them 
the methods of scholarly editing. So please spread the word:The Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing (IDE) in 
cooperation with the International Center for Archival Sciences (ICARus) 
and the Institute for Austrian Historical Research (IfÖG) has set up 
another Spring School on "Digital Edition" 
<http://www.i-d-e.de/events-des-ide/spring-school-2012>. It will take 
place in Vienna 6.-10.2012 and will introduce into XML, the TEI, other 
connected techniques and standards and the theory of digital editing.The school is adressed to young and more experienced scholars working on 
a critical scholarly edition who are interested in getting an idea of 
the concepts of digital editing and learning the basic skills to create 
one by themselves.The school will be held in German. If you are interested in 
participating please send a short presentation of your project to
