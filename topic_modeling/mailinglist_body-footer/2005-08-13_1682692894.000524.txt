Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear MarjorieAs James has already pointed out, there are a number of varyingly=20
satisfactory ways of dealing with the inescapable fact that a textual=20
artefact can be regarded as having more than one hierarchic structure.=20
The only issue really is deciding on which one to privilege when=20
representing it in XML.Your use of the phrase "rhetorical elements" (plus my recollections of a=20
pleasant visit to Lyon some years ago!) suggests to me that you are=20
trying to mark up the rhetorical structure of an existing text.  This=20
seems a somewhat different kind of structure from the usual structure of=20
prose paragraphs and divisions, in that it can be determined only by=20
some understanding of the text and also of other texts like it, and also=20
in that it rarely if ever has any kind of associated conventional=20
rendering.The mechanism suggested by the TEI for this purpose is described, rather=20
obscurely, in the chapter on "Simple Analytic Mechanisms", in particular=20
in section 15.3 on  "Spans and Interpretations", where there is an=20
example showing how the narrative structure of an extract from the=20
Poetic Edda might be encoded. Essentially  it recommends what is now=20
fashionably know as "standoff" annotation,  in which a special kind of=20
pointer element (a "span") is used to indicate a stretch of text and to=20
associate a particular interpretive label with it. Such spans can be=20
organized hierarchically in the same way as other XML elements. The=20
stretches of texts indicated will often be existing "structural" XML=20
elements such as paragraphs or sections, but do not need to: an empty=20
<anchor> (or milestone)  element can be inserted at any necessary point=20
to act as a target for a link of this kind.I would like to revise this particular section of the Guidelines for P5=20
in order to make it a bit more accessible: it would be great to include=20
an example from Voragine!best wishesLou
