         I don't know of anything for Macs, Linux, etc., but for Windows, 
you might look at http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php. I've found that 
easy to work with. We're using this for the forthcoming editions of 
Bodleian Library's MS Laud 581 and BL, MS Additional 35287 in the Piers 
Plowman Electronic Archive.Best,
DugAt 10:53 AM 10/23/2004 -0600, you wrote:
