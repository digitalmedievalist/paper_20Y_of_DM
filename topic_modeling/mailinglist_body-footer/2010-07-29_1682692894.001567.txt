manuscripts as the source is, as far as I can tell, exactly the same as it
is for any other digital data anywhere, and vast amounts of ink (real and
virtual) has been used discussing the issue. Although it's a few years old
now, you might start with the article "Architecture and Technologies for
Trusted Digital Repositories," Jantz and Giarlo, D-Lib Magazine 2005 (
http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june05/jantz/06jantz.html - not really as technical
as it may sound, and includes some important definitions), then move your
research on from there. Although I'm not sure that there are many real and
true TDRs even now, it's a fine ideal to start with. Although Dan O'Donnell
is correct that many older file formats are still able to be read far past
the time we might expect it, the issue of "digital preservation" is much
more extensive than simply "can I still have access to the data on this
file" (at least, if you ask a librarian about it  :-)  ).DotOn Thu, Jul 29, 2010 at 1:12 AM, Daniel Mondekar <mondekar(a)hrstud.hr> wrote:>  Dear Digital Medievalists and TEI members,
