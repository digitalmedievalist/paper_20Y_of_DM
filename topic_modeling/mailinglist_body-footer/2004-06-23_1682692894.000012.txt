implementation of XML For Overlapping Structures I saw at the
ALLC-ACH.  The abstract for the paper is here:http://www.hum.gu.se/allcach2004/AP/html/prop104.htmlAlthough it is using a non XML data model (LMNL) it was
able to produce well-formed XML.  The demo involved a java
client highlighting from one random bit of xml to another
random bit of xml and providing an annotation, and then
overlapping part of this annotation with another one, etc.
(Sounds like a good teaching tool frankly, mark students
on their annotations, without them needing to know XML).The resulting XML followed a milestone principle, but used
child elements in the 'start' tag to contain the annotation.Not exactly the issue Peter and Lou are debating but
might make interesting reading for a related issue.-James
