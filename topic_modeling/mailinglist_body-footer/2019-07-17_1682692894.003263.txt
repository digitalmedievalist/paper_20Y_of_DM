Archeometric analysis of inks from Coptic manuscriptsThe main aim of this research project is to record the technological evolutio=
n of writing inks in early Christian Egypt. We aim at reconstructing a geo-ch=
ronological map displaying the types of ink used in different areas. Our mult=
i-analytical approach consists of different imaging and spectroscopic techniq=
ues to detect the composition of black and coloured inks. Once enough data ha=
ve been collected, we will be able to place in time and space unknown manuscr=
ipts. In the meanwhile, our work supports palaeographic and codicological stu=
dies, helping distinguish different writing phases on a manuscript or in the =
reconstruction of ancient libraries.Seminar livestream: https://youtu.be/aBJq1OL80CEFull programme: http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2018.htmlALL WELCOME
