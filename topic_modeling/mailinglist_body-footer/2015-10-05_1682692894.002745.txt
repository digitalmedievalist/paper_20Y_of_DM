OriettaDigital Editing Now: Call for digital posters=207-9 January 2016     Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Hum=
anities (CRASSH)University of Cambridge=20Graduate students and early career scholars with interests in digital edition=
 work are invited to submit proposals for digital posters relating to this fi=
eld. The selected posters (a main page either in web page format, with the op=
tion of links to one or two additional pages, or in pdf) will be projected fo=
r five-minute presentations during the course of the conference. Those presen=
ting will receive a bursary towards the costs of attendance.=20Please send your proposal (maximum 200 words) to Tom Taylor (tmt24(a)cam.ac.u=
k) by Friday 23 October 2015.=20In recent years, there has been a significant shift in scholarly culture and =
funding strategies towards digital formats for edition projects. This is driv=
en by the potential for new forms of production, presentation and access that=
 the digital promises. And it involves a reassessment of the conventions that=
 have determined editorial practice in the age of print. This conference will=
 gather interested parties together to exchange ideas about the state of digi=
tal editing and its future potential. It will also provide the opportunity to=
 ask critical questions about the limits of the digital. How should we place =
ourselves relative to fundamental issues of authority/openness, durability/fl=
uidity? Can we establish a set of ideal types for digital editorial method, o=
r would its optimal strengths rather lie in more hybrid forms, including a pr=
oductive mode of cohabitation with the print formats that it appears to want =
to supersede?While the conference will be fully open in historical and disciplinary terms,=
 the exchange that is proposed here will be focused around four key sets of c=
oncerns, which cut across differences of material and context:=20Material texts and digital forms
=20What possibilities does digital editing provide to do justice to the material=
 character of the texts it seeks to present, to their physical bedding and th=
e means of their inscription? Can it find creative and meaningful ways of get=
ting close to the experience of the archive? And how does it respond to the n=
eed for the kinds of durability and reliability associated with its physical =
counterparts?=20Editorial agents and agencies (providers, in various roles, and users)
=20Digital editions are the collaborative product of a range of types of experti=
se. They bring different agents together (academics, archivists, information =
technologists) in what can be a delicate process of negotiation between syste=
ms of knowledge. At the same time, users =E2=80=93 expert and otherwise =E2=
=80=93 experience, and in some cases reconfigure, digital editions, in variou=
s ways. How can the collective agency of these networks be made most fruitful?=20Chronology and topography (genetic and diplomatic methods)
=20Critical editions always have to deal with the tension between presenting the=
 historical genesis of their material and the spatial lay-out of its iteratio=
ns. How can digital functions convey the relations between the two in dynamic=
 and enlightening fashion?=20Digital edition and performance practices
=20Digital editing offers the means to open up and enliven a range of different =
cultural materials. How might it provide a new basis for performance practice=
s, in both live and digitally mediated forms, and in combinations of the two?=
 And how might this extend beyond material self-evidently for performance (mu=
sic, drama) to other types of resource? =20***********************************
