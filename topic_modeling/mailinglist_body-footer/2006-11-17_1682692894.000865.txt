The Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College LondonCCH is both a department with responsibility for its own academic
programme
and a research centre promoting the appropriate application of computing
in
humanities research. In its latter capacity, it is looking for someone
to
assist with the technical development work in research projects. The
projects cover a wide range of humanities disciplines, including
medieval
studies, history, literature and linguistics, and music, and also
include a
number of more general information management projects in both
humanities
and the social sciences.The successful candidate to this position would be required to analyse a
wide variety of humanities materials and to model them using XML-related
technologies; to design, write and modify programs to search, query,
retrieve and display them; and to collaborate in the creation of
integrated
HTML-based interfaces to publish them.Experience in creating and manipulating XML documents in a range of
XML-related standards and technologies (DTDs, XPath, XSLT) is essential,
as
is familiarity with standards-compliant XHTML and CSS. Awareness of the
Text
Encoding Initiative's guidelines and/or of emerging XML technologies
(XSLT
2.0, XQuery and Schemas) is highly desirable.Proven experience in creating dynamic XML-based applications using
technologies such as Cocoon and/or native XML databases would be a
significant advantage.In addition you will need to have a good understanding of how research
is
conducted in the humanities and social sciences and will need to be able
to
work effectively as part of a team, as well as independently. The
successful
candidate should have good communication skills and the ability to
document
their work in clear written English.This appointment is on the RA1A scale, currently ranging from 20,645 to
30,902 per annum plus of 2,323 London Allowance.For further details and an application form, please contact Personnel
