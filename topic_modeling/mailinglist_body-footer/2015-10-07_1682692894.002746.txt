f vHMML<http://vhmml.org/>, an online environment for manuscript studies. Cre=
ation of vHMML has been supported by a National Leadership grant from the Ins=
titute of Museum and Library Services, with additional support from Arcadia F=
und of London. You can read more about the whole project here<http://vhmml.or=
g/about>.You'll find instruction in Latin and Syriac scripts in School<http://=
www.vhmml.org/school>, Latin and Syriac annotated images in Folio<http://foli=
o.as.uky.edu/>, answers to all of your terminological questions (=E2=80=9Cwha=
t does rinceaux mean, anyway?=E2=80=9D) in Lexicon<http://vhmml.org/lexicon>,=
 and lots of bibliography in Reference<http://vhmml.org/reference> (exportabl=
e to Zotero, and with links to digital versions in archive.org). For now vHMM=
L will take you to our online catalog, OLIVER, but starting in early 2016 it =
will link to the new vHMML Reading Room where registered users will be able t=
o browse thousands of complete manuscripts for free.vHMML will be continually updated and enriched. Later in 2015 there will be m=
ore Syriac lessons, including transcription practice, and in 2016 we'=
ll add Arabic and Armenian, and possibly other traditions.Please have a look, and let us know your suggestions for improvement or addit=
