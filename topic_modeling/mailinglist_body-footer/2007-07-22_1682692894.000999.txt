Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI didn't want to release a new version of Junicode till I had completed 
the MUFI spec in the Regular face, but I needed to fix a bug. If you 
have seen problems with the BoldItalic face in OpenOffice for Windows, 
you may want to get the new version. Or pick it up if you are desperate 
for MUFI abbreviations and punctuation that were not yet in 0.6.14. Or 
if you have been dissatisfied with the look of F109, rounded d. This 
release also contains a file, aelfric_job.pdf, that illustrates certain 
typographical niceties especially for Old English (and Old Icelandic), 
available if you use advanced applications like XeTeX and InDesign.I forgot to release a source package for 0.6.14, but I will do that shortly.Peter--===============0044849086669747618==--
