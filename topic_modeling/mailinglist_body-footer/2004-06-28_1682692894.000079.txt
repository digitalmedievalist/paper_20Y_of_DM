just build them to the standards and wait for browers/users to=20
catch up?  Obviously while I'd like to do the latter, in practice=20
I do the former.  I do try to avoid the browser-specific hacks=20
that were mentioned earlier however (for the already mentioned=20
fear of their need for migration).  This is common in CSS to=20
produce hacks that display the same in MSIE and other browsers. =20
Better, in my opinion, to only use CSS that most modern=20
browsers understand.-James---
