that are working on this kind of framework: http://www.metascholar.org/
and http://www.ockham.org/ . I haven't kept up with them recently to see
what's actually been deployed, though. They are producing open-source
tools to do this kind of work, so it would be interesting to try them
out in the digital medieval community.Among digitization projects the most radical I'm aware of is Project
Runeberg in Sweden, which allows users to proofread the OCR text against
the page images and submit corrections. http://runeberg.org (the server
seems to be slow at the moment, though). Sample page:

Subject: [dm-l] virtual commonsAt Kalamazoo last year, I heard a discussion of a project that was
planning to use an virtual commons--i.e. a place where users could
contribute to the development of the project through shared annotation,
textual development, and the like (I think they actually described it as
a piazza. As I understood the idea, and in discussion at the Digital
Medievalist business meeting a couple of people mentioned similar
proposal, the idea was to build what we might now think of as adding
wiki-like capabilities to a larger, unified, scholarly project.Does anybody know of any scholarly projects that have actually
implemented such virtual piazza-type interaction? I'm interested in
projects that allows arbitrary users to contribute to the content,
either with or without refereeing.-d
