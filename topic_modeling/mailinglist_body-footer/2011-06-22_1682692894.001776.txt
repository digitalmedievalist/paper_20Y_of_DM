would transform the humanities in 1979 when the latest in digital technology
was a microfiche concordance.  The actual optical technology to read the
carbonized papyri at Herculaneum or to optically reconstruct destroyed
sections of manuscripts are a few instances I can think of where machines
will do something that humans cannot.  Other than that, while it's great to
have manuscript facsimiles available on the web and to catalog and
communicate over the Internet, how does this change anything other than the
ease with which we can do our research?
   Like you, I have been waiting for years to hear about how digital
humanities is fundamentally different from the old humanities in a new
medium.  And this is not to denigrate new projects for new media, but to
keep some historical perspective on the long term value of what scholars
have been doing since ancient times.
