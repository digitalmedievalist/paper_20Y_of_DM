standard taxonomy for attribution of collaboration in the sciences and was
thinking it would be good to have a similar one for the digital
humanities:http://credit.casrai.org/proposed-taxonomy/Is anyone here familiar with something similar?For our own part, on our project we follow a similar protocol for our TEI,
where we have the following levels of attribution:Editor (person responsible for editorial decisions)
Contributor (all scholars who made authorial level contributions)
Additional Credit (all scholars and developers who helped transform or
augement the data)
Changelog (a list similar to a git commit that tracks and attributes all
changes in the published TEI file)An example can be found here: http://syriaca.org/place/78/teiBest,
Dave
