posium
Dear all,As the days darken and the wind starts to bite, we thought it might be worth =
remembering that there's more
to a UK November than fireworks and cold weather. With that in mind, the Digi=
Pal team at King's College London,
in association with the Department of English, Linguistics and Cultural Studi=
es, University of Westminster, are
delighted to announce the programme for their "Digital Approaches to Medieval=
 Script and Image" Symposium."Digital Approaches to Medieval Script and Image"Date:   Thursday 22nd November 2012Venue: University of Westminster, 115 New Cavendish Street, W1W 6UW (Room CLG=
.09)Time:    9.30am-5.30pmIf you haven't registered for the Symposium as yet, then now would seem to be=
 the ideal moment to snap up one of the
few remaining places. Registration is free -- all you have to do is send an e=
mail (with your name and affiliation as you would
like them to appear on your name badge) to digipal [at] kcl.ac.uk<http://kcl.=
ac.uk/>Coffee and registration will be at 9.30am and the Symposium will start at 9.5=
0am. There will be refreshments, but lunch
isn't included (we wanted to keep registration free, and it turns out that th=
ere's no such thing as a free lunch).Looking forward to seeing you on the 22nd,Stewart Brookes and Peter Stokes (King's College London) and Louise Sylvester=
