Digital Medievalist is an indexed (see below), open access and
internationally peer-reviewed scholarly journal, devoted to topics likely
to be of interest to medievalists working with digital media, though they
need not be exclusively medieval in focus. It publishes work of original
research and scholarship, theoretical articles on digital topics, notes on
technological topics, commentary pieces discussing developments in the
field, bibliographic and review articles, tutorials, and project reports. The
journal also encourages reviews of books and major electronic sites and
projects. All contributions are reviewed before publication by authorities
in humanities computing.The journal is published online as a continuous volume and issue throughout
the year. Articles are made available as soon as they are ready to ensure
that there are no unnecessary delays in getting content publicly available.
Special collections of articles are welcomed and will be published as part
of the normal issue, but also within a separate collection page.The journal’s publisher, Open Library of Humanities, focuses on making
content discoverable and accessible through indexing services. Content is
also archived around the world to ensure long-term availability. Ubiquity
Press journals are indexed by the following services: Nordic list, Google
Scholar, Chronos, ExLibris, EBSCO Knowledge Base,     JISC KB+, SHERPA
RoMEO, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), EBSCOHost, OpenAire and
