The Digital.Humanities @ Oxford Summer School (DHOxSS) is an annual
event for anyone working in the Digital Humanities. This year's Summer
School will be held on 8 - 12 July, at the University of Oxford. If
you are a researcher, project manager, research assistant, or student
of the Humanities, this is an opportunity for you to learn about the
tools and methodology of digital humanities, and to make contact with
others in your field. You will be introduced to topics spanning from
creating, managing, analysing, modelling, visualizing, to publication
of digital data for the Humanities. Visit
http://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/dhoxss/2013/ for more information.With the DHOxSS's customisable schedule, you book on one of our
five-day workshops, and supplement this by booking several guest
lectures from experts in their fields.The main five-day training workshops this year are:1. Cultural Connections: exchanging knowledge and widening
participation in the Humanities
2. How to do Digital Humanities: Discovery, Analysis and Collaboration
3. A Humanities Web of Data: publishing, linking and querying on the
semantic web.
4. An Introduction to XML and the Text Encoding Initiative
5. An Introduction to XSLT for Digital HumanistsThere are a variety of evening events including a peer-reviewed poster
session to give delegates a chance to demonstrate their work to the
other delegates and speakers. The Thursday evening sees an elegant
drinks reception and three-course banquet at historic Queen's College,
Oxford! (Well worth it!)DHOxSS is a collaboration for Digital.Humanities @ Oxford between the
University of Oxford's IT Services, the Oxford e-Research Centre
