views/versions of the TEI DTD/Schema, especially for inexperienced users
like me. IMHO the UI should be modified to become a sort of "wizard" (if
you want I can expand on this).> Roma is very definitely intended to generate DTDs as well as schemas,

tei-c.uk only mentioning schema production.> However,

stay with P4 or move to P5 (and possibly schema?). Going to ask this
same question on the TEI ml.> At present Roma's author, Sebastian Rahtz, is in a part of  the world
