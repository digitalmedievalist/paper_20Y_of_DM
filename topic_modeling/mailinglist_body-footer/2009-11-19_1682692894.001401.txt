early days of listservs was not that twitter needs similar controls=20
(moderation, etc.), but that it is a new type of communication that=20
participants are still learning to understand and for which etiquette is=20
still developing.  The fact is that people do misunderstand how the=20
feeds work. I can't see them stopping. But that doesn't mean that people=20
won't find them intimidating or assign responsibility to the=20
organisation being tweeted about.I was shocked at the TEI to learn that people find contributing to=20
listservs intimidating (I seem to have been born without that gene). But=20
they report that they do. I don't think that there is anything to be=20
done about twitter feeds or that one ought to do something about them=20
(other than perhaps encourage people to be kind to each other). But it=20
seems to me still a fact for any organisation that is trying to=20
encourage inclusiveness and openness that people who are already=20
intimidated by contributing in a public form are likely to find the=20
twitter conference even more so. Over time everybody will (have to) get=20
used to it, of course, because it is inescapable (and quite useful).--danGabriel Bodard wrote:
