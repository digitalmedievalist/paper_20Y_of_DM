but the general idea): I want to have the line numbering in the 
concordance I'm building be in conformance to line numbering in a 
"standard reference system" (to use TEI jargon), that is, the line 
numbering in a standard edition, and there are missing lines and 
stanzas, duplicated lines, inversions of lines, etc. in my text as 
compared to the standard line numbering--a pretty common situation in 
medieval and early modern texts. The standard reference system also has 
several series of line numbers beginning at 1 and extending to the 
hundreds. So I can use automatic numbering to generate an initial 
matching of number to line for each of the chunks, but I need to fiddle 
a bit around the anomalies and then actually stick the numbers to the 
lines permanently before concordancing.Thanks to everyone for the excellent suggestions.Murray
