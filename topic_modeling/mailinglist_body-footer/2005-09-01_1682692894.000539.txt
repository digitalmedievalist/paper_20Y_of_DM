new documents on its website ELEC, the free online editions of the Ecole 
des Chartes (_http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr <http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/>_).The Obituary of Saint-Mont
(_http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/obituairesaintmont/_).
Ms. Marie-José Gasse-Grandjean, researcher at the University of 
Burgundy, publishes the first critical edition of this manuscript, along 
with the document itself digitized by Metz public library (médiathèque 
du Pontiffroy). The obituary, which has been dated 1406, was written for 
Guillaume de la Perche, prior of Saint-Mont, in order to list the names 
of all monastery benefactors and to celebrate their memory.
This nice "book of practice", not quite a «*nécrologe* », nor a calendar 
nor a «censier» (liber censuum), is a unique source of information on 
everyday life among a small monastic community depending on the Abbey of 
Remiremont.The Formulary of Odart Morchesne (established according the manuscript 
ms BnF fr. 5024)
(_http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/morchesne/_).
This edition, prepared by Mr. Olivier Guyotjeannin, professor at the 
École des chartes, and Mr. Serge Lusignan, professor at the University 
of Montreal, with the help of students of the Ecole des Chartes, 
contains about 270 models of acts which were useful for notaries and 
secretaries working for the King of France in the XVth century. This 
handbook is remarkable because the acts were annnotated by the author 
himself. The richness of the vocabulary is also outstanding. This is why 
the École des chartes will publish this document twice : there will be a 
print version (to be published in the collection Mémoires et documents 
de l’École des chartes) more convenient for reading and an electronic 
version allowing to access and search the text.The Language of Acts, proceedings of the XIth International congress of 
diplomatics
Troyes, Sept. 11-13, 2003 (_http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/sommaire163.html_).
The eleventh plenary session of the International Commission of 
diplomatics was organized by the École des chartes. The various 
workshops focused on the language of acts, a topic which had emerged 
after a survey done by the École des chartes research center “History, 
mémory, heritage” (EA 3624). Papers are published on the Website as soon 
as Mr. Olivier Guyotjeannin receives them.
Digital cartularies of the region Ile-de-France 
(_http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/cartulaires/_)
The library of the École des chartes has a collection of early XXth 
century editions of cartularies of the region Ile-de-France which 
surrounds Paris.
This digitization project, supported by the French Ministry of 
Education, has three aims:    *      to provide a digital facsimile of these rare editions which are
      not available in most libraries    *      to allow browsing through full-text acts and indexes and to
      provide a critical presentation of the edition (critical apparatus
      by the students of the Ecole des Chartes under the direction of
      Olivier Guyotjeannin)    *      to enhance digitization by providing access and search tools
      linking text and images, by creating tables for browsing, by
      allowing full-text search and the creation of personal data files.
The following editions are available on our site :
- Cartulary of the Abbey of Saint-Martin de Pontoise
- Cartulary of the Abbey of Notre-Dame de la Roche
- Cartulary of the royal Abbey of Montmartre
- Cartulary of the Abbey of Porrois
- Priory of Saint-Germain-en-Laye
- Liber testamentorum Sancti Martini de Campis
- Cartulary and censier (liber censuum) of Saint-Merry de Paris
- Cartulary of Saint-Spire de CorbeilThe most recent technologies in electronic publishing were used to 
produce these documents. Thanks to the standards chosen by the École des 
chartes (METS, TEI, XML), it is easy to browse through the documents, to 
make a full-text search 
_http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/exist/rechercher.php_ and to create 
indexes. Electronic documents produced by the École des chartes abide by 
TEI recommendations, thus promoting the durability and the 
interoperability of data among the international community dedicated to 
electronic edition in the field of Humanities (_http://www.tei-c.org 
<http://www.tei-c.org/>_).Best regards,

Electronic publisher at the Ecole des chartes--===============1912537496441383708==--
