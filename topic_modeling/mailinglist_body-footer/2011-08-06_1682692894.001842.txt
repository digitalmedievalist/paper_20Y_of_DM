medieval sermons (post 1200), I was hoping to make use of full-text digital
sermon editions.  However, apart from the Repertorium of Middle English
Prose Sermons (http://www.hull.ac.uk/middle_english_sermons/ , partial but
hopefully will receive additional fundings) and the sermons of Voragine (
http://www.sermones.net/) I have failed to find anything of use, either in
Latin or the vernacular.  A newcomer to the field, I might be missing the
obvious, and would be grateful for any suggestions.Eyal Poleg--===============0061780014572216830==
