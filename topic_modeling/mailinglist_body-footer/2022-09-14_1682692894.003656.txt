By the end of the last century, the cultural impact of the first mobile
devices and ubiquitous computing led to the expansion of a specific
media ecology marked by a hybrid condition, where the body's
performativity presented itself as an unprecedented approach to the
cyber world. There are many actors involved: companies, service
platforms, governments, hacker communities, and last but not least,
artists who (as often has been the case in the history of New Media Art)
underpin technical shifts, finding an exceptionally active role in the
establishment of terminology and the shaping of the
aesthetic-technological landscape. From this comes an interesting
interdependency with the mobile business and telecommunication
companies, which in turn are looking for imaginative paths to establish
themselves in the just emerging field of handheld applications. A
productive exercise in which the video game industry will also claim its
own identity, amidst totally artistic figurations or more horizontal
collective explorations, where augmented reality, network systems, and
technologically advanced psychogeographic memories enter the commercial
domain and then flow back into creativity.Best regards,
Paolo Monella
