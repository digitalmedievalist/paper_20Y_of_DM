 corpus. Why should we do distant reading? We can see many reasons including =
word sense induction, sentiment analysis, network analysis which were the one=
 we were looking for.            Through we think sentiment analysis stricto sensu is not possible=
 in Latin, we aim to provide a way to do that quantitatively through context =
and network analysis. This does not replace the meme of conventional scholars=
hip; where an expert reader parses a text and pronounces on the nature of its=
 sentiment. Rather, we think that the proper nature of the Latin exemplum and=
 auctoritas is liable to support interpretation by polarizing words according=
 to their strict meaning(s). The Clotho project is divided in two tools. The =
first one is based on python software, which enables the distant reading of t=
he corpus and the export of its results. The other is a PHP platform which en=
ables a team or a crowd to annotate and clean the results. Both are relativel=
y easy to install and fully open source so new functionalities of wide applic=
ation can be added.            For this project, there have been two outputs:                        - the first one is Cicero's Network which has been re=
alised with an earlier version of Clotho's Python interface                        - the second one is Lasciva Roma, a project which wil=
l be launched during the seminar, whose aim is to annotate the Latin semantic=
 field of sexuality.Speakers:Anthony GlaiseFormer MA student at Paris-IV Sorbonne, preparing Agr?gation's exams at Paris=
 IV-Sorbonne and at Ecole Normale Sup?rieure. Anthony worked on the Greek Chr=
istian literature of the 4th century and more precisely on anti-Judaic works =
by John Chrysostom.Thibault Clerice            Research Developer at the Center for e-Research, Kings College Lo=
ndon, and MA student at the Ecole des Chartes ( Paris ). Thibault's works foc=
us on both crowd-sourcing and Ancient Rome genders and sexuality. His current=
 MA Thesis topic tries to enlighten the possibilities of digital methods in L=
atin onomastics and anthropology.
