symposium series on Global DH into its fourth year. Digital humanities
scholarship continues to be driven by work at the intersections of a range
of distinct disciplines and an ethical commitment to preserve and broaden
access to cultural materials.Focused on these issues of social justice, we invite work at the
intersections of critical DH; race and ethnicity; feminism,
intersectionality, and gender; and anti-colonial and postcolonial
frameworks to participate.Given the growth of these fields within the digital humanities,
particularly in under-resourced and underrepresented areas, a number of
complex issues surface, including, among others, questions of ownership,
cultural theft, virtual exploitation, digital rights, endangered data
<http://endangereddataweek.org/>, and the digital divide. DH communities
have raised and responded to these issues, pushing the field forward. We
view the 2019 symposium as an opportunity to broaden the conversation about
these issues. Scholarship that works across borders with foci on
transnational partnerships and globally accessible data is especially
welcome. Additionally, we define the term "humanities" rather broadly to
incorporate the discussion of issues that encourage interdisciplinary
understanding of the humanities.This symposium, which will include a mixture of presentation types,
welcomes 300-word proposals related to any of these issues, and
particularly on the following themes and topics by *Thursday, November 15,
