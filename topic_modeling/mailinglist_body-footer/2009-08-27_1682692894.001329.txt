http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/developing/webapps/authentication.html
and the sections beneath it in the left-hand menu?  I believe one
should be able to handle the authentication and authorization entirely
in cocoon.  I've only set it up in the context of eXist where you are
authenticating against the users in the eXist database.-JamesOn Wed, Aug 26, 2009 at 17:16, Daniel Paul
