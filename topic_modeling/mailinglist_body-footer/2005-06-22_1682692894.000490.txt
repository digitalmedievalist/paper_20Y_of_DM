text for research is that the former is not necessarily an intellectual 
effort. The intellectual effort has been made by those that studied 
people's letter-writing habits and needs and designed the Open Office 
XML format.You're right of course in advocating the use of tools that wherever 
possible hide the complexity of markup. But what these tools can hide is 
only the admittedly not very pleasant sight of lots of brackets and 
ampersands. All of the other complexities (e.g. what in TEI terms would 
be called add's and del's and unclear's and gap's and app's and rdg's 
and all of these nested and/or overlapping...) are there because digital 
editions do things that are complex. You need to understand them one way 
or the other. > The research value is in the act of structuring, not in the

purposes. But we should also try to create enduring digital resources. 
For durability, ease of maintenance and mutual intelligibility it is 
important to try to stick to standards (and therefore, to learn them).Peter--===============0079583511528036332==--
