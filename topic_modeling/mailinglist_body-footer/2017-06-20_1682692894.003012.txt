Cultural Heritage and Global Change=E2=80=9D (JPI-CH) of the European Union, =
the
partners are developing cost-effective solutions for querying large sets of
handwritten document images. With IRHT and A2iA (France), the Universities
of Valencia (Spain) and Groningen (Netherlands) as well as the French
National Archive, it gathers Computer Science, Humanities and Cultural
Heritage institutions in order to produce technology to generate new,
research-based knowledge from historical manuscripts. As a challenging and
particularly interesting case study, we have indexed the large collection
of the Tr=C3=A9sor des Chartes' registers produced by the French roya=
l chancery
(Paris, Archives Nationales, JJ7 =E2=80=93 JJ209).*Now we are proud to announce that you can search the plain text in the
Tr=C3=A9sor des Chartes' registers and provide feedback
<http://prhlt-kws.prhlt.upv.es/himanis/>: It is ready to be used and tested
by all interested users worldwide!*
http://prhlt-kws.prhlt.upv.es/himanis/<http://prhlt-kws.prhlt.upv.es/himanis/>
This is a prototype and beta version, which will be amended and will change
over the next months, with new functionalities (navigate through hits,
display of abstracts and editions) and with additional volumes to be
indexed from the French National Library and the National Archive..The project website is: http://www.himanis.org/
The search interface into the corpus: http://prhlt-kws.prhlt.upv.es/
himanis/ <http://prhlt-kws.prhlt.upv.es/himanis/>
Additional explanations about the interface: https://himanis.hypotheses.
org/105 <https://himanis.hypotheses.org/105>You can search with boolean operators and word sequences (for the syntax,
check on https://himanis.hypotheses. org/105
<https://himanis.hypotheses.org/105>)You can help us measuring the precision of our results:
- please click on highlighted hits to confirm whether the word is correctly
spotted or not;
- please double click on a missed hit if you see it on the page (it will be
added to the index for all users to search from the next day)Two simple examples as a beginning:
- "scriptor" within the whole corpus: http://prhlt-kws.prhlt.upv.es/
himanis/index.php?q=3Dscriptor& t=3D10&feedback=3D1
<http://prhlt-kws.prhlt.upv.es/himanis/index.php?q=3Dscriptor&t=3D10&feedback=
=3D1>
- "pelerinage" on one page : http://prhlt-kws.prhlt.upv.es/
himanis/index.php/ui/show/ chancery/147/853?q=3Dpelerinage& t=3D50&feedback=

<http://prhlt-kws.prhlt.upv.es/himanis/index.php/ui/show/chancery/147/853?q=
=3Dpelerinage&t=3D50&feedback=3D1>The complete indexing results from an automated, image analysis process.
You may find unexpected or false hits: for example, abbreviations are
expanded automatically and it is needless to say that they are error-prone;
likewise place and person names are slightly less well spotted. You can
enhance the hit list by setting the "confidence" rate (between 0 and 100).We hope that you will be as thrilled as we are to present these results and
we invite you to test, give feedback and send further comments, critics and
suggestions to himanis(a)irht.cnrs.fr!Best regardsDominique Stutzmann
