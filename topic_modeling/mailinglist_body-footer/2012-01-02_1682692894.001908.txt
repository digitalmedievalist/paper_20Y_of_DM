appropriate software - if there is such a software.The problem is: I want do know whether Hincmar of Reims quotes  
somewhere in his many texts Aulus Cornelius Celsus. The texts form  
both authors are all digital available (dMGH, Brepolis Text Bases,  
Patrologia Latina Database), but is there any program that could  
search all these texts for similarities in wording and find phrases  
containing the same words - even in different word forms, order etc.?  
I doubt it, but I hope there is such a tool I don't know yet.
