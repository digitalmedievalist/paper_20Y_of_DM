siasm and willingness to take on roles.I've taken a look at Els's doodle poll (thanks, Els!). I'd like to suggest Tu=
esday, September 15, 8am, or Thursday, September 17. 8am EDT (GMT -4).  I hav=
e a slight preference for Tuesday, but let me know what your thoughts are.Should we ask that a representative from the early stage researchers group co=
me? Since we are deciding roles for the board, it's probably not necessary fo=
r everyone in that group to be there, but it might be good to have one repres=
entative there. I'm cc'ing Jamie for his thoughts.Also, I would like to try a video meeting. Does anyone object? If we do a vid=
eo meeting, someone would need to take minutes. Volunteers if so?LynnFrom: Rose Faunce <rose.faunce(a)anu.edu.au<mailto:rose.faunce(a)anu.edu.au>>

Subject: DM RolesThank you everyone for indicating your preferences. I have drafted a list. My=
 apologies in advance for any mistakes. I am not sure how many people are nee=
ded for each of the roles, so I added the names of everyone who nominated for=
 a role. If anyone wants to swap out of something, happy to make changes - ju=
st let me know. At our next meeting we can 'chat' about the roles and get goi=
ng on what needs to be done.Have a good weekend...
