of Antiquaries of London, and having oddly not found a catalogue for it in
a Big 10 research library yesterday, though I clearly recall having seen
one somewhere, or at least having seen a reference to it, I googled and
found this wonderful site:                http://www.a2a.org.uk/"Access to Archives" billing itself as "The English strand of the UK
archives network."  A catalogue entry--based on Ker's MMBL but going
somewhat beyond it--was there, much to my joy.  I share the information of
this site with you.
        Though I prefer a catalogue in my lap, because I value browsing,
this served the immediate need.  Still, to quote our founder, we are
getting there.--
