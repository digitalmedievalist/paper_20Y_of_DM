rganize the international Workshop:On the Way to the Future of Digital Manuscript Studies
Nijmegen, 27-29 October 2021Over the last decades, the ability to exploit digital potential has radically=
 impacted research in the field of manuscript studies. From the most basic fa=
cilities, such as the increasing availability of digitized images and documen=
ts, to sophisticated attempts at automatizing the entire process of critical =
editing, the development of digital tools is extraordinary: it has created un=
precedented opportunities to mine the data, achieve innovative results, and d=
isplay them, in ways which previously could only be imagined. In such a dynam=
ic context, the number of valuable enterprises continues to grow: the time is=
 ripe for a consideration of the achievements already obtained, and of the fo=
undations that our current work is laying for long-term development of the fi=
eld. Through the organization of this workshop, the ERC Project PASSIM seeks =
to provide an occasion to pursue this goal.Scientific Committee: Mariken Teeuwen (Utrecht Universiteit - Huygens ING-KNA=
W), Olivier Hekster (Radboud Universiteit - KNAW), Shari Boodts (Radboud Univ=
ersiteit), Gleb Schmidt (Radboud Universiteit), Riccardo Macchioro (Radboud U=
niversiteit).
Confirmed Speakers: Marjorie Burghart, Mike Kestemont, Thomas KÃ¶ntges, I=
nka Moilanen, Elena Pierazzo, Matthieu Pignot, Philipp Roelli, Dominique Stut=
zmann, Mariken Teeuwen, Anne-Marie Turcan-Verkerk, Martin Wallraff.Venue. The workshop will be held on 27-29 October 2021, either on location in=
 Nijmegen (ideally), in a hybrid form, or online depending on the development=
 of the Covid-emergency. Board and lodging expenses will be borne by the Orga=
nization; unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee coverage of travel costs =
at this time.
Proceedings. We plan to publish the Proceedings as quickly as possible after =
the workshop as a volume or special issue of a relevant journal.CALL FOR PAPERS
We are glad to announce the opening of the Call for Papers for 25 minutes lon=
g presentations.Abstract Submission
If you would like to present a lecture at the Workshop, please send an applic=
ation consisting of a short abstract (ca. 350 words) and concise CV (max. 1 p=
ag.) to:
Riccardo Macchioro (r.macchioro(a)let.ru.nl<mailto:r.macchioro(a)let.ru.nl>) =
and Gleb Schmidt (gleb.schmidt(a)ru.nl<mailto:gleb.schmidt(a)ru.nl>).
Abstract submission deadline: 10 May 2021. Acceptance will be communicated sh=
ortly after, by 15 May 2021.
Early career scientists and scholars (Ph.D., Post-Doc) are especially encoura=
ged to apply.TOPICS
Three key areas are crucial for the advancement of digital manuscript studies=
: 1) the contribution of research projects with a specific goal to the field =
as a whole; 2) the capacity to expand their (web)application(s) to other disc=
iplines rooted in textual source-material (such as history, philology, cultur=
al studies, and more), and vice-versa; 3) the challenges entailed in developi=
ng and implementing common/universal standards and data models (e.g. for data=
 structuring, storage, and interoperability). Taking into account this overal=
l framework, the main focus of the contributions can be on the scholarly prob=
lems, as well as on the technical issues involved.Possible topics include (without being limited to):Digital approaches to historical phenomena: evaluation of the social impact o=
f a given literary corpus; the reconstruction of disintegrated manuscripts; t=
he digital restoration of dispersed medieval libraries; how digital framework=
s enhance the study of the interaction between the materiality of manuscript =
objects and intellectual concepts like content and organization.Data management, sustainability, interoperability: construction of big reposi=
tories of searchable metadata; the building of shared standards to encode met=
adata on manuscripts; networking, sustainability of structuring standards, in=
teroperability and reusability of the data accumulated.Digital stemmatology: translation of stemmatic principles into reception stud=
ies; approaches to stemmatology from a digital point of view; automatic group=
ing of manuscripts; approaches to overabundant manuscript traditions by means=
 of automatic collation tools.Computational approaches: deep learning and/or machine learning techniques fo=
r computational analysis (script identification, full-text analysis, authorsh=
ip attribution, =E2=80=A6); search for a balance between accuracy, exhaustivi=
ty, and serendipity, while programming and processing computational-statistic=
al analysis; development and employment of OCR transcription tools.Interaction between the machine and the human scholar: harmonization of (digi=
tal) phylogenetics with the exigency of a not (too) mechanic evaluation of th=
e data; strategies to evaluate and classify the results obtained by launching=
 queries on huge amounts of data.Visualization strategies and tools: interpretation of the results of overarch=
ing queries; representation of connections between complex objects such as co=
llections of texts; innovative digital editions.
