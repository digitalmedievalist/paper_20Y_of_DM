If "the whole point" refers to my comment about time, I have to 
disagree, because my time problem is about me, not about the tools. 
Lately I've been running out of the house with my shoes untied because I 
don't have time to tie 'em. But Peter Binkley appears to have addressed 
both the time issue and the one-pass issue. Let us study what he has 
done, and then discuss. My first impression is that Peter Binkley is a 
genius, while I am a rank amateur. My approach was going to be more like 
James Cummings's, though his steps towards a solution look about 100 
times more elegant than what I would do.Peter (Baker)--===============6597218372779368535==--
