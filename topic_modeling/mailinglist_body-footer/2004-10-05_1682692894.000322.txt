Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHello all,
	I need some advice on converting Unicode character references. 
Currently, am encoding character references in what I believe is UCS-4 
format (Universal Character Set). This means they look like this in my 
source files:&#x1090;I want to import xhtml documents into Open Office, which seems to need 
UTF-8 encoding (I don't know what UTF stands for). Does anybody know of 
a filter that might do the conversions for me? Or have advice on using 
open office (Windows version) with UCS-4 encoding?-dan
