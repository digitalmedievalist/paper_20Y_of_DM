feel free to pass this on to other lists and also consider either attending o=

Although there is an injunction delaying the enforcement of recent U.executiv=
e order regarding immigration to the U.S., the organisers of FSCI recognise t=
hat many potential attendees and instructors may have concerns about access a=
nd safety in this and future years. The Force 11 executive has issued two<htt=
ps://www.force11.org/article/force11-statement-restrictions-immigration> stat=
ements<https://www.force11.org/blog/force11-executive-board-statement-restric=
tions-immigration> on the recent immigration ban and is working actively to i=
mprove its ability to respond to and support the needs of people affected by =
these and other restrictions.
Force 11 also has a long and successful track record of funding student atten=
dees and attendees from mid and low income economies to its events. It has se=
veral grant applications under consideration to support future attendance and=
 hopes to be able to continue this support in this and future years.[https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5e2d2ee75f2d3afd1d39a666d/images/2365356e-3102=

 professor emerita. =E2=80=9CLibraries know the current publishing and data r=

they have worked are changing rapidly,=E2=80=9D adds Brian Schottlaender, UCS=

government, industry, funders, and the general public are expecting research =
to be performed, communicated, and measured in new ways. But knowing that thi=

666d&id=3D8e529dd838&e=3D2e694a8dc5> on travel restrictions, there may be que=
stions regarding the location of the Institute in San Diego. The Institute ha=
s been in planning with UCSD for some time and UCSD has committed to providin=
g long-term and substantial financial, administrative, and intellectual suppo=
rt. This support allows us to focus our fundraising on supporting travel for =
those who who would otherwise be unable to attend, which has been a feature o=
f our work in planning FORCE11 meetings for some years. While the current sit=
uation makes this harder, we elected to move forward with the planned locatio=
n. We remain committed to working to mitigate the effects of restrictions to =
travel across the full set of FORCE11 events.Click on the links below if you wish to participate.
