 with the Bentham Project, University College London (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/b=
entham-project/) are coming together to create a FREE game jam, focusing on g=
ames with a purpose (GWAPs).These organisations have experience of crowdsourcing the transcription of his=
torical documents with the assistance of interested volunteers.  They have al=
so been experimenting with the use of Handwritten Text Recognition software t=
o automate the transcription of documents. However, the transcription of hist=
orical material can still be a time-consuming and complex task.The challenge for this Hackathon is to create imaginative and engaging digita=
l games that encourage and help people to transcribe documents efficiently. T=
hese transcriptions will open up access to historical material and make them =
discoverable for anyone interested in historical research.As a team, participants will be invited to create exciting games based on dig=
ital images from a diverse range of historical collections at both The Nation=
al Archives and University College London.The event will include:*         Interesting talks about the documents from archivists and historians*         Briefing on the tasks ahead*         A chance to learn and develop exciting new digital skills*         A showcase of all the work produced over the weekend*         A lot of hacking time*         And of course, pizza!Find out more and register to attend at the Eventbrite page: https://archives=
