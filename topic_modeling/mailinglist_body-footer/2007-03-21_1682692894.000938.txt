Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableFirst of all, do you know of the MLA report on the topic (in part):
http://www.mla.org/pdf/task_force_tenure_promotio.pdf. There was also a
discussion of the issue about a month or so ago on humanist-l. And at
the TEI members meeting last October in Victoria, Stephen Ramsay at the
University of Nebraska discussed what went into the evaluation part of
his new contract in the Digital Humanities there. I'm in the beginning
stages of building a bibliography on the issue (the *very* beginning
stages) so don't have as much to hand as I'd like. But if you troll
Google looking for tenure and electronic resources you come up with some
gems under all the rubbish.There are basically two questions in my view: venue and what is
appropriate work.=20Although I think you are right about electronic journals not really
being an issue, the MLA report a depressing bias against them in tenure
committees in the US. But that will change. A bigger problem in my mind
are the novel forms of publication: self-publication by large and
not-so-large electronic projects, publication in novel types of fora,
such as Wikis, and novel types of work, such as information management.Self-publishing is now extremely common for large electronic
projects--in fact it is the dominant mode, I'd say. Abdullah is right
that many of these have a board as a kind of day-to-day check on their
scholarship, but that is still not a check on large scale questions: by
definition, board members believe in the overall aims and approach of
the project and they are not going to reject a project as unworkable or
not very useful the way a grant reader might. On the other hand, this
situation is not unprecedented: the same issue exists with really large
print projects that have been commissioned by presses.=20I suppose for the really large projects, funding is evidence that they
have been vetted at a fundamental level. But I am reluctant to allow
granting agencies to become the gatekeepers: some projects just don't
apply for funding (my edition of C=C3=A6dmon's Hymn was funded by odds and
ends but refereed the traditional way by a press), and the funding
agencies themselves are having trouble with the whole peer-review
process: the NEH has recently given up asking for outside opinion in
competitions for documentary editions (a group of projects that fit
exactly into this category of "large self-published electronic
projects").I am also not all that sure that boards are really an absolute sine qua
non certification either: first of all, they are not peer-reviewers in
the way that the Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council
(at least) defines them: arms-length reviewers who do not have a close
working relationship with the authors; secondly we don't have any
standard protocols or long standing tradition as to what they are
supposed to do. One board might review material very differently from
another, and we'd never know. And sometimes the granting agencies don't
like them. On our last application for funding for one project, we were
asked to remove their expenses because the readers thought it looked
like a sinecure.Material published in participatory projects like the wikipedia is by
and large unrefereed even when it is refereed: I have a featured article
in the wikipedia on C=C3=A6dmon. It is "peer-reviewed" in the Wikipedia's
sense of the term, but "peer-reviewed" in their sense is not the same as
ours: I'd describe it more as very vigorous copy editing by amateurs of
unequal skill. I'm about to argue in Heroic Age that we need to see
contributions to things like the Wikipedia as a different order of
professional activity--more like the pro bono work of lawyers rather
than billable hours (a draft of the article is here:
http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Research/if-i-were-you-how-academics-=
can-stop-worrying-and-learn-to-love-the-encyclopedia-that-anyone-can-editI think that participation in such projects actually should be rewarded:
it is extremely important to our professional survival, in my opinion,
that we take this work seriously and help improve it. But by and large
this kind of work shouldn't be exclusive: unless somebody's research
programme focusses on the participatory web, I'd say this is like
encyclopedia work or lectures--good evidence of basic activity.The nature of the activity is also an interesting question: in print, we
basically write content and give it to somebody else to format--or let
Word do it. The thing we are judged on is the content; in good digital
work, information design and management is often half the battle.
Marking up a structurally encoded edition is not the same as
typesetting: there are significant intellectual decisions to be made. It
took me six months work to figure out what an apparatus was in
structural and database terms before I could properly encode the
apparatus in my edition of C=C3=A6dmon's Hymn, for example, and projects face
many of these decisions--usually smaller--on a daily basis.Fortunately there are increasingly fora for publishing the results of
this kind of research--DM was set up precisely to provide one--but there
are people who tend to specialise in this hidden kind of work in much
the same way you have experimental scientists who build the machines for
others' experiments. If I understood Stephen Ramsey's talk aright, his
contract includes a system for reviewing and rewarding this kind of
work. But it is still uncommon. Maybe we need to look more at how the
experimental scientists and computer scientists do it.So what do you do if you are faced with Jerome McGann's Rossetti
Archive? I guess it has to be evaluated on its own terms--maybe for
important career milestones departments need to bring in their own
reviewers.
