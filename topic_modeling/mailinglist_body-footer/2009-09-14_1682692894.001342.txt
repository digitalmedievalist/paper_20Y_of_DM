out just as I expected, with the  clear majority of those answering
saying that their CMS was something like "Some CMS staff, but mostly
co-opted faculty from other humanities departments".Does anyone know of any real surveys of this type of thing? Perhaps by the MA=
A?Thanks again,-James Cummings
