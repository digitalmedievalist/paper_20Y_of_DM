slightly different from collaborative editing) is all about adhering
to mutually agreed conventions of collaborative transcription.A good model for this is the Distributed Proofreaders that
crowdsources correction of dirty OCR for project gutenberg. If I'm not
mistaken there is per volume a responsible person who checks things
and is responsible for any specialised guidelines, anyone is allowed
to go and proofread a few pages depending on the perceived level of
difficulty of the volume.  As you proofread more you graduate to being
allowed to do volumes with a higher level of perceived difficulty, and
presumably eventually oversee volumes.I feel that kind of graduated  responsibility in crowdsourcing
techniques is probably a good idea.  But it all comes down to the
guidelines for the average user being clear and easy to understand, or
them being able to flag potential problems easily.With collaborative editing, then there are lots of models with
slightly different methodologies and technologies.  I, of course,
agree with Dot and Dan that XML as a preservation format is pretty
much a requirement these days.  And with Dot that medievalists can
learn (and in my experience quite frequently are learning) TEI XML
quite quickly.  After all as medievalists we do things like learn
skills like palaeography and languages like medieval Latin, nevermind
all the other things, so by comparison to learn a human-readable
markup format is really a lot easier than most of the things we do.-JamesOn Mon, Jul 27, 2009 at 22:47, Dot Porter<dot.porter(a)gmail.com> wrote:
