  *   Growing a Research Network: Approaches to Global Book HistorySuzanne Conklin Akbari, Institute for Advanced Study, and Alexandra Gillespie=
, University of TorontoFriday, October 15, 2021, 12:00 - 1:30 pm EDT (via Zoom)The Book and the Silk Roads approaches the "book" in a capacious way: it is a=
 writing surface, taken from the natural world, hand-crafted to bear textual =
records. Books can be rolls, leaves, screenfolds, codices, tablets, and even =
standing stones. To reveal their meanings, to read their diverse texts and sc=
ripts alongside their materials, physical structures, and layers of accretion=
s, we need to marshal innovative, interdisciplinary approaches and a collabor=
ative methodology, embedded within a global perspective. Over the past year a=
nd a half, we have worked to transform our understanding of the human past an=
d its nonhuman contexts by establishing a wide range of research partnerships=
, laying the groundwork for a global history of the book. In this talk, we wi=
ll offer an overview of The Book and the Silk Roads that 1) summarizes the le=
ssons learned during the pandemic, as our project has pivoted in a nimble way=
 to accommodate increased use of online environments and limitations on resea=
rch travel; 2) outlines some of our research findings, from birchbark Kashmir=
i manuscripts to palimpsests from Sinai; and 3) describes our increasingly su=
bstantial public humanities focus, including our upcoming exhibition at the A=
ga Khan Museum, Hidden Stories: Books Along the Silk Roads. Click here for mo=
