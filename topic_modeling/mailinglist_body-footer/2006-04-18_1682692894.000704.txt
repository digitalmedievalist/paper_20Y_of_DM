permission to use it is to contact the editor and most likely the 
publisher.  The editor *may* have copyright in the work, but may have 
signed away all his rights to the publisher.  Additionally, the 
publisher will have copyright in that particular published edition for 
25 years.  (I.e. its arrangement, divisions, where pagebreaks fall, 
choice of typeface, etc.)  Don't even ask about photographs...
http://www.intellectual-property.gov.uk/  has some more information 
about the UK, if that is of any help.  But basically, ignore the state 
of the material before it was edited, article 5 probably does not 
apply,  given that the editor is still alive, it will probably be 
under copyright until 70 years after his death. He may not own this 
copyright though and the publish may be willing to licence it to you 
given its age if they do not think they'll be losing money.As Peter also notes, I'm not a lawyer and this is not official legal 
advice.-James
