DHOxSS Peer-Reviewed Poster Session: Call for Posters
Deadline: 1 May 2014
http://dhoxss.humanities.ox.ac.uk/2014/posters.htmlDigital Humanities at Oxford Summer School (DHOxSS) is one of the leading
international training events in Digital Humanities. It is for researchers,
project managers, librarians, research assistants, students, and anyone
interested in Digital Humanities. DHOxSS delegates are introduced to a
range of topics including the creation, management, analysis, modelling,
visualization, or publication of digital data in the humanities. Each
delegate follows one of our five-day workshops and supplements this with
additional morning parallel lectures. There will also be a peer-reviewed
poster session giving delegates a chance to present their Digital
Humanities work to those at the DHOxSS. Presenting a poster often gives
delegates a chance to receive funding to attend from their local
institution.This year's DHOxSS will be held on 14-18 July 2014 and the five-day
workshops offered are:1. Introduction to Digital Humanities
2. Taking Control: Practical Scripting for Digital Humanities Projects
3. Data Curation and Access for the Digital Humanities
4. A Humanities Web of Data: Publishing, Linking and Querying on the
Semantic Web
5. Using the Text Encoding Initiative for Digital Scholarly EditionsThe Monday evening reception at the Oxford University Museum of Natural
History also will be our peer-reviewed poster session. The poster
application form asks for an abstract (max 250 words) of what your poster
is about and why it will be useful for delegates at DHOxSS 2014 to see it.
Only registered delegates of DHOxSS, or members of the University of
Oxford, may present a research poster at DHOxSS. However, you do not need
to be registered at the time of submitting the poster application form.The DHOxSS will offer an excellent opportunity to gain knowledge and
participate in discussions about a wide range of digital techniques and
research methods, as well as exploring key topics in depth with leading
senior researchers and technologists.Applications are due by 1 May 2014. For more information see:
http://dhoxss.humanities.ox.ac.uk/2014/posters.html and for enquiries email
researchsupport(a)it.ox.ac.uk.Donâ€™t forget our NeDiMAH bursaries, deadline fast approaching: 22 April
2014.
