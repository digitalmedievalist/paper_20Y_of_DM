had Gospels from 1956. These slides were taken a few years prior to the St Ch=
ad Gospels' pages flattened and the manuscript rebound by Roger Powell in 196=
2, providing rare information about the effects of such flattening efforts on=
 pigments : https://lichfield.as.uky.edu/st-chad-gospels/historical-image-ove=
rlays .Of particular interests are areas of minimal pigment loss in the left border =
on the Cross-Carpet page (its left), lower right portion of Luke's robe on hi=
s portrait page, and the decoration on the last row of words of Luke's incipi=
t.Best,
Bill
