This workshop is the third in a series where the main objective is to get a b=
etter understanding of the dynamics on the Digital Humanities work floor wher=
e humanities scholars and digital experts meet and work in tandem to solve hu=
manities research questions. The best way to do this seems to be to give both=
 parties the opportunity to present their achievements and to share their col=
laboration experiences with the audience. The insights gained should help tho=
se involved in the education of humanities scholars, professionals and techni=
cal experts alike to develop better training programmes.As the problem of cross-discipline collaboration is not new we also invite th=
ose who have relevant experience or interesting ideas about how to address th=
is in university or other curricula to share their ideas with the audience.In earlier workshops talks were submitted and presented by a humanities resea=
rcher and a digital expert (the Twin Talks). They were asked to report on on-=
going or recently completed research
carried out together, both from their individual perspective (either humaniti=
es research or technical), as well as on their collaboration experience. Rece=
ntly we added the talks by people
with experience or interesting ideas about how cross-discipline collaboration=
 is or can be addressed in curricula or other training activities (the Teach =
Talks).The workshops were typically scheduled as full-day workshops, starting with a=
n invited talk, followed by a number of 20-30 minutes presentations, and conc=
luded with a round table discussion with all participants.About the Twin Talks workshop at DH2020

Due to the coronavirus the DH2020 conference will go virtual, and so will the=
 Twin Talks 3 workshop. This has consequences for the format.The duration of the virtual workshop will be 2 hours, and it will have an int=
eractive, panel-like format, with short pitches (duration dependent on number=
 of accepted talks). The Twin Talk pitches should briefly describe (i) the re=
search problem addressed, (ii) its solution, including the technical aspects,=
 (iii) a report on the collaboration experience itself, including obstacles e=
ncountered and (iv) recommendations how better training and education could h=
elp to make collaboration more efficient and effective.The Teach Talks should briefly describe (i) the collaboration settings on whi=
ch they are based, (ii) the approach adopted, and (iii) recommendations.After the talks there will be a discussion with all participants to formulate=
 the lessons learned from the presentations, and to identify further steps th=
at could be taken.Research and teaching topics
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D
All humanities research topics in a very broad sense are welcome, where we ex=
plicitly include social sciences and cultural heritage studies. Research or t=
eaching activities may be completed or
ongoing, as long as the presentation explicitly addresses the way the humanit=
ies researcher and the digital expert have collaborated or still collaborate.Why should you submit and/or attend?
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Humanities research can only benefit maximally from new developments in techn=
ology if content and digital experts team up, very similar to the hard scienc=
es where research is done in teams working on a specific problem, where every=
body brings in his/her specific content and technical expertise and skills.Co-design, co-development and co-creation are the rule rather than the except=
ion, but very little is known about how this collaboration works in practice =
and how better training and education of both humanities scholars and digital=
 experts could facilitate the way they collaborate.This is what this workshop wants to address, based on real life collaboration=
 examples. We especially invite researchers, professionals, educators, and RI=
 operators with a special interest in creating the conditions where humanitie=
s scholars and technical experts can fruitfully collaborate in answering huma=
nities research questions.Submission instructions
