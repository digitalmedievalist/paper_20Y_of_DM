edievalist, which is now available online from the DM-website: http://www.dig=
italmedievalist.org/journal.This issue features the proceedings of the 2010 MARGOT conference as a specia=
l cluster guest-edited by Christine McWebb: twelve articles illustrating the =
wide range of aspects of our field at the intersection of digital scholarship=
 and medieval studies. This is our first special cluster and is published alo=
ng side the normal type of articles and reviews published by DM.I would like to express my appreciation to the contributors of this issue, to=
 guest-editor Christine McWebb, the referees, and to all volunteers who suppo=
rted the publication.And as always: Digital Medievalist is a peer-reviewed online journal in open =
access (CC BY NC). Please consider your contribution to the community and con=
tact us at editors(a)digitalmedievalist.org. We have already started working =
on the next issue!Enjoy reading!On behalf of the editorial team (Peter Stokes, Dan O'Donnell, and Rebecca Wel=
