Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableFollowing on from Rebecca's recommendation - assuming the student is
interested particularly in a program that would allow focus on
manuscript digitization I would suggest library/information school,
particularly one with a focus on preservation, archives, and/or rare
books partnered with a university library that has an active
digitization program. UNC-Chapel Hill (my alma mater) comes to mind,
as does IUB (where I work now), but I'm sure there are others.Another option is to look for universities not (only) with active
library digitization programs, but with computer science (or other
engineering departments) with a focus on cultural heritage
digitization. The experience gained there would be less
straightforward digital scanning and photography and more advanced
imaging, perhaps 3D scanning (with a computer science focus). The
University of Kentucky (where I used to work)[1] has a library school
that is not known for being particularly digitally-focused, but there
is both an active preservation and digitization program in the library
and the advanced imaging work happening in the Center for
Visualization and Virtual Environments. I would expect you could build
some program as well at University College London (which also has a
digital humanities center) - if your student would be interested in
moving to England for a time. Education and experience in advanced
imaging partnered with serious manuscripts study would be, I think,
immensely valuable.UIUC also has an iSchool plus a digital humanities center plus an
active program in advanced imaging of cultural heritage objects.There are a lot of options, it really depends on where she wants to focus.Dot[1] I'm really not being pushy, I'm just going with what I know!On Fri, Mar 25, 2011 at 8:38 AM, Welzenbach, Rebecca <rwelzenb(a)umich.edu> w=
