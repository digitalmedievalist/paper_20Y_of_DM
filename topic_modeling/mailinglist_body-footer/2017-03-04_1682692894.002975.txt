**5:30 Wednesday 8th March**
**Room 132, first floor, Foster Court, UCL, Malet Place, LONDON, WC1E 7JE *CIRCSE 
<http://centridiricerca.unicatt.it/circse-home?rdeLocaleAttr=en>is a 
pluri- and interdisciplinary research centre at the Università Cattolica 
del Sacro Cuore <http://www.ucsc.it/>(Milan, Italy). The main research 
interests of the centre are in the field of natural language processing 
and information extraction from written language texts in electronic 
form. Originally founded by padre Roberto Busa, pioneer of computational 
linguistics on Latin textual material, the centre now hosts the Index 
Thomisticus Treebank <http://itreebank.marginalia.it/>, and other 
resources connected to it, and the morphological analyser and lemmatiser 
LEMLAT <http://www.ilc.cnr.it/lemlat/lemlat/index.html>, together with 
its brand-new spin-off, the Word Formation Latin (WFL) 
<http://wfl.marginalia.it/> lexicon.Word Formation Latin is a derivational morphology resource for Latin 
that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 
research and innovation programme, under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie 
grant agreement No 658332-WFL. The contents of WFL are lexical items 
(lemmas) related on the basis of word formation rules (WFRs). For 
example, lemmas amo (‘to love) and amator (‘lover’) are connected by a 
relationship that describes a change from a verb to a noun through the 
addition of a suffix that in itself bears semantic information: agent 
and instrumental suffix -tor.The seminar will give a brief tour of what goes on in Milan before 
looking in more detail at how derivational morphology information can be 
crucial for the enrichment of NLP resources for Latin, how the WFL 
lexicon came to be, what it looks like, and how scholars and enthusiasts 
of Latin can use it for their research.All welcome and there will be drinks and discussion after the talk. 
Please note that registration 
<https://ucldhseminarlitta.eventbrite.co.uk> is required.
      SpeakerEleonora Litta <http://docenti.unicatt.it/ita/eleonora_maria_litta/> has 
an MA in Medieval Studies from University College London, and a PhD in 
Classics and Latin Philology at King's College London. Her interests lie 
especially in historical linguistics, Classics and Germanic Philology, 
with special emphasis on the development of digital language resources, 
text analysis, corpus linguistics and computational linguistics. She 
worked for seven years as a lead analyst at the Department of Digital 
Humanities, King’s College London, before being awarded a Marie 
Skłodowska-Curie Research fellowship to develop a new digital resource 
for Latin, at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, Italy.
