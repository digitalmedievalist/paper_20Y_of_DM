The Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies is excited to announce the fi=
rst lecture in this fall's SIMS Online Lecture Series. We kick off with the d=
ynamic rock star duo, Dot Porter and Lisa Fagin Davis. See details below.Friday, September 16, 2022, 12:00 - 1:30 pm EDT
Medieval Rolls in a Digital Environment
Dot Porter, Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies, Penn Libraries, and =
Lisa Fagin Davis, Medieval Academy of AmericaMedieval rolls are notoriously difficult to display and publish. Digital publ=
ishing tends to focus on codex books, and to function at the level of the tur=
ning page. The physical format of rolls - membranes of parchment stitched tog=
ether to form a long and narrow strip, which could be dozens of feet long - d=
efies these expectations; other options are needed to effectively edit and pu=
blish medieval rolls in a way that respects their physical format and doesn't=
 force them into a framework designed for books. Digital Mappa (DM) is one of=
 these options. Originally designed for the editing of medieval maps of the w=
orld, DM centers the image and enables the annotation and linking of both ima=
ges and text. DM is particularly useful for the editing of rolls, as the two =
examples in this lecture will illustrate.In this lecture, Dr Lisa Fagin Davis, professor of practice in manuscript stu=
dies at the Simmons Graduate School of Library and Information Science and ex=
ecutive director of the Medieval Academy of America, will present on the Digi=
tal Chronique 2.0, a DM edition of the Chronique Anonyme Universelle, a lavis=
hly illustrated scroll history of the world from Creation to the fifteenth ce=
ntury. Dot Porter, SIMS founding member and Curator of Digital Research Servi=
ces, will present on Ms. Roll 1066: Genealogical Chronicle of the Kings of En=
gland to Edward IV, circa 1461, originally published online in 2012 and repub=
lished in DM earlier this year.To register for the zoom link, click here<https://libcal.library.upenn.edu/ca=
