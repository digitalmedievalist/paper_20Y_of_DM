The Medieval Academy's Committee on Electronic Resources is concerned by 
this very issue.  We feel that at the minimum graduate students need an 
introduction to humanities computing.  We would like to promote study at 
an even deeper level through course concentration at the Master's level. 
 We recognize the importance of computing skills as a basic research 
method.  
We are currently working with CARA (Committee on Centers and Regional 
Associations) in order to survey their membership to see what the 
current state of humanities computing curriculum in medieval studies 
programs is.  We hope to create a directory highlighting those programs 
that have some computing program and the nature of those programs.  We 
also hope to make recommendations based upon this survey to effect its 
inclusion in medievla studies curriculum.
thanks,
PattiPatricia Kosco Cossard, M.A., M.L.S.
