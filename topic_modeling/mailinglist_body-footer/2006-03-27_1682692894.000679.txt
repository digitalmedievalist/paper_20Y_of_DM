There are actually two different spaces where people may contribute. 
Text annotation using the annotation engine, which will show notes
"within" texts, is more for established scholars with accounts that we
give them from our end.  So they can't self-register; but if they're
interested and qualified, they (you!) are welcome to request an
annotation account.  We haven't refused anyone yet; it's been a pretty
self-selecting group.However, there's also a discussion forum, intended mostly for
verification work on the (long and rather involved) indexes that we've
put up, but any other relevant discussion as well.  The forum requires
registration as well, but people can do it themselves and of course
for free.Some have already registered, although things are a bit slow in
starting.  We're not losing hope, though, and in the meantime are
catching and (hopefully) squashing bugs.  :)We'll see if this dual system -- one open space, one not-so-open space
-- will work.-Vika--
