event taking place this year on 8 - 12 July 2013 at the University of
Oxford for researchers, project managers, research assistants, and students
of Digital Humanities. DHOXSS delegates are introduced to a range of topics
including the creation, management, analysis, modelling, visualization, or
publication of digital data for the humanities. Each delegate follows one
of our 5-day workshops and supplements this with guest lectures by experts
in their fields.This year's main workshops include:1. Cultural Connections: exchanging knowledge and widening participation in
the Humanities
2. How to do Digital Humanities: Discovery, Analysis and Collaboration
3. A Humanities Web of Data: publishing, linking and querying on the
semantic web.
4. An Introduction to XML and the Text Encoding Initiative
5. An Introduction to XSLT for Digital HumanistsThere are a variety of evening events including a peer-reviewed poster
session to give delegates a chance to demonstrate their work to the other
delegates and speakers. The Thursday evening sees an elegant drinks
reception and three-course banquet at the historic Queen's College Oxford.DHOXSS is a collaboration for Digital.Humanities(a)Oxford between the
University of Oxford's IT Services, the Oxford e-Research Centre (OeRC),
the Bodleian Libraries, and The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities.Questions: email courses(a)it.ox.ac.uk for answers.James Cummings
