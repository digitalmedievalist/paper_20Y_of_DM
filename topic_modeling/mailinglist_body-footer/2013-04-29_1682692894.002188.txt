led by Dot Porter and Tim Stinson, at the International Congress on
Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo, MI. The workshop is scheduled for Friday,
May 10, 10am, Waldo Library Classroom A. This room is a computer lab. No
registration is required, just come if you are interested in learning more
about MESA.Wat is MESA? Funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, MESA is a federated
international community of scholars, projects, institutions, and
organizations engaged in digital scholarship within the field of medieval
studies. MESA seeks both to provide a community for those engaged in
digital medieval studies and to meet emerging needs of this community,
including making recommendations on technological and scholarly standards
for electronic scholarship, the aggregation of data, and the ability to
discover and repurpose this data. MESA is also a website, providing a
federated search across digital medieval projects and collections. This
workshop will focus on the use of the website (which is set to launch
publicly in early Summer).In this workshop, we'll do three things:First, we'll demonstrate MESA's functionality and use. This w=
ill answer the
most basic question: What is MESA, and what can it be used for? This part
of the workshop will be useful both for a generally interested audience of
scholars, and for individuals and groups who may be interested in having
their projects in MESA.Next, we'll practice using MESA for research purposes. This will be t=
he
most hands-on part of the workshop, and we encourage participants to come
ready to search, comment, and perhaps even to start to build scholarship in
the workshop.Finally, we'll present background on how federating projects into MESA
actually works. This part of the workshop is aimed particularly at
individuals and groups who may be interested in having their projects in
MESA, although others may be interested to learn about the process. This
will involve some technical discussion and in-workshop coding examples.
Workshop attendees representing projects are invited to bring project
metadata with them, and we will work on extracting the RDF metadata
required by MESA during the workshop. If you are interested in having your
project used as an in-workshop example, please email
dot.porter(a)gmail.comto express interest.To read more about MESA, please visit our blog:
