of its public blog and informational site:http://tileproject.orgOur first blog posting includes a description of anticipated TILE
functionality.http://mith.info/tile/2009/07/20/welcome/Upcoming posts will include an invitation to participate in user
testing, as well as announcements of software as it becomes available.Visit often, or subscribe to the RSS feed for the latest news on TILE.http://mith.info/tile/feed/TILE is a collaborative project between the Maryland Institute for
Technology in the Humanities (MITH), Digital Humanities Observatory
(DHO), and Indiana University Bloomington, funded through a major
grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities Preservation and
Access: Humanities Collections and Resources program (research and
development focus). Over two years TILE will develop a new web-based,
modular, collaborative image markup tool for both manual and
semi-automated linking between encoded text and image of text, and
image annotation.The project is unusual in digital humanities tools development in that
it is being designed from the start to support a wide variety of use
cases. Several projects from the University of Indiana Bloomington,
The University of Oregon and Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies are
initial testbeds. In the second year of the project, TILE will turn to
the user community for testing. If you are interested in
participating, or in learning more about the project, please contact
us at TILEPROJECT(a)listserv.heanet.ie.--
