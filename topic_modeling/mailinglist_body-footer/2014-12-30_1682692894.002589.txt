workers have any interest in this sort of work outside of the job itself then=
 any time they may spend to become comfortable with these powerful tools will=
 not be wasted.That said, as noted, Dropbox does offer access to file version history and re=
storation of deleted files and folders, so that might be enough for your purp=
oses. In my experience it often doesn't handle simultaneous users of =
shared files very elegantly, so there is need for caution if that will be a c=
ommon scenario.  Google Drive is much better in this regard, but it's=
 not as flexible with respect to file types.Josh--
