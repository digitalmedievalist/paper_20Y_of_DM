Fetzer 1035On Thursday, May 7th, 2009 at 6:30pm, Digital Medievalist (DM) and the
Medieval Academy of Americaâ€™s Committee on Electronic Resources (CER)
and Electronic Editions Advisory Board (EEAB) will be co-sponsoring a
reception. This reception is an ideal opportunity for speakers and
audience members participating in the more than 40 digital sessions at
this year's congress to meet and learn about each other's research.To assist in this networking and community-building, a number of
medievalists engaged in digital-based or focussed research will be
displaying posters and short powerpoint presentations during the
reception. This will be a forum for speakers to give potential
audience members an advance taste of what they will be lecturing
about, and for speakers who have already presented to remind
colleagues about your research and projects and invite further
comment.We hope to see you at the reception and poster session, which will be
held in Fetzer 1035 at 6:30 PM on Thursday.--
