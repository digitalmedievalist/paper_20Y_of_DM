databases, never mind any with Z39.50 built-in. However, have a look at
http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/bib/openbib.html
http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/
http://www.theresearcher.ca/index.htmlAnd finally, "A Tool for Bibliography Management and Sharing: The ShaRef
Project" http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september04/09inbrief.html#WILDEI use Endnote which is proprietary but supports Z39.50. The latest version
can export bibliographies in XML which is again proprietary and can
not be modified as far as I can see, but well-structured and sensible.Elizabeth

> Hello all,
>     I use Procite (<http://www.procite.com/> to keep my bibliography,
> mostly because it has a good Z39.5 client. Z39.50
> <http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/> is an international standard used by
> many libraries (though not the Royal Dutch Library, duizend
> bliksembommen!)  for data interchange. In the case of procite, what this
> means is that I can download book information, including call numbers  and
> subject fields directly from various libraries. Amongst other  things, it
> has made it quite easy to rearrange my personal library using  LoC call
> numbers (not a perfect system, of course, but since it comes  ready made,
> I can't complain).
>
>     Anyway, I want now to built an on-line catalogue of my stuff, so I
> can check if I own something when I am in a foreign library. Originally,
> I was just going to dumpt the procite format to a database (it is built
> on a 45 field database) and use PHP and MySQL to built a simple front
> end. But then I began to wonder if perhaps an open source system already
> existed. Does anybody know of one? Basically what I need is a robust
> bibliographic database with a Z39.50 client built in.
