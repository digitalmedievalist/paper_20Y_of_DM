Digital Transformations of Research and Styles of KnowingRalph Schroeder, Senior Research Fellow, Oxford Internet InstituteEric T. Meyer, Research Fellow, Oxford Internet InstituteTuesday 17 January, 6.15pm, Anatomy Museum. Followed by drinks
In recent years, large-scale research programmes have been implemented=20
across the globe with labels like e-Science, e-Infrastructure and=20
cyberinfrastructure (Meyer and Schroeder 2009). It has been argued that=20
these various digital transformations have fundamentally changed how=20
research is done. In this paper, we challenge this argument, and suggest=20
instead that there are more specific changes in particular areas of=20
research that have taken place. To delimit the scope of what can be=20
considered a digital transformation of research or =E2=80=98e-Research=E2=80=
=99 (since=20
these could potentially encompass a vast range of phenomena), we define=20
these as the distributed and collaborative use of digital tools and data=20
in the production of scientific knowledge. One feature that e-Research=20
efforts share is that they consist of online research technologies with=20
a digital component, though what this component consists of varies among=20
particular e-Research projects (for example, data in a digital format,=20
the use of computing power to perform processing, or the creation of=20
complex visualizations with computer graphics). We argue, however, that=20
this variety in technologies is not infinite, but that there are a=20
limited number of these components which can be identified.Please register to attend at: http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2658460527About the speakersDr Eric T. Meyer is a Research Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute.=20
His research in the area of social informatics focuses on understanding=20
how digital technologies enable changes in the way people work, relate=20
and interact. A particular focus has been studying how the practices of=20
research are changing as digital tools and data become central in the=20
sciences, social sciences, and arts & humanities. He is broadly=20
interested in a fundamental question regarding how technology and=20
practice are related: what evidence is there that technology has enabled=20
people and organizations to do entirely new things? More information is=20

University of Oxford. He is director of research at the Institute and=20
director of its Master's degree in 'Social Science of the Internet'. His=20
books include 'Rethinking Science, Technology and Social Change'=20
