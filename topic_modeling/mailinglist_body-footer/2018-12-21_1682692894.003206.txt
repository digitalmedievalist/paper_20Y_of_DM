This two-day symposium aims to bring together scholars and researchers workin=
g with computational approaches to texts. The event targets a broad audience =
interested in the application of digital text analysis technology, as text mi=
ning, topic modeling, authorship detection, writing style analysis, text reus=
e, or more generally tasks performed through Natural Language Processing (NLP=
). These techniques have significant potential not only for the study of lite=
rature but also for the study of texts and language in general. The symposium=
 aims to create an open forum for showcasing these techniques.The event is also grounded in the idea that computational text analysis shoul=
d be integrated not only in the academic research by faculty and their PhD st=
udents, but also in a pedagogical environment. The use of computational analy=
sis opens up new questions in literary studies, and exposes students to many =
different ways of thinking about literature today.Computer-aided literary studies still thus tend to be focused on literatures =
written in modern languages. NLP tools are quite developed for modern languag=
es, especially for the modern English language. For medieval and premodern la=
nguages, due to their instability of orthographic forms, attempts to conduct =
computer-aided (thus, to a degree, systematic) research face many challenges =
to normalize and standardize their linguistic forms. Therefore, the symposium=
 also aims to explore the use and challenge of using NLP tools for studying l=
iteratures written in underrepresented and historical languages, such as the =
medieval and premodern variants and precursors of Spanish, French, Latin, and=
 Dutch. Therefore, a special focus will be on the preprocessing  routines ava=
ilable for these texts, such as lemmatization, by which we collect inflected =
forms under a single item or lemma, as well as challenges faced normalizing o=
rthographic variation of historical texts and other languages with unstable o=
rthographies. Among the international and national speakers we will have seve=
ral experts on the topic.Our envisioned program for the symposium is as follows: On the first day, the=
re will be several workshops, including one devoted to integrating computer-a=
ssisted analysis in the classroom, which will offer an introduction to stylom=
etry, visualization, and text-reuse. On the second day, there will be talks (=
30 min) that present ongoing research projects, methodologies, and challenges=
. The subject languages are preferably, but not limited to underrepresented a=
nd historical languages.
							=09
We are specifically interested in receiving proposals for contributions on on=
e or more of the following topics:=20Stylometry for authorship studies
Stylometry as an approach to literary study
Natural Language Processing and linguistic annotation
Lemmatizers for underrepresented modern languages and old languages=20
Text reuse detection
Normalization
Distributional semantics
Network analysis
Text visualization=20We especially welcome contributions from those working with any type of textu=
al corpora, preferably those conceived for a specific research and/ from a di=
achronic perspective. We conceive this symposium as an opportunity to share (=
best)-practices and broaden conversation, thus proposals can be on ongoing an=
d experimental methodologies.=20Confirmed Speakers:=20
