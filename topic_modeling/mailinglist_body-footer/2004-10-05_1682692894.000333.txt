abstract character in Unicode, is not the Greek upper-case Omega abstract 
character in UCS-4? In other words, that the 937 code point refers to 
different abstract characters in Unicode vs. UCS, that the two standards 
map the same code point to different characters? If so, it appears (to me, 
at least) to be a very bad design choice; conversion would certainly be 
needed in this case. If not, then UCS &#937 is exactly the same as Unicode 
&#937, and no conversion of the entity coding is needed.There must be a character chart somewhere comparing UCS and Unicode code 
points...>"Fonts" are again from a different level of abstraction.  A font is a set

some other glyph there, you would not see the Greek upper-case Omega with 
that font. My badly-stated point was that while the entity &#937 always 
means the Greek upper-case Omega abstract character in the Unicode 
standard, the glyph you actually see depends on the font in use. A 
Unicode-compliant font should show the Omega glyph, but whether it does or 
not is up to the font creator.DavidDavid Badkehttp://badke.ca/david
