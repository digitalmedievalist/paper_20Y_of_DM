*Digitizing the Medieval Archive*An International ConferenceCentre for Medieval Studies – University of Toronto *–* April 25/26, 2014*David Greetham (The Graduate Center, CUNY)**Stephen G. Nichols (Johns Hopkins University)**Caroline Mac**é (KU Leuven)**Consuelo Dutschke (Columbia University Library)*Discussion about the digitization of archival fonds and library holdings 
pertaining to the Middle Ages boasts a wide profusion both in online 
settings and in real time. As the question of how medievalists may work 
within this digital environment becomes an increasingly more widely 
discussed topic, we invite scholars in the Humanities and Social 
Sciences to convene in Toronto to consider and discuss the possibilities 
of the digitized medieval archive.There has been and continues to be considerable variation in the 
introduction, evaluation and continuation of digital storage. Digital 
technology has expanded and complicated the idea of the medieval 
archive. In bringing together the two concepts, digitization and 
archivization, we aim to address questions about the dissemination of 
and access to materials and research, but also such long-standing 
questions relating to the methodological and practical ways we carry out 
research and think about our material – thinking digitally about the 
Middle Ages.This conference sets out to explore ways in which medievalists might 
harness the vast, digital possibilities for a cross-institutional and 
interdisciplinary medieval archive. Possible topics may include but are 
not limited to the following:Implications of digital archives for the editing of medieval textsMethodologies and/or ideologies behind archivizationThe archivization of already existing digital databasesDigitized archives/collections as enabling or limiting researchThe digital (re)construction of medieval collectionsCompilation and order of medieval textsTextual forms / reading methodsFluidity of the medieval text and the InternetThe digital conglomeration of visual and narrative dataDigital visualization of medieval documents, art and literaturePlease submit a short C.V. and abstracts of *250 words *by *November 1, 
2013*for consideration.digitizingmedievalarchive(a)gmail.comdigitizingmedievalarchive.wordpress.com
