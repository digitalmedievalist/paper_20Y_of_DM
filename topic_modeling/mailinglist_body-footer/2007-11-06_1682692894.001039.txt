To: TEI-L(a)listserv.brown.eduDear TEI users,After more than 6 years of, at times quite intensive, development, it is
with great pleasure that I announce the release of version 1.0 of P5, the
latest and greatest version of the Guidelines of the Text Encoding
Initiative, which officially happened Nov. 2 at the TEI Members Meeting in
Maryland.  You will find the new version online at
http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html; a PDF and
even printed books are expected to appear in due time.The main development work has been carried out by the TEI Technical Council
and the Editors Lou Burnard and Syd Bauman.  I would like to take this
opportunity to warmly thank all previous members of the Council but also
especially the current members, who shared quite a big of the work, which
magically increased as the release date was approaching:David Birnbaum, Tone Merete Bruvik, Arianna Ciula, James Cummings, Matthew
Driscoll, Daniel O'Donnel, Dot Porter, Sebastian Rahtz Laurent Romary, Conal
Tuohy, John Walsh.Christian WitternChair, TEI Technical Council
