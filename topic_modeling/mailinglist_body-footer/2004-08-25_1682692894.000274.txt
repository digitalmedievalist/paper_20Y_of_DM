Subject: Voynich MS article in Wired (TAN?)

114, 116, 121) on Gordon Rugg's de-bunking of the Voynich MS. The
Wired article focuses on his methodology, not the MS, but it mentions
his article on the MS in the journal _Cryptologia_  published earlier
this year. I think medieval studies folks will be interested in the
Wired article discussion of his method -- "the verifier approach"  --
used for problem solving and examining "expertise gaps" as well as
the article on the MS.---Amy West--
