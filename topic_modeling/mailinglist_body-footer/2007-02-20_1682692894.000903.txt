executive board. Per the Digital Medievalist Bylaws, Board members
will be expected to serve the DM membership by serving on an editorial
committee responsible for the production of the DM journal, overseeing
the operation of the DM wiki, moderating the dm-l listserv, and/or
organizing conference and poster sessions on behalf of Digital
Medievalist. Board members serve two-year terms, with four spaces
available each year.Eligibility to run for the board is determined by "demonstrable
contribution to the project within the previous year," although there
is no precise definition of a "demonstrable contribution." This
might include editing the DM wiki, publishing an article or review in
the DM Journal, or participating in a DM-sponsored session. Anyone who
is subscribed to the Digital Medievalist listserv is eligible to vote.If you would like to nominate yourself or someone else, please send a
brief biographical statement (max 200 words) to Dot Porter at
dot.porter(a)gmail.com.For more information on the Digital Medievalist and the DM Board,
please refer to the Bylaws:http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/BylawsNominations will be accepted through March 14, at which point the slate
will be announced and biographies will be sent to the DM Listserv and
posted to the DM website. Voting will be held by email from March 21
through March 25. March 25 is Lady Day, the Feast of the Annunciation,
and was New Year's Day until 1752, when western dating moved from the
Julian Calendar to the Gregorian Calendar. It is thus a suitable day
to welcome the new Digital Medievalist board members.--
