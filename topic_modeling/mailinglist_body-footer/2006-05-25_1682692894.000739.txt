the list rather than simply a link: if you are in the U.K. this summer,
you may well want to check out the Work in Progress seminar: really some
superb topics there, and despite the focus on classics, of immediate
interest to medievalists as well.Are any medievalists using GPS, Google earth, and the like in their
digital projects?-d
