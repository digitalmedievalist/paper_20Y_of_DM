         Subject: CCH studentship for the PhD in Digital HumanitiesThe Centre for Computing in the Humanities,
King's College London, is very pleased to
announce the availability of a studentship for
its PhD in Digital Humanities, to commence
October 2006. Applications must be received by 7
April, so almost immediate action is required. If
you know someone who might be interested, please
see that he or she receives a copy of this
message as soon as possible.Application is a two-stage process, as follows:1. Candidates must first commence application to
the PhD in Digital Humanities. This may be done
online. See
http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/humanities/cch/pg/apply.html
for information and the form.2. They must then apply for the Studentship
itself. See
http://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/gsstdship.html for information and the
form.The studentships will provide funding for a
minimum of three years, subject to satisfactory
progress, to cover tuition fees at the home level
and a stipend of 14,300 GBP for the first year,
increasing in line with national stipend levels in subsequent years.All applications received will be acknowledged
and candidates will be notified of the College's
decision by early May 2006.The CCH would appreciate a brief note of intent
to apply, to Sarah Davenport, sarah dot davenport
at kcl dot ac dot uk. (Confirmation of receipt
will be sent.) In this note please indicate your
area of interest, and please send along a c.v. if
you have one. As part of the application process
we ask for a preliminary research proposal, but
this need not be done until after the official
application forms have been submitted.The PhD in Digital Humanities itself began in Autumn 2005.
