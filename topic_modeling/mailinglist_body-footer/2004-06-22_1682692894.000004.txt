implementing the standard poorly when Microsoft jumped the gun and=20
included it in Internet Explorer 5 before the standard was final. W3C=20
made significant changes in the standard after that, leaving many IE5=20
users high and dry. I don't use MSXSL myself, but my understanding is=20
that more recent versions are standards compliant, and it may even be=20
one of the better XSLT processors.MSXSL does have extensions, which you need to avoid if you want a script=20
to be portable; but then so do the Apache and Saxon processors. Everyone=20
is supposed to use a different namespace for their extensions=20
(Microsoft's is msxsl:), and that makes them easy to identify. But the=20
presence of extensions does not make the processor non-standard, as long=20
as they are implemented in the right way.PeterDaniel O'Donnell wrote:> Does anybody have experience using the recent releases of MSXML? I'm=20
