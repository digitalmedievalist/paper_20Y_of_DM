Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableNeven and others,Last I looked MEI (and MusicXML) could not be used to handle neumes, as these=
 were pitch-based rather than sign-based.The only system for encoding neumes that I know of is Louis Barton's "Neume N=
otation Project," which is XML based  I don't know if this is ready for prime=
 time yet.  You can find info at the following URL:http://www.scribeserver.com/medieval/'Kate Helsen and others are working on a neume transcription project (neume ca=
pture from digital images) as well, although I don't know how far along they =
are on this.  I am working on a similar project that intersects these two, al=
though progress will depend on me getting release time next year to focus on =
this.Michael/***************************************
