' Ecclesiastical historyFri, Jun 12, 2020
Streamed live (and archived indefinitely) at https://youtu.be/d277nrTW668Prosopography is a subject well suited to digital scholarship, and over the l=
ast few decades it has undergone profound changes in how we collate, present =
and locate information. New style =E2=80=98factoid' prosopographies l=
ike the Prosopography of the Byzantine World offer the potential for new anal=
yses and access to data. This paper examines that evolution drawing on my own=
 digital prosopography of Socrates Scholasticus' Ecclesiastical Histo=
ry. It explores decisions taken in modern prosopographies and their alternati=
ves. In particular it looks at options around implication and aggregation, fo=
r deeper analysis of relationship information, and specific issues in Socrate=
s' text itself.ALL WELCOME=3D=3D
