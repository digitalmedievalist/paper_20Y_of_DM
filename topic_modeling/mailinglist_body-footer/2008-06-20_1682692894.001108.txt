Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI just got a query from someone about whether there exist any assistive 
technologies for Old English--she especially mentioned screen readers. 
I've never looked into this: I have no idea whether such technologies 
exist, or if they don't, what it would take to make a screen reader read 
Old English.Does anyone here have any knowledge or experience of this kind, 
suggestions for this person, or advice about possibly creating a tool 
for reading Old English aloud?Thanks,Peter Baker
