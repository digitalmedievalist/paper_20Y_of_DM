    Our Digital Medievalist Website is now up and running 
<www.digitalmedievalist.org>. It is fairly bare bones right now. We've 
built it on the theory that if we did, you would come.
    I am most excited about the RSS server and the project wiki. May I 
encourage you all to contribute to both? We look forward to publishing 
your announcements of software, conference sessions, new projects, etc. 
The wiki will also hopefully become a very valuable resource. I 
encourage you to contribute questions and answers to it. I'll be keeping 
track of discussions we have on dm-l and trying to summarise them when 
relevant in the wiki. Later, I am planning to see if we can use the wiki 
to write collective primers to various common issues.
    With great expectations,
-danP.S. Running the project on no funding, as we are, we have relied on the 
good graces of the U of L CRDC for design assistance. It is possible 
that we have missed broken links, essential help or contact information, 
or the like. Please report any problems you find in the site (or 
suggestions for improvement you have) to me and I will try to get them 
fixed right away.--
