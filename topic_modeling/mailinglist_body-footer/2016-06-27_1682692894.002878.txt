Metropolitan Archives, St. Catherine’s Monastery (Egypt), and the 
Vatican Library. He studied Conservation of Library Materials at Ca’ 
Foscari University Venice, and holds an MA in Digital Culture and 
Technology from King’s College London. He pursued a PhD on an automated 
visualization of historical bookbinding structures at the Ligatus 
Research Centre (University of the Arts, London). He has been working on 
Semantic Web applications to bookbinding descriptions as DH Research 
Fellow at Ligatus and, currently, as DH MMW Fellow at the Herzog August 
Library Wolfenbüttel. From September 2016, he will be working as a 
CLIR/DLF Postdoctoral Fellow in Data Curation for Medieval Studies at

*******************
Franz FischerFranz Fischer has been serving on the Digital Medievalist Executive 
Board since 2014 and is editor-in-chief of the Digital Medievalist 
Journal. He is coordinator and researcher at the Cologne Center for 
eHumanities (CCeH), University of Cologne. He studied History, Latin and 
Italian in Cologne and Rome and has been awarded a doctoral degree in 
Medieval Latin for his digital edition of William of Auxerre’s treatise 
on liturgy. From 2008-2011 he created a digital edition of Saint 
Patrick’s Confessio at the Royal Irish Academy (RIA), Dublin. Franz 
Fischer is currently coordinating the EU funded Marie Curie Initial 
Training Network on Digital Scholarly Editions DiXiT. He is a founding 
member of the Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing (IDE), 
teaching at summer schools and publishing SIDE, a series on digital

Torsten HiltmannTorsten Hiltmann studied History, Philosophy and Psychology at the 
Technical University of Dresden and holds a PhD degree in Medieval 
History from TU Dresden and the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE) 
in Paris (co-tutelle). He collaborated in several database and editorial 
projects at the German Historical Institute Paris, before he changed to 
the University of Münster where he is now a Juniorprofessor for High and 
Late Medieval History and Auxiliary sciences. He is specialised in 
medieval manuscripts, courtly culture and visual communication. In his 
current research project he explores medieval heraldic communication 
from the perspective of cultural history. In the field of Digital 
Humanities he focuses on the use of computational methods in auxiliary 
sciences, with regard to textual as well as visual sources. He is 
especially interested in semantic web technologies, digital editions and 
NLP, as well as methodological reflections about DH, and is developing 
and conducting several projects in these domains. Besides that he is 
editor of the academic blog “Heraldica nova”.*******************
Mike KestemontI enjoy research in computational text and image analysis for the 
Humanities, in particular for medieval European literature. Authorship 
attribution and stylistics are my main areas of expertise: in 
stylometry, we try to design intelligent algorithms which can 
automatically identify the authors of anonymous texts through the 
quantitative analysis of individual writing styles. I warmly recommend 
the documentary about this topic and which we published in the public 
domain: "Authorship and Stylometry: Hildegard of Bingen" 
(vimeo.com/70881172). I am an assistant professor (department of 
literature) at the University of Antwerp and regularly teach workshops 
on Digital Text Analysis and Programming for the Humanities. Currently, 
I am co-authoring a monograph on data science for humanists (with 
Princeton UP) and co-editing a special supplement of Speculum on digital 
medieval studies. I live in Brussels, code in Python 
(github.com/mikekestemont), and tweet in English (@Mike_Kestemont).*******************
Gene LymanAfter significant service as a senior university administrator in charge 
of funds development and public outreach, Gene Lyman returned to his 
first passion – the scholarly study and promotion of medieval 
literature. His Ph.D. thesis, University of Virginia, 2009, addressed 
reconfiguring scholarly editions in digital environments with particular 
emphasis on how findings in cognitive science can make these editions 
more reliable and useful than their printed counterparts. Lyman received 
his B.A. at Yale in the interdisciplinary major, History, the Arts, and 
Letters. He has presented papers at conferences in North America and 
Europe on subjects of special importance to digital editorial theory and 
practice, late medieval scribal practices, Chaucer, and the development 
of software for display and analysis of scholarly texts. He is currently 
the Medieval Academy of America's Treasurer, Finance Committee Chair, a 
Centennial Committee member, and ex officio member of its Executive 
Committee. He created the Elwood Viewer for the Piers Plowman Electronic 
Archive, where he also an editor. He is currently the Reviews Editor for 
DM.*******************
Lynn RansomLynn Ransom is the Curator of Programs at the Schoenberg Institute for 
Manuscripts Studies at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. Since 
2008, she has directed the Schoenberg Database for Manuscripts, which is 
currently being redeveloped into an online, user-driven, 
community-maintained tool for the study of the movement of manuscripts 
across time and geography. She has also been the primary organizer for 
the Annual Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age 
since 2008. Prior to coming to Penn, Dr. Ransom has held curatorial and 
research positions at the Free Library of Philadelphia and the Walters 
Art Museum in Baltimore and at the Index of Christian Art at Princeton 
University. She received her PhD in Art History from the University of 
Texas at Austin, specializing in 13th-century French manuscript 
illumination in 2001. She has published on the role of imagery in 
devotional practice from the 13th to the 16th century.*******************
Georg VogelerI'm a trained medievalist with a specialisation in historical auxiliary 
sciences. I did my PhD on late medieval tax administration records and 
my habilitation on the use of the charters of Emperor Frederic II in 
Italy. Meanwhile I got intreagued with digital methods, started the 
Charters Encoding Initiative (http://www.cei.lmu.de), contributed to the 
technical development of largest charter portal monasterium.net 
(http://www.monasterium.net, http://github.com/icaruseu/mom-ca), became 
member of the Institut für Dokumentologie und Editorik 
(http://www.i-d-e.de) and engaged in other fields of digital methods in 
medieval studies. Finally I ended up as chair for Digital Humanities at 
the Centre for Information Modelling at Graz University and member of 
the board of the digital medievalist. In the DM board I try to support 
those in the front line from the background. If reelected this would not 
change. But I would hope and try to put effort into, that the DM 
community can broaden its self perception from people being subscribed 
to a mailing list to enthusiasts of digital tools applied to medieval 
studies who are engaged in lots of activities: social media, scholarly 
publications, conferences, research projects.--===============9021919340980569582==--
