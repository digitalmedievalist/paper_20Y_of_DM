s 2012 are now available online. They include a paper I wrote on 3D and its i=
mplications for studying and digitally preserving early illuminated manuscrip=
ts http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/openbook/chapter/dhc2012-endres . The paper dis=
cusses the high resolution, interactive 3D images of the 8th-century St Chad =
Gospels https://lichfield.as.uky.edu and greatly expands on topics covered in=
 my video http://youtu.be/ebr0HNnNNrs =E2=80=94 you might find the paper espe=
cially helpful if you are using the 3D images as a way to engage students in =
your teaching.The published proceedings include many fine papers, but Andrew Prescott write=
s a particularly wonderful historical essay about DH as a space in which tink=
ering, making and theory collide.All best,
Bill--
