I have recently discovered this tool, by a Spanish team, named GIDOC or 
"Gimp-based Interactive transcription of old text DOCuments": it is 
defined as a "computer-assisted transcription prototype for handwritten 
text in old documents", and is, interestingly, built as a GIMP plugin. 
It can be downloaded here, together with some demonstration material, a 
demo video etc:
http://prhlt.iti.es/projects/multimodal/idoc/content.php?page=gidoc.phpMuch remains to be done in terms of OCR and automatic / assisted 
transcription of ancient documents, and this tool certainly isn't the 
definitive solution to all our problems, but I find the approach 
interesting (open source, plugged in another tool like GIMP, etc.)Any thoughts / experiences?Best, Marjorie--
