comments that the community submitted and made only very minor changes
to the proposed bylaw modifications. Also we've had some problems with
the DM website recently, which hopefully should now be rectified.If you have a look at
http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws-new.html to see the proposed
modifications to the bylaws, and then please go vote on whether you
accept them at:http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RS2CWQLIt is a very simple yes/no/abstain vote, and will pass as long as at
least two-thirds of recorded votes have voted yes.  (Though we'd hope
that most of you would vote yes.)The survey will be open until the 1 November.Many thanks for your cooperation,-James Cummings
Digital Medievalist, Director
