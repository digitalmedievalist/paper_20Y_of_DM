The Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS) has published a new Guide to Good
Practice, 'Developing  Linguistic Corpora'. It is edited by Martin Wynne from
the Literature, Languages and Linguistics branch of the AHDS, which is hosted=
 by
the Oxford Text Archive.The printed book can be ordered online from Oxbow Books
(http://www.oxbowbooks.com/) for =C2=A315 plus post and packing, and the full
text is available for free online at http://ahds.ac.uk/linguistic-corpora/In this volume, a selection of leading experts offer advice to help the reader
to ensure that their corpus is well-designed and fit for the
intended purpose.As John Sinclair writes in the first chapter: "A corpus is a remarkable thing,
not so much because it is a collection of language text, but
because of the properties that it acquires if it is well-designed and
carefully-constructed."The collection includes the following chapters:* 'Corpus and text: basic principles' by John Sinclair
* 'Adding linguistic annotation' by Geoffrey Leech
* 'Metadata for corpus work' by Lou Burnard
* 'Character encoding in corpus construction' by Tony McEnery and
Richard Xiao
* 'Spoken language corpora' by Paul Thompson
* 'Archiving, distribution and preservation' by Martin WynneJohn Sinclair sets out ten principles for corpus design, plus a new definition
of a corpus. Geoffrey Leech offers a taxonomy of types of
annotations as well as clear guidelines and some provisional standards for
annotation at various linguistic levels. Lou Burnard explains the
different types of metadata which can be provided for a corpus, and gives
examples of how these can be implemented using the Text Encoding
Initiative guidelines. Tony McEnery and Richard Xiao take on the tricky issue=
 of
encoding characters in languages other than English, giving an historical
overview of the various solutions, leading to a discussion of how to use Unic=
ode
today in encoding corpus texts. Paul Thompson draws on his experience in
developing the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus to set out the
stages involved in the development and exploitation of a corpus of speech,
covering data collection, transcription, markup and annotation, and access. In
chapter six, Martin
Wynne explains how good planning and design can help to ensure the ongoing
availability and usefulness of a corpus.This and other guides in the series are available from
