Humanities at KCL has been involved in the development of the SNAP:DRGN 
project (http://snapdrgn.net/), allowing them to build upon skills 
acquired during their Masters Degree, including coding tasks with 
Python, RDF, SPARQL queries and improvements to the final HTML pages, as 
well as administrative tasks such as communicating and negotiating with 
potential contributors for the expansion of the dataset. This seminar 
will analyse the pedagogical value of this initiative for postgraduate 
students approaching the work world or further academic study.ALL WELCOME--
