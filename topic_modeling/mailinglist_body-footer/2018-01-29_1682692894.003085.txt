Dear colleagues,The Textual Heritage community and Vienna University are pleased to 
invite submissions of abstracts for the El’Manuscript-2018 international 
conference on the creation and development of information systems for 
storage, description, processing, analysis, and publication of medieval 
and early modern handwritten and printed texts and documentary records. 
Any person involved in the creation or application of these 
resources—including researchers; instructors; staff of libraries, 
museums, and archives; programmers, and undergraduate and graduate 
students—is welcome to participate.
El’Manuscript-2018 is the seventh in a series of biennial international 
conferences entitled “Textual Heritage and Information Technologies” 
that brings together linguists, specialists in historical source 
criticism, IT specialists, and others involved in studying and 
publishing our textual heritage. Along with the lectures, a summer 
school will be part of the conference, which will allow practitioners to 
become familiar with various systems and methods for working with 
manuscripts and texts.
The working language of the 2018 conference is English. In the 
philological sections talks in Russian are welcome, but should be 
accompanied by powerpoint slides in English. Papers presented at the
