Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Dr. Wisnicki and All,I'm not sure if this is totally relevant, but I think that it is.  In =20
dealing with the Greek manuscripts that were discovered at St. =20
Catherine's (the Sinai) a couple of decades ago (I think), James =20
Charlesworth (of Princeton Theological Seminary) was able to use =20
imaging technology from NASA (I believe) to recover images in =20
palimpsest leaves.  (He talked about this while he was at Oberlin  =20
giving the Haskell Lectures).I'll try to follow up on this a bit.  (And this technology may be =20
widely known by now.)  It seems like it would work to distinguish =20
between the "two texts".Best regardsGrover ZinnGrover A. Zinn
