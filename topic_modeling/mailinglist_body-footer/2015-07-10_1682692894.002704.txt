a new post on our blog that reflects on the practices of digital
humanities/digital medievalism, specifically with respect to the
importance of explicitly documenting who did what in the context of a
given project.  It was sparked by one of the talks at the "Middle Ages
in the Modern World" conference in Lincoln last week, as well as by my
own practices implemented in the running of the DMNES.  I'd be
interested in any feedback or counterpoints any of you might have:https://dmnes.wordpress.com/2015/07/10/digital-humanities-medievalism-and-the=
-importance-of-errors/Cheers,
