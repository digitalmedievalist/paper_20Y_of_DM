website that is affecting the processing of our XML. I'm surprised to
see no redundancy was built in and am doing my best to fix it. With the
Labour day weekend in Canada and the US (the TEI site is hosted at
Virginia, I believe), it may take a little while for service to be
restored.-d--===============1522056528789623980==--
