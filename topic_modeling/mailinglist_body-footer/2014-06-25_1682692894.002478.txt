WC1E 7HUMonica Berti, Greta Franzini & Simona Stoyanova (Leipzig)
The Leipzig Open Fragmentary Texts Series and Digital Fragmenta 
Historicorum Graecorum ProjectsALL WELCOMEThe Leipzig Open Fragmentary Texts Series (LOFTS) is a new collaborative 
project that seeks to create open electronic editions of ancient works 
that survive only through quotations and text re-uses in later texts. 
The large diversity and dispersion of these materials entreats a dynamic 
infrastructure which fully supports and represents the relationships 
between sources, citations and annotations. LOFTS links fragments to the 
source text from which they are drawn, and aligns them to multiple 
editions and translations, thus providing an enhanced understanding of 
the fragmentary textual heritage it showcases.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.
