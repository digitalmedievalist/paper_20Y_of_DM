non-proprietary international standards (e.g. XHTML, Unicode, ECMAScript,=20
etc.).The user agrees to install one of the many free browsers which is capable=20
of handling the current standards.Thus everyone is happy. If users choose to use obsolete or bad browsers,=20
then that's their privilege, but most developers don't have time or money=20
to produce code to support that kind of thing. If developers choose to=20
write sites that aren't based on standards, they deserve to have their=20
sites ignored, and ultimately inaccessible to the majority of people.All of the current versions of these browsers have pretty good support for=20
the current crop of standards:Firefox, Mozilla, Camino, Internet Explorer (Windows), Safari, Opera, Netscap=
e.That's not a bad range of choices.Cheers,
