serious difficulties to consistently show the different categories of=20
political entities in view of the evolution of political ideas.
That is why, we are currently trying to work out an impartial and=20
consistent solution allowing to depict all kind of polities throughout=20
history regardless of the ideas of the time, as a formal model which in=20
reality goes beyond the simple stage of historical geography.
Thus we published the draft A FORMAL MODEL FOR HISTORICAL ATLASES AND=20
HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE which is the first part of our research.

nd-historical-knowledge?source=3Dlink
In the second step, we will define precisely the criteria for assigning=20
properties to objects.Persons interested can receive an invitation code in order to create=20
their own graph in our model.Sincerely________________________________________
