the Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School (4-8 July 2016) could be
extended from those seeking institutional or other funding. Our events team
have negotiated with some of our suppliers and we've managed to extend it
by one week to the 13 June 2016.  They have also been able to reserve some
additional accommodation (the main accommodation is filling up quickly).
However, the extended deadline is not a guarantee that there will be space
on your chosen workshop. Book early to guarantee a place!-James====
