ould be able to include without too much trouble. As well as automatic adding=
 to Zotero, I think it would also be useful to add a manual 'Download to cita=
tion manager' option, but I wonder what formats people want. Certainly Bibtex=
, Endnote, perhaps Delicious. Procite? Reference Manager? What else are we us=
ing these days?Peter--
