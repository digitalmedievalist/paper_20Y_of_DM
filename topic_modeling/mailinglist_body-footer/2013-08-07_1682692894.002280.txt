Agnes Thomas, Francesco Mambrini & Matteo Romanello (DAI, Berlin),'Insights in the World of Thucydides: The Hellespont Project as a research en=
vironment for Digital History'
ALL WELCOME
The Hellespont Project aims to integrate two of the largest online collection=
s for the study of Antiquity, the Perseus Digital Library and the Arachne arc=
haeological database, in a dynamic digital research environment. Our case stu=
dy is focused on a limited historical period, the 50 years in the history of =
Athens between the Persian Wars and the outburst of the Peloponnesian War (43=
1 BCE), following the narration presented by Thucydides (1.89-118). Our goal =
is to create a =E2=80=9Cdigital sourcebook=E2=80=9D where the different sourc=
es (texts and images) are linked and enriched with linguistic, archaeological=
 and historical annotation.
The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.
