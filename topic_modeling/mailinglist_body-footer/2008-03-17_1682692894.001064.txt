and less of a members' meeting pur sang. If you are interested in
markup--and even better if you have something to say about it--please
consider this conference.You don't have to drink TEI coolaid: some of our best talks last year
addressed problems with the TEI and its implementation.TEI Members' Meeting Date: 6-8 November 2008 Venue: King's College London, UK Host: Centre for Computing in the Humanities Conference Website: http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/tei2008/ The Programme Committee of the TEI Members' Meeting invites individual
proposals for presentations on the theme, broadly conceived, 'TEI:
Supporting Cultural Heritage Research'. Proposals may be for individual
paper presentations, panel sessions or poster sessions (including tool
demonstrations). This year's meeting will feature three days of keynote
lectures, parallel sessions, the annual TEI business meeting, a poster
session/tools demonstration and slam, as well as a full meeting day (8
November) for TEI Special Interest Groups (SIGs). We are especially pleased to announce keynote talks by Vanda Broughton
(University College London), Dino Buzzetti (University of Bologna), and
Charlotte Rouech√© (King's College London). Please join us in participating in this 21st anniversary meeting of the
TEI. ** Submission Topics ** Topics might include but are not restricted to: - TEI-based projects involving cultural heritage - Using TEI to create:       * - scholarly editions - hybrid publications (digital and print) - Tools that use TEI - TEI used in conjunction with:       * - different technologies - other standards - TEI as:       * - metadata standard - interchange format: sharing, mapping and
        migrating data - TEI and its contribution to digital scholarship - TEI and markup theory In addition, we are seeking P5 micropaper proposals for 5 minute
presentations on the topic "My favourite (or least favourite) P5
feature, chapter, or addition". ** Submission Types ** Individual paper presentations will be allocated 30 minutes: 20 minutes
for delivery, and 10 minutes for questions & answers. Panel sessions will be allocated 1.5 hours and may be of varied formats,
including: - Three paper panels: 3 papers on the same or related topics; - Working paper session: 3-6 papers circulated and read by the audience
in advance, so the entire session is dedicated to discussion of and
questions & answers about, the papers rather than presenting the
papers; - Round table discussion: 3-6 presenters on a single theme. Ample time
should be left for questions & answers after brief presentations. Posters (including tool demonstrations) will be presented during the
poster session. The local organizer will provide flip charts and tables
for poster session/tool demonstration presenters, along with wireless
internet access. Each poster will have the opportunity to participate in
a slam immediately preceding the poster session. P5 micropapers will be allocated 5 minutes. For submission procedures, please see
<http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/tei2008/cfp/index.html> All proposals should be submitted at http://www.tei-c.org/conftool/ by
30 April 2008. Please send queries to the meeting chair, susan.schreibman(a)gmail.com--
