project communications, and for co-ordinating
manuscript-based research, developing both
electronic and print outputs, and producing
written research at the highest level; candidates
therefore must have a doctorate in a relevant
period and discipine (or comparable research
excellence), experience in handling medieval
and/or early modern manuscripts, and excellent
oral and written communication skills. Those with
a proven research record, and with experience
with one or more of the manuscript subject areas
(e.g. English and/or Latin poetry, heraldry, law,
medicine, theology), will be preferred.
Faculty-based mentoring will be available.Further details and an application form for both
posts can be downloaded from the English Faculty
website or obtained from the Secretary to the
Appointments Committee, Faculty of English, 9
West Road, Cambridge, CB3 9DP (tel: 01223 335074,

indicate in their application whether they wish
to be considered for one or both posts.Referees should be asked to write directly to the
Secretary to reach the Faculty by the closing
date of 6 June 2008. Interviews will be held on 27 June 2008.See also <http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/jobs/index.htm>
