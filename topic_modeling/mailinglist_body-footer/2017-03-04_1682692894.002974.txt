the launch of *REED Online* (http://ereed.library.utoronto.ca), its new
open-access website. The site features REED's first digital edition of
dramatic records for the county of Staffordshire, encoded in TEI. Easily
searched with a number of useful filters, online records appear
conveniently on the same page as their translations, document descriptions,
and any glosses or related endnotes. GIS mapping based on the *Patrons and
Performances* map of historic county boundaries and main roads illuminates
significant details further. For students and those new to records
research, search tips, an introduction to the research process, and an
anatomy of a sample record provide a welcoming guide.The *Staffordshire* records, edited by J.A.B. Somerset, are found in
scattered collections, but they yield fascinating glimpses of early social
and economic history through accounts of public performances, social
occasions, royal welcomes, folk customs, and professional entertainments. A
few examples highlight the richness of the collection, which includes two
royal visits – by Queen Elizabeth in 1576 and, more extensively, King James
I in 1615. The records of Tutbury, whose castle was a major administrative
centre for the household of John of Gaunt, show us from 1380 a flourishing
Minstrel Court while the accounts of Burton Manor, home to Thomas, Lord
Paget reveal an Elizabethan household filled with music, playing, and
revels. By contrast, Newcastle under Lyme sources record evidence of
implacable hatred of players, levying large fines upon persons who allowed
playing, and firing the town constable for turning a blind eye. For those
interested in tracking the itineraries of professional troupes across the
kingdom, new details of performance troupes visiting Stafford and Walsall
as well as the private residences of Beaudesert, Blithfield, and Burton
will be important.*Staffordshire* is REED's pilot digital publication, with more collections
forthcoming on the same website to enable easy cross-collection searching.
As REED begins planning for the production of the next collection for the
county of Berkshire, the integration of *Patrons and Performances* data,
and the further development of *REED Online*, it welcomes all comments and
suggestions from users. Please send any feedback to REED’s project manager,
Carolyn Black, at ca.black(a)utoronto.ca.REED gives special thanks to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
Council of Canada for a Connection grant that has made possible development
of our digital publishing framework for *REED Online*.
