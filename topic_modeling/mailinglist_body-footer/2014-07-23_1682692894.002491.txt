Papyrology and Linguistic Annotation: How can we make TEI EpiDoc XML 
corpus and Treebanking work together?Greek documentary papyri provide a rich source for linguists who wish to 
study Ancient Greek as it was written in everyday texts, preserved 
directly from antiquity. The corpus is already in digital form, but it 
does not contain linguistic annotation that would help linguists find 
interesting structures and forms. This paper presents a preliminary 
phase of a project focused on annotating the fragmentary and manifold 
papyrus material using a Dependency Treebank model.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information see the seminar website at
