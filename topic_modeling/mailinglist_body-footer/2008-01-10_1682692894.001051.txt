this. Currently I keep my office, home office, and notebook computer
synched using an rsynch script that I run each time I log on and log
out: what happens is that when I run the log-in script, I collect the
files from my base computer (the one that is backed up) and when I run
the log out script, I update the files on the base computer from
whichevery one I am using.The problem is that sometimes I forget to run either one or the other of
the scripts and I endup losing data: mostly this affects my locally
archived mail.I was looking into rsynch further, and began to wonder if I used it with
the -u option (this prevents rsych from over writing is the target file
is newer) if I might not be able to set up a system where the remote
computers rsynched to the base computer constantly (i.e. I would set up
a cron job so that rysnch was run on the remote computer with the -u
option every five minutes or hour or something similar).Has anybody tried anything like this? The trouble with rsynch always is
that if you mess it up it starts knocking giant holes in your data.-dan--
