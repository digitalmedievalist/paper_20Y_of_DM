"can be described using special-purpose tags." The thing that would be 
most helpful, actually, is a universally accepted "controlled 
vocabulary" for paleographic description, either verbal or in terms of 
graphical metrics (or ideally both), on which we could build descriptive 
structures in XML or whatever. I don't think paleographers are close to 
having that.MurrayArianna Ciula wrote:>So, when you say
