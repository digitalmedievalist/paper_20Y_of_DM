There are many complex ways in which archaeology is written about. 
Formal publications in journals, books, site reports, so-called 'grey 
literature', field notes, excavation daybooks, diaries and, latterly, 
websites and blogs, all contain a collective written discourse about the 
past, and how it is discovered. Added to this may be historical sources 
about sites and artefacts: if excavating a site of the Classical period 
in Greece for example, it is likely that the excavator will wish to 
consult Classical authors such as Strabo or Thucydides. Furthermore, 
evidence from text bearing objects such as inscriptions will heavily 
influence the interpretation of any site at which it is found. Hitherto, 
an excavator is likely to have accessed most secondary documentary 
evidence via institutional libraries and catalogues, or via booksellers 
or publishers. However, the relatively recent provision on a large scale 
of such documentary evidence digitally --- the Perseus library at Tufts, 
and online inscriptions corpora such as the Inscriptions of Roman 
Cyrenaica and Inscriptions of Aphrodisias are good examples --- combined 
with increasingly sophisticated techniques for interrogating that 
content, and extracting information automatically, prompts us to rethink 
the very nature of the evidence with which we can form interpretations 
about the past. Once distinctions between text and artefact, history (or 
philology) and archaeology were clear. Now however (for example) texts 
can be parsed for formal units of information and databases of entities 
built, which can then be used to underpin new knowledge or enhance 
resource discovery. On the other hand, the bases of comparanda for 
assessing archaeological data are becoming more widely available in 
digital form, along with digital representations of those artefacts, 
allowing deeper comparison and (textual) annotation. This prompts 
questions as to how the digital medium can be used in their 
interpretation. This session will seek to explore these distinctions by 
bringing together archaeologists with interests in textual evidence, 
textual scholars, historians and philologists. Themes will include, but 
are not limited to:* Theoretical considerations of the nature of textual and archaeological 
evidence
* The use of standards and mark-up schemas in digitized archaeology texts
* Text mining and parsing (especially including geoparsing), and 
automatic entity extraction
* Linking textual evidence with archaeological evidence using linked 
data and semantic web technologies
* Provision for non-Latin texts in digital libraries for archaeology, 
with an emphasis on Chinese and other Asian scripts particularly encouraged--
