=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DToward a new social contract between publishers and editors26 January 2015, Maison de Science de l'Homme =E2=80=93 Alpes, Grenob=
leNeDiMAH, the Network for Digital Methods in the Arts and Humanities, is delig=
hted to announce this one-day seminar, which will bring together publishers a=
nd scholarly editors in order to discuss how best to produce digital editions=
 which are at the same time both economically viable and in keeping with scho=
larly standards.In the pre-digital world, publishers and editors normally collaborated: the e=
ditors would produce the edition, following the guidelines provided by the pu=
blishing house, which for its part would take care of marketing and distribut=
ion, as well as essential scholarly services such as peer review. Digital sch=
olarly editions, on the other hand, tend to be self-published by scholars wit=
hin their own universities, most often without any connection with a publishi=
ng house =E2=80=93 an arrangement which is hardly sustainable, for various re=
asons, and often not available to younger researchers producing their first e=
ditions and without access to suitable funding. At the same time, publishers =
are increasingly engaging with the digital, in particular in connection with =
tablet distribution. But the majority of such eBooks are generally not up to =
the standards expected by the scholarly community: in many ePubs, for instanc=
e, basic features such as footnotes are a luxury =E2=80=93 to say nothing of =
a proper critical apparatus. How can be we best address these issues, to the =
mutual benefit of all involved parties =E2=80=93 editors, publishers and the =
scholarly public?Organizers:
