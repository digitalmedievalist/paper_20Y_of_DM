Sorry for my many postings today.
When the listserver crashed this morning it reset a number of options on 
the list, including one important setting which I have just restored:***When you hit reply on this list, your e-mail will be automatically 
distributed to the list***. If you want to e-mail somebody privately, 
you will need to enter their address explicitly in the address line. 
This was the original setting, but it was changed this morning by accident.This behaviour is the same as that found on ansax-l, and medtext-l, but 
is different from that on tei-l. The main danger comes if you are 
complaining about a posting to a friend. If you're not careful, you may 
end up posting your comments publicly. Since none of us would do that, 
however, we should be o.k.
