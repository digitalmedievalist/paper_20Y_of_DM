Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI am producing a concordance of the English vernacular texts that
scholarship allows as Wycliffite or Lollard in persuasion. I would like
to add more texts, and am attempting to work out a few issues on which I
wondered if anyone might have advice.For information I have recently been using R.J.C. Watt's programme
Concordance (http://www.concordancesoftware.co.uk/); however, due to a
significant problem with hyphenated words---Watt's Help file
specifically states that it does not treat hyphenated words, which are
divided between 2 lines, as single words---I am thinking of switching
back to TACT or to another programme.It's been some years since I used TACT. Is anyone fluent in TACT and
willing to field the odd question or two which Ian Lancashire's book
Using TACT with Electronic Texts does not answer? Or, alternatively, can
anyone recommend a better programme?Line numbering: Aside from keying in line numbers by hand (which I have
been doing), is there a macro or application that can automate the line
numbering process in large numbers of texts in Word or Word Pad?Page numbering: As above, is there a macro or application that can
automate the page numbering process in large numbers of texts? NB: the
end of the printed page in electronic format rarely corresponds with the
end of a Word or Word Pad page.Many thanks for any suggestions anyone might be able to make.
