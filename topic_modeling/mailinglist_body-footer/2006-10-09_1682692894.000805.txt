the  
University of Tennessee, Knoxville will host a two-day workshop on  
manuscript studies on February 9 and 10, 2007. The workshop's co- 
directors are Thomas E. Burman (History), Maura K. Lafferty  
(Classics), and Roy Liuzza (English).        Last year’s workshop discussed the practices of textual
editing;  
this year’s topic is “Everything but the Text,” by which we mean the  
many different sorts of things that appear above, around, into,  
beside or between texts in manuscripts: glosses, marginalia,  
punctuation, running headings, chapter divisions, interpolations,  
additions, accompanying works, illustrations, doodles, pen trials,  
bits of stray poetry or prose, pointing fingers, etc. Such material  
can be easy to overlook, difficult to represent and baffling to  
explain, but it can also tell us a great deal about how manuscripts,  
and the texts in them, were read, used, and understood. The theme is  
meant to be understood as broadly as possible; we would especially  
welcome participation by scholars working on the relation between  
text and image, the compilation of anthologies and miscellanies,  
epigraphy and inscribed objects, page design and meaning, systems for  
indexing, organizing, or linking commentary to text, and so on.        The workshop is open to scholars and students at any rank and
from  
any discipline. Individual ninety-minute sessions will be devoted to  
each participant’s project; participants will introduce their  
material and its contexts, discuss their approaches to working with  
this material, and exchange ideas and information about how to  
represent and interpret this important evidence. Like last year, the  
workshop is intended to be more like a class than a conference;  
participants will be invited to discuss both their successes and  
frustrations, and to work together towards developing a repertoire of  
professional skills for textual studies. We particularly encourage  
works in progress, the presentation of unusual manuscript problems or  
practical difficulties, new technologies and experimental models for  
studying or representing manuscripts. Presenters will receive a  
stipend of $500 for their participation.The deadline for proposals is November 15, 2006; please submit a  
current CV and a two-page letter describing your project to:Professor Roy M. Liuzza
Department of English
University of Tennessee
301 McClung Tower
Knoxville, TN 37996-0430
or via email to rliuzza(a)utk.edu.The workshop is also open to scholars and students who do not wish to  
present their work but may be interested in learning more about  
manuscript research in an informal and collegial environment. Non- 
presenters will not receive a stipend, but are encouraged to  
participate in discussions and all other activities. Those wishing to  
attend should contact Professor Liuzza at the above address for more  
information, or visit the workshop homepage at http://web.utk.edu/

registration form.        Thank you,        Roy Liuzza
