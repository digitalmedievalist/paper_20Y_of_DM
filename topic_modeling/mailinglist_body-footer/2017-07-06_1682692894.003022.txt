*Helping Users to Explore Collated Manuscripts*Elisa Nury (Kingâ€™s College London)The comparison of manuscripts and recording of variant readings is an
essential, but challenging task towards the preparation of a scholarly
edition. A large amount of detailed data is collected during collation, and
needs to be analysed and visualized. In the recent years, the use of
digital format has been increasingly incorporated within the collation
workflow: from writing down variants in Word or Excel documents to adopting
complex automated collation tools such as CollateX. This presentation will
focus on a method to help scholars and readers visualize collation results
of a Latin text in a digital format.Seminar will be livecast at: https://youtu.be/1YB_mFJ9SlQFull abstract: http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2017-06en.htmlALL WELCOME--
