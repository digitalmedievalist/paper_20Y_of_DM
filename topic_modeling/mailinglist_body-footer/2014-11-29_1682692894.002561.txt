gnosed=E2=80=9D plague image from the 14th century:  Monica H. Green, Kathlee=
n Walker-Meikle, and Wolfgang MÃ¼ller, =E2=80=9CDiagnosis of a =E2=80=98P=
lague' Image: A Digital Cautionary Tale,=E2=80=9D in Pandemic Disease=
 in the Medieval World: Rethinking the Black Death, inaugural issue of The Me=
dieval Globe 1 (Fall 2014), 309-26, available open-access at: http://scholarw=
orks.wmich.edu/medieval_globe/1/.  (Open-access funding was underwritten in t=
his case by the World History Center at the University of Pittsburgh.)I'm sending notification to this list because this study may have imp=
lications for the wider Digital Medievalist community. What we argue is that =
a mistaken label was attached to an image being sold in the British Library=
's =E2=80=9CImages Online=E2=80=9D database (where high-quality image=
s are sold for a fee): the BL labels it =E2=80=9CPlague victims blessed by pr=
iest." As far as we were able to determine, the misinformation originated wit=
h the staff of the BL and did not come from earlier scholarly misinterpretati=
ons. We argue that in fact it is clearly an image of leprosy=E2=80=94a =E2=80=
=9Creading=E2=80=9D of the image supported both by medieval iconographic trad=
itions and, more importantly, by the text which surrounds the image in its or=
iginal manuscript context.  (We provide a full edition and translation of the=
 Latin text in our study.)The British Library has been apprised of our study, and they responded that t=
hey do intend to alter the meta-data attached to the image in their databases=
. I assume that also means that they will cease to market it as a =E2=80=9Cpl=
ague=E2=80=9D image. (Images Online is the fee-based distribution office of t=
he BL; the image is also available, at a lower resolution, in the BL Illumina=
ted Manuscripts catalogue, where it is under a CC0 license.) Even if they cor=
rect the metadata, however, there is no way to =E2=80=9Ctake back=E2=80=9D al=
l the incorrect uses of the image, given how widely it has already been disse=
minated into popular culture with the mistaken interpretation. (Most recently=
, in the BBC's History magazine, October 2014, p. 90.)I am not a coder myself and have only a user's appreciation of the te=
chnical side of Digital Humanities.  Still, given that metadata might well be=
 seen as having a comparable value to the medieval texts and images we are co=
ncerned to digitize and/or analyze digitally, I thought this might be a case =
that people might find instructive.Please feel free to contact me directly (monica.green(a)asu.edu) should you h=
ave any further questions about the image or our study.--
