http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/). It's written in C and is pretty fast. It also
includes EXSLT and some of saxon's extensions. (Saxon may provide EXSLT too:
it's been awhile since I've looked at its features.) I've used it with good
results, but if I were comfortable with saxon and didn't need libxslt's
extra features, I don't know that I'd switch.EricOn 9/28/05, Daniel Paul O'Donnell <daniel.odonnell(a)uleth.ca> wrote:
