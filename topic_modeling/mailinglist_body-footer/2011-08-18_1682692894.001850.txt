the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image at the University of
Pennsylvania is pleased to announce the completion of the Seymour de Ricci
Bibliotheca Britannica Manuscripta Digitized Archive, a corollary project to
the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts.   The archive is a searchable database containing the digitized notes of the
historian and bibliographer Seymour Montefiore Robert Rosso de Ricci
(1881-1942), made for the compilation of his unfinished census of pre-1800
manuscripts in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. De Ricci's notes,
gathered in thirty-four boxes containing over 60,000 index cards, are
currently housed in the Senate House Library. They are divided into two main
sections: one for repositories (approximately 40,000 slips) and one for
collectors (approximately 20,000 slips). The cards contain information
gleaned from wide reading and especially from sale catalogues of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As the Senate House Library website for the archive states, the notes are
"idiosyncratic but recklessly and persistently useful."
