Exploring the Productivity of Homeric Formulae through Distributional Semanti=
csThe language of archaic Greek epic is overwhelmingly composed of formulae, i.=
e. repeated, rigid linguistic structures. Formulae do show some limited varia=
tion in their form; however, describing the boundaries and the mechanisms dri=
ving formulaic variation is notably difficult. Computational methods on large=
-scale digital collections can shed new light onto this problem. We present t=
he first computational model which uses Distributional Semantics to assess ho=
w meaning variation drives formulaic productivity in ancient Greek epic. By c=
omparing the distribution of meanings in archaic vs. later poetry, we can det=
ect trends of development in formulaic usage through time and investigate the=
ir causes.This seminar will be livestreamed to https://youtu.be/NTVa05fOIz4Full programme: http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2019.htmlALL WELCOME
