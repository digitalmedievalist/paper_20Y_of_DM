is now online. This year's theme is the computer-assisted study of medieval
manuscripts, which should be relevant to everyone here! There'll be a range
of papers covering language, manual and automatic script analysis, on-line
curation, music notation, image retrieval and palaeography (of course!).
Speakers include two prominent DM contributors, Peter Stokes and
Dominique Stutzmann. Papers also from David Ganz, Julian Harrison,
Jane Roberts, Lambert Stomacher and Tessa Webber and more.Places are disappearing rather rapidly, so if you'd like to attend, then plea=
se
send an email to "digipal [at] kcl.ac.uk<http://kcl.ac.uk/>", including your =
details as you would
like them to appear on your name badge. Oh, and do let us know if you are
vegetarian.Full details here: http://digipal.eu/blog/programme2013/Looking forward to seeing you later this month,Stewart Brookes
