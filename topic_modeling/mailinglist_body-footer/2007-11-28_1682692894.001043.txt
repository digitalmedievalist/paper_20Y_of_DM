Firefox extension. It's note as versatile as a dedicated  
bibliographical software but can do more then that and can prove  
valuable as an overall research tool.I am also using jabref (http://jabref.sourceforge.net/), written in  
Java, open source and BibTex based. It's not exactly user friendly but  
quite powerful.Best,
