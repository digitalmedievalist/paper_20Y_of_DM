deals with the application of geospatial computing in the fields of 
archaeology and history:http://www.arts-humanities.net/mapping_pastThis group originated from the AHRC ICT Methods Network workshop 
'Space/Time: Methods in geospatial computing for mapping the past' held 
in Edinburgh earlier this week:
http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/activities/act24.htmlAfter two days of lively discussion, we concluded that it would be 
interesting to continue the exchange of ideas beyond the event itself – 
and to invite other interested parties to join us. As we did some live 
blogging during the workshop, you can get an idea of the questions and 
problems we discussed. A more formal report, papers and presentations 
will be published later.This group is part of a new online community initiative called 'Digital 
Arts & Humanities' that is being developed by the Methods Network and 
partners and is hosted at King's College London: 
http://www.arts-humanities.netPlease circulate this email to colleagues and friends who might be 
interested!Stuart Dunn, Leif Isaksen and Torsten Reimer
