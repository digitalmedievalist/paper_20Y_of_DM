'Can computers ever read ancient texts?'
Researchers in the Centre of the Study of Ancient Documents, and the 
Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford (and now UCL 
SLAIS), have been attempting to build a system to aid historians in 
reading damaged and deteriorated texts, specifically those from 
Vindolanda. But to what extent can computers ever hope to "read" 
ancient texts, and how can computers aid (not replace) historians in 
propagating readings from hard to read documentary material?ALL WELCOME
The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk or
