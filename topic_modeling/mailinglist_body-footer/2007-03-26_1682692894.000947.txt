and custodians of Digital Resources in the Arts and HumanitiesOver the last decade the annual Digital Resources for the Humanities and=
  Arts
(DRHA) conferences have constructed an unusual kind of meeting place: a=
  space
in which researchers, curators, and distributors of digital resources could
meet and share perspectives on their complementary agendas. Last year, that
forum was expanded to include participants from the creative and performing
arts, giving the event a new flavour and a new direction. This year, the
conference aims to explore further major issues at the interface between
traditional humanities scholarship and the=20
creative arts, by focussing on their
differing or complementary approaches to the deployment of digital
technologies. Can the Arts and the Humanities=20
share expertise? Are they divided
by a common tongue? To what extent are they developing common technical
solutions to different problem areas? As in=20
previous years, the conference will
articulate these questions by showcasing the very best in current practice
across the widest spectrum of digital applications in the arts and=
  humanities
and by fostering informed but accessible debate amongst professionals.The Programme Committee for DRHA07 is now soliciting imaginative and
provocative contributions for the conference addressing such topics as:       * the benefits and the challenges of  using=20
digital resources in creative
work, in teaching and learning, and in scholarship;
       * the challenges and opportunities=20
associated with scale and sustainability
in the digital arena;
       * new insights and new forms of expression=20
arising from the integration of
digital resources in the arts, humanities, and sciences;
       * social and political issues surrounding=20
digital resource provision in the
context of global ICT developments;
       * the implications of "born-digital"=20
resources for curators, consumers, and
performers;
       * training methods and best practice for digital arts and humanities
practitioners.Other themes include: interactivity and performance; digital media in time=
  and
space; integration and deployment of existing digital resources in new
contexts; policies and strategies for digital deployment, both commercial=
  and
non-commercial; cataloguing and metadata aspects=20
of resource discovery; digital
repositories; Web 2.0 and other new technologies; encoding standards;
intellectual property rights; funding, cost-recovery, and charging=
  mechanisms;
digitization techniques and problems.Format: The conference will take up three intensive days, comprising
presentation of academic papers and technical reports, performance and
installation events,  software and product=20
demonstrations, debates and training
events.  The atmosphere will be informal, the discussion energetic. Leading
practitioners and representatives of key funding=20
agencies, such as the the Arts
Council, the AHRC, the JISC, and the AHDS  will=20
be amongst the participants. We
hope that from this occasion a new consensus will emerge based on real life
experience of the application of digital techniques and resources in the
Humanities and Arts.Timetable: Proposals are now invited for academic=20
papers, themed panel sessions
and reports of work in progress.Your proposal should be no smaller than 500
words and no longer than 2000; closing date for=20
proposals is  May 2nd 2007. All
proposals will be reviewed by an independent panel of reviewers, and
notifications of acceptance will be sent out by 13th June 2007. All accepted
proposals will be included in the Conference preprint volume, and will also=
  be
considered for a post-conference publication.Cost: The all-in conference rate covering all=20
meals and accomodation as well as
conference registration and proceedings will not=20
exceed =A3400. Reduced rates for
early registration, and partial rates for one-day=20
or non-residential attendance
will be announced shortly on the conference website.Further information: The conference web site at
