In this paper, I consider how customisable approaches to reconstruction might=
 be able to embrace the multivocality and flexibility needed to aid recovery =
following conflict. I start with the debate over accuracy concerning the Inst=
itute of Digital Archaeology's replica Palmyra arch. I argue that, in=
stead, we need to ask why we are creating reconstructions and for whom. I the=
n look at examples from creative practice, including Michael Rakowitz and Mor=
ehshin Allahyari, as inspiration for more participatory and flexible reconstr=
uctions.This seminar will be livecast: https://youtu.be/_fKL09wXofsFull abstract: http://digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2018.htmlALL WELCOME
