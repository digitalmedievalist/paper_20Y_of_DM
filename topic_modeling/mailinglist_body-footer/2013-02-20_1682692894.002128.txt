Università La Sapienza, Rome, Italy* Deadline for submissions: March 31, 2013
* Workshop dates: 30 September - 2 October 2012Conference website: http://digilab2.let.uniroma1.it/teiconf2013/The Programme Committee of the 2013 Annual Conference and Members
Meeting of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI – http://www.tei-c.org)
Consortium invites proposals for educational tutorials or workshops to
precede the conference.The goal of the tutorials is to give an opportunity to learn more
about the use of TEI markup under the guidance of experienced
instructors and practitioners, whereas workshops are an opportunity
for specific groups to meet and work together on a TEI related
subject.Workshops and tutorials range in length from a single morning or
afternoon to a maximum of two days. Tutorials are run on a
cost-recovery basis: a separate fee is charged of participants that is
intended to cover the costs of running the tutorial. Workshops are
expected to be free of charges.If you are interested in proposing either a workshop or a tutorial for
the 2013 Members’ Meeting and Conference, please
contactmeeting(a)tei.org ***as early as possible*** and submit your
proposal
before 31 March 2013 via Conftool, the availability of which will be
announced shortly. Expressions of interest should include as much as
possible of the following information (the committee is willing to
work with proposers in developing their proposals):* Topic
* Rationale explaining why this topic is likely to draw sufficient
attention of the TEI community
* Length of the event
* Infrastructural requirements
- (In the case of a tutorial)
---- * Proposed instructor or slate of instructors including brief
discussion of relevant experience
---- * Preliminary budget of your anticipated costs (if any)
- (In the case of a workshop)
---- * Core list of people who are likely to participate, keeping in
mind that workshops are by essence open for participation
---- * Organisational and infrastructure costs (e.g. coffee breaks and
the like) will be determined later in conjunction with the local
organising committeeTutorial proposals will be evaluated by the programme committee
primarily on the basis of their likely appeal to the TEI community,
the quality of the proposed instructors and method of instruction, and
cost.Please send queries to meeting(a)tei-c.org.For the Programme Committee
