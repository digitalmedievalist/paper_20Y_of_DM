for being difficult to learn to use. The "TEI-Emacs" mentioned in the
e-mail, is a customised version of Emacs distributed by the Text
Encoding Initiative (the major flavour of XML used in our area).I've not tried this editor out yet, as I don't see any information on
whether it will conflict irreparably with my working version of the
latest TEI emacs. But especially for those who have not invested a lot
of time in learning the original version, this might be worth looking
into.I've not added this to our wiki entry on XML editors yet
(http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/XML_Editors), nor is there a
project page for it (http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Projects).
But I will try to get to it toot sweet. Currently the XML editors page
lists emacs (regular) and Oxygen (a commercial editor) as options.
People often have quite strong feelings about their editors. If you know
of/love another, perhaps you might like to add information about it?
