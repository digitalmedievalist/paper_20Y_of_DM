manuscript illustrations (we're actually in the process of converting MARC
records and an internal database of illustration descriptions into TEI
msDesc). Although msDesc is "manuscript description" the definition,
"contains a description of a single identifiable manuscript or other
text-bearing object," so it can be used to describe printed books.If TEI isn't your thing, you could use METS to describe the book structure,
with embedded VRA to describe illustrations, I think.DotOn Wed, Sep 17, 2014 at 3:47 AM, Franz Fischer <franz.fischer(a)uni-koeln.de>

historian/medievalist and visual resource librarian, I am very interested
in how institutions are addressing and including metadata for images in
rare books and manuscripts which are being digitized. With the continual
growth of digital projects it an important area. It is fantastic to have
these wonderful collections digitized but a real frustration when image
data cannot be located. I am wondering how this group is addressing this
issue in their institutions? If you are addressing it, what schema for the
image metadata you are using? Ideally, we would all want to be heading
toward consistency and inter-collaborative schema for the sustainability of
these projects in the future.

>> HI,
>>
>> I am currently migrating projects to a new server and have encountered
difficulties with the Thomas L. Gravell Watermarks Archive database. As is
summarized below, we have moved everything, confirmed that we can update a
MySQL database on the new server using FMP and the ODBC driver, but the
Gravell database itself is not communicating, despite updating scripts,
etc. Has anyone on the list had recent experience with these issues? One
problem is that it has been awhile since we have had to deal with a
migration and there are some rusty chops! Thanks in advance for any
insights. Here's the summary from my tech person:
>>
>> - Moved the MySQL database to the new server. Verified that the database
user has all privileges to manage the database.
>>
>> - Verified that Port 3306 is open so the database can be managed
remotely.
>>
>> - Installed the Actual Technologies ODBC Driver, created a new DSN for
the MySQL database, and verified that we can connect to the MySQL database
using ODBC.
>>
>> - Updated the FileMaker Pro scripts to use the new DSN we created.
>>
>> I can confirm that the MySQL database can be modified in FileMaker Pro
via ODBC (I created a new FileMaker Pro database to test this), but
something in the scripts in the existing FileMaker Pro database is
preventing the ODBC connection from working.
