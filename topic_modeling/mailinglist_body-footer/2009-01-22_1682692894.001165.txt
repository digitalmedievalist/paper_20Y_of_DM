issue on the lessons learned from pre-web digital medieval projects.
The editors have compiled a list of scholars we will be inviting to
submit articles for this issue, however we feel the list as it stands
is rather Anglo-centric. We are turning to the list to suggest
potential authors - either scholars who themselves developed pre-web
projects, or who have studied such projects with an historical view.
We would especially like the names of non-US, non-Canadian, and
non-English scholars. Please send suggestions to the DM list, or
directly to the DM Editorial Board (editors(a)digitalmedievalist.org).Many thanks,
Dot--
