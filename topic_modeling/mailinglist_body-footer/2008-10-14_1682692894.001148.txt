refer to the extent to which humanists now need to know something about
the "new digital genres". By that I mean the things that if you have
been traditionally trained and were bookish rather than videogamish or
technologically oriented as a teenager, you might not know much about:blogs
wikis
MOOs and MUDs and other text-based games (an older genre, I know)
SIMs and other immersive game-like environments (ranging from second
life through doom)Others? Corrections? I'm trying to think how to get something with GPS
in there.-dan--
