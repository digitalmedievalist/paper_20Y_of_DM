*Global Digital Humanities Symposium*March 21-22, 2019MSU, Main Library, Green Room*msuglobaldh.org <http://msuglobaldh.org>*Call for Proposals*Deadline: November 18**Proposal form*Digital Humanities at Michigan State University is proud to extend its
symposium series on Global DH into its fourth year. Digital humanities
scholarship continues to be driven by work at the intersections of a range
of distinct disciplines and an ethical commitment to preserve and broaden
access to cultural materials.Focused on these issues of social justice, we invite work at the
intersections of critical DH; race and ethnicity; feminism,
intersectionality, and gender; and anti-colonial and postcolonial
frameworks to participate.Given the growth of these fields within the digital humanities,
particularly in under-resourced and underrepresented areas, a number of
complex issues surface, including, among others, questions of ownership,
cultural theft, virtual exploitation, digital rights, *endangered data*,
and the digital divide. DH communities have raised and responded to these
issues, pushing the field forward. We view the 2019 symposium as an
opportunity to broaden the conversation about these issues. Scholarship
that works across borders with foci on transnational partnerships and
globally accessible data is especially welcome. Additionally, we define the
term "humanities" rather broadly to incorporate the discussion of issues
that encourage interdisciplinary understanding of the humanities.This symposium, which will include a mixture of presentation types,
welcomes 300-word proposals related to any of these issues, and
particularly on the following themes and topics by *Sunday, November 18,
midnight anytime:*·       Critical cultural studies and analytics·       Cultural heritage in a range of contexts·       DH as socially engaged humanities and/or as a social movement·       Open data, open access, and data preservation as resistance,
especially in a postcolonial context·       DH responses to crisis·       How identity categories, and their intersections, shape digital
humanities work·       Global research dialogues and collaborations·       Indigeneity – anywhere in the world – and the digital·       Digital humanities, postcolonialism, and neocolonialism·       Global digital pedagogies·       Borders, migration, and/or diaspora and their connection to the
digital·       Digital and global languages and literatures·       The state of global digital humanities community·       Digital humanities, the environment, and climate change·       Innovative and emergent technologies across institutions,
languages, and economies·       Scholarly communication and knowledge production in a global context·       Surveillance and/or data privacy issues in a global context*Presentation Formats:*·       5-minute lightning talk·       15-minute presentation·       90-minute workshop·       90-minute panel·       There will be a limited number of slots available for 15-minute
virtual presentationsPlease note that we conduct a double-blind review process, so please
