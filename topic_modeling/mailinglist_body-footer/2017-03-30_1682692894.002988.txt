ce Of Pre-Modern European ManuscriptsHundreds of thousands of pre-modern European manuscripts have survived until =
the present day. As the result of changes in their ownership over the centuri=
es, they are now spread all over the world. Collectively they constitute a gr=
eat cultural and scholarly treasure. There are many sources of data relating =
to them, and new sources continue to proliferate in the digital environment. =
This project will link disparate datasets from Europe and North America to pr=
ovide an international view of the history and provenance of these manuscript=
s. The aggregated data will enable researchers to analyse and visualize these=
 topics at scales ranging from individual manuscripts to thousands of manuscr=
ipts. Our research will address their origins and movements, and the collecto=
rs and owners involved in their history. We will be able to show how these ma=
nuscripts have traveled across time and space to their current locations, whe=
re they continue to find new audiences.The project will run from 2017 to 2019, as part of the Digging into Data Chal=
lenge, which is funded by 16 funding bodies in 11 countries through the Trans=
-Atlantic Platform.The Principal Investigators are:
Toby Burrows, University of Oxford, United Kingdom, AHRC/ESRC
Eero Hyv√∂nen, Aalto University, Finland, AKA
Lynn Ransom, University of Pennsylvania, United States, IMLS
Hanno Wijsman, Institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes, France, ANRhttps://diggingintodata.org/awards/2016/project/mapping-manuscript-migrations=
