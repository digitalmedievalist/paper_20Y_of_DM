far: I think it's a good idea to move the main site to Wordpress, and I
also think it's a good idea to move the journal to another system (I know
we've been in talks with revues.org, we might also consider Indiana
University Bloomington's set-up which uses Open Journal System, they
publish The Medieval Review and many other journals as well, although I
don't know if there is anyone at IUB who would be willing to act as contact
for that). Off the shelf technology has improved vastly in the years since
DM was founded, and there's no reason for us not to take advantage of that
(rather than playing sysadmin and building code from scratch - which can be
fun, but is time consuming)I think it would be great to have some kind of place to serve the type of
information that the wiki has traditionally served - definitions of terms,
lists of projects and tools, that kind of thing. Something that isn't well
served by a blog-type interface, or even a regular website organization. I
agree with Gabby that actually merging DM into the Digital Classicist wiki
is probably not the best approach, because (let's be honest), medieval
studies isn't classics. We could do well to learn from them however -
having a closed wiki would help with the spam, and focusing on new methods
for getting data into the wiki (as DC is organizing wiki sprints). I wonder
if there's another type of site, not a wiki, that could be used for the
same purpose? I can't think of anything.My $.02 fwiwDot
