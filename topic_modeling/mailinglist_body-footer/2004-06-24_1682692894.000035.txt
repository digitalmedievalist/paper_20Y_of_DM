character palette performs both of these functions. If your system has 
a font that contains a glyph in a specific category (say, Runic Letter 
Y, under Runic), that character will display as present (if not, an 
empty box appears). Clicking on a character shown to be present then 
opens all the individual font presentations (including bold, italic, 
etc.) of that character in a window below; so if you have three fonts 
that contain Runic Letter Y, you can know this instantly, and see what 
they each look like, and then choose to insert one into your current 
application. 
To compliment a "pan-Unicode" approach,  the Glyph Catalog feature 
allows you to examine individual font offerings, displaying all 
characters available in a specific font.Unless I'm missing something, there does seem to be some wonkiness 
with this feature and Junicode, however. The Glyph Catalog (which 
allows you to examine all characters available in a specific font) 
indicates that the Junicode runes are only available in Junicode Bold. 
The Unicode Block feature indicates only  Junicode Regular contains 
these characters, but displays them (as I mentioned in another post) 
incorrectly as vertical lines.best,~ Martin Foys
