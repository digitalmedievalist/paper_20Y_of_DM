Ruthwell cross as part of the Visionary Cross project.If you are interested in following what's going on while we are on site, 
we will be tweeting and posting photos using the hashtag 
#visionarycross. Blog entries, photos, and tweets will also be available 
at http://www.visionarycross.org/This website was put together by some students on the basis of the 
original funding applications and will be fairly low-level for most of 
the people on this list. Now that we are beginning to get new data, 
we'll be updating it with better bibliography, photos, and the like as 
they become available.The team will be assembling in Ruthwell and setting up on Monday and 
Tuesday. Scanning and photographic work should be happening Wednesday 
through Friday. On site will be James Graham (New Media, Lethbridge), 
Heather Hobma (Lethbridge graduate student), Catherine Karkow (Art 
History, Leeds) Roberto Rosselli Del Turco (Linguistics, Turin), the CNR 
scanning team (Marco Callieri and Matteo Dellepiane), and myself. Our 
fellow team member Wendy Osborn (Computer Science, Lethbridge) will be 
in Lethbridge.Please feel free to look up the site periodically next week to see the 
scanning in action!This work is being funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research 
Council and the University of Lethbridge.--
