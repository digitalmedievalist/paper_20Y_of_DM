"problem": the breathtaking increase in the number of medieval =20
manuscripts available on the web in their entirety, but in a =20
bewildering range of venues and formats.Currently, almost one thousand manuscripts, digitized and available in =20
their entirety on the web, have been entered into the Catalogue.   =20
Users can search the Catalogue on basic information about manuscripts, =20
such as the location, language, or date of a codex, or browse through =20
