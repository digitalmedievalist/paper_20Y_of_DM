Subject: 	encoding maps, graphics with text?
Date: 	Tue, 6 Jul 2004 16:15:23 -0400
From: 	Julia Flanders <Julia_Flanders(a)BROWN.EDU>
Reply-To: 	Julia Flanders <Julia_Flanders(a)BROWN.EDU>
To: 	TEI-L(a)LISTSERV.BROWN.EDUDoes anyone know of any projects which are using the TEI to encode
materials that have substantial graphical content as well as text,
e.g. maps, diagrams, that sort of thing? I'm interested in ways of
making explicit linkages between specific locations in a digitized
image and specific chunks of text in the encoded transcription.Many thanks! Julia
