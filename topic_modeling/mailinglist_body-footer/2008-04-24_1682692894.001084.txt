 Electronic Resources
 Hosted by the Western Michigan University Libraries' Digitization Center Friday, May 9, 1:30-5:00 The process of digitization project planning is essential for
 endeavors large and small. Every project to digitize medieval primary
 sources, whether undertaken by major libraries or by individual
 scholars, must take into account issues of legality (can I post these
 digital images on the web?), equipment (can I use a flatbed scanner,
 or should I use a camera?), specifications (300 or 600 dpi? And what's
 dpi??) and metadata standards (what's metadata?). Our seminar,
 "Elements of Digitization Project Planning" will describe why a
 Digitization Project Plan is essential for every project, and will go
 over what each element of a project plan entails. We will discuss the
 nine elements of successful project planning, and show resources and
 references for developing digitization project plans. Experienced
 professionals, including librarians and image experts, will share
 their expertise and provide examples of previous successful project
 plans. We will also cover other important aspects of digitization
 technology, including the methodology and technology of digital
 preservation. Registration is $50 for MAA members and $65 for non-members.
 To register, contact Dot Porter at dporter(a)uky.edu.
 Space is limited to 35. --
