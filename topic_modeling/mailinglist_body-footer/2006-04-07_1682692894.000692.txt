Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitDaniel, that article in Heroic Age is really first-rate: an excellent 
presentation which everyone in our field should read.As one who wrote for a very specific and now practically non-existent 
system (PLATO) -- I don't mind so much that the cAI has gone, but 6-8 
years of my research went down the tubes and had to be re-constituted. 
I think I have finally caught up, but it was exhausting.  But I do want 
to say that all the caveats you presented about writing and presentation 
in your article apply to humanities computer-aided research as well.--===============1948138745794260567==--
