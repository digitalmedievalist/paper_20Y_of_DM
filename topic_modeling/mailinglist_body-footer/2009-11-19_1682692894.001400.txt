created or even "ran" the feed, it was just a tag that people used. The 
TEIMM website proposed a tag, and people followed it, but it would 
probably have happened without the suggestion (possible various tags 
would have been suggested, and all but one would have died out within 
the first day or so). Anyone who reads the feed and thinks that it's 
anything but a collection of what *anyone* in the world chooses to say 
and self-identify with the #tei_09 tag is misunderstanding not only 
Twitter but the way Web 2.0 works. Not only can we not control this, but 
nor should we be able to and nor should we want to.(This same method was used at DH09, and at several other conferences 
I've attended and/or run, and has been a very useful way to collect 
reviews and discussions afterwards. If there was trolling or tweckling 
at tei_09 [I haven't seen it, and I suspect we shouldn't dredge it up 
here if there was], there certainly wasn't at any of the other hashtags 
I've followed.)I'm all for experiment and careful thought, but let's not (a) panic, nor 
(b) think that this is in our hands. Abuse on the TEI-L or DM-L can (and 
should) be handled by the listowners, but Twitter is bigger than us. We 
just need to make clear that what happens under "our" hashtag is not 
actually our responsibility. In any way.In any case, as James points out, the DM account announced here is not a 
hashtag. As far as I can see, no one has tweeted anything under 
#digitalmedieval yet. (#digitalhumanities gets occasional hits, but I 
haven't seen any abuse there yet ;-) )Dan O'Donnell a Ã©crit :
