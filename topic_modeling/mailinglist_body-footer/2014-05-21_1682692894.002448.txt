val scholarship. So when I first began to consider which Wiki to contribute t=
o, DM or the Digital Classicist (wiki.digitalclassicist.org), I opted for the=
 latter because it had garnered the most contributions and was at the time th=
e most active. But I wondered at the time why medievalists and classicists re=
ally needed separate wikis anyway, since the material that was populating the=
 pages applied to any field studying pre-modernity. Material surfaces in both=
 spheres of exploration that could benefit any other. Thus, the "classicist" =
in "Digital Classicist" is not restricted to pre-2nd c. material; their wiki =
already has quite a lot of medieval and Byzantine content on it.So instead of altering the bylaws, why not simply have DM endorse either the =
DC wiki or a comparable one? Follow the road of collaboration?=20Best wishes,jk

Subject: [SPAM - Header] - [dm-l] Proposed Changes to DM - Email found in sub=
jectDear all,I apologise for the length of this e-mail, but I write regarding a series of =
fairly fundamental changes to the DM infrastructure that we have been plannin=
g for some time now. Given the scale of these changes, we on the DM Board thi=
nk it is important to explain these in some detail and request feedback from =
the Community before we go ahead with them. They will also require a change o=
f the Byelaws, and so again we need input from the Community for this.Unfortunately the existing infrastructure has proven unmanageable. The wiki a=
nd mailing-list have both been subject to large-scale spam attacks, such that=
 the wiki now contains many many thousands of articles, only 70 or so of whic=
h are genuine. The wiki has also had almost no activity beyond that of the Bo=
ard, and so it has not been doing the job that we had hoped. Furthermore the =
website itself, which we have been hosting and coding ourselves (with substan=
tial help from James Cummings and Dan O'Donnell) is also proving incr=
easingly difficult to manage: it depends on the generosity of James and Dan t=
o host and administer, even adding new pages is not trivial, and it has neede=
d a dramatic overhaul for some time but to do this requires much more time an=
d effort than we have been able to manage. For all of these reasons, we propo=
se the following:1. Moving the static website from the existing infrastructure (Cocoon + TEI +=
 custom XSLT) to a standard CMS (currently Wordpress).
2. Closing down the wiki entirely and replacing it with a blog.
3. For the moment we are leaving the Journal in place, but we are very likely=
 to move it to a dedicated open journal hosting of some sort. We have been di=
scussing this in some detail with Revues.org but are not yet committed to thi=
s.As most of you have realised, we have already set up a Wordpress version of t=
he site at <http://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com/>, and this is already pr=
oving to overcome the problems listed above. The proposal is therefore to mak=
e this the DM site and close down the old one, except perhaps for the Journal.However, the current Byelaws require that DM maintains a wiki (see <http://di=
gitalmedievalist.wordpress.com/about/byelaws/#wiki>). The Board is therefore =
not free to close the existing wiki without first changing the Byelaws. Even =
if we chose to keep the wiki, however, the Board feels that the Byelaws shoul=
d not lock us into using any single technology, and so they should be changed=
 even if we keep the existing infrastructure. The details of the proposed cha=
nges to the Byelaws will be posted shortly as a separate e-mail and on the ne=
w website, but in essence we propose simply to replace the term 'wiki' with '=
information resources' and to adapt the containing sentences accordingly.We would be grateful for any feedback about any aspect of this, preferably by=
 e-mail to the list for general discussion, or alternatively to board(a)digit=
almedievalist.org or any members of the Board directly. The next Board meetin=
g is 4pm GMT+1 on Monday 2 June, at which point any comments will be discusse=
d, and any changes in the Byelaws will be presented to the membership for vot=
e shortly after that (as specified in =C2=A79 of the Byelaws: <http://digital=
medievalist.wordpress.com/about/byelaws/#amendments>).Thank you, and we look forward to receiving your comments.Peter Stokes (on behalf of the Executive Board)--
