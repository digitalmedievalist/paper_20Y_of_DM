*Patrick J. Burns (New York University)
*Backoff Lemmatization for Ancient Greek with the Classical Language ToolkitAutomated lemmatization, or retrieval of dictionary headwords, is an active a=
rea of research in historical-language text analysis. In this talk, I describ=
e the development of the Backoff Lemmatizer for Ancient Greek with the Classi=
cal Language Toolkit (CLTK), an open-source Python platform dedicated to deve=
loping natural language processing tools for historical languages. The Backof=
f Lemmatizer seeks to improve on existing tools by combining training-data-ba=
sed and rules-based tagging as a lemmatization strategy. By way of conclusion=
, I discuss a current CLTK development strategy, namely the use of object-ori=
ented architecture as an avenue to digital comparative philology.Livestream: https://youtu.be/o0neelgQlw8Full abstract: http://digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2018.htmlALL WELCOME
