absurd, but the owner of the property has the right to restrict its use
any way he wishes.It's pity that the right is often overused in digital libraries. Recently
in Poland the access to almost 3 milions of scanned paper slips of the
Late Middle Polish dictionary (work in progress), which was free for
months, has been retracted without any explanation or justification...Best regardsJanusz--=20
