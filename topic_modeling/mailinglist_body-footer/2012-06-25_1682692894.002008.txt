that this is good sign for Digital Medievalist.For those who haven't looked at the ballot yet, the candidates are:Alexei Lavrentiev (ICAR, CNRS & Lyon University)
Barbara Bordalejo (University Saskatchewan)
Grant Simpson (Indiana University)
Orietta Da Rold (University of Leicester)
Takako Kato (De Montfort University)
Timoty Leonardi (Capitulary Library of Vercelli)
Toby Burrows (University of Western Australia)I think this shows a good spread (by geography, by discipline, and by
gender). And makes me confident about the future of Digital
Medievalist.As many of you know, I'm forbidden from running again by the bylaw
changes that I encouraged to be made last year setting a limit on
consecutive terms by board members. It has been a pleasure being
director of DM for the last 4 years.As such I would encourage you all to vote! There are 760 members of
the DM mailing list, and so far (ok, after not even 24 hours), only 25
have voted!It is a quick few clicks... Vote now! http://surveymonkey.com/s/DM-elections2012
