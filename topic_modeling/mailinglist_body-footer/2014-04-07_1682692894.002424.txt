Workshop
Deadline: 22 April 2014http://dhoxss.humanities.ox.ac.uk/2014/bursaries.htmlDigital Humanities at Oxford Summer School (DHOxSS) is one of the leading
international training events in Digital Humanities. It is for researchers,
project managers, research assistants, students, and anyone interested in
Digital Humanities. DHOxSS delegates are introduced to a range of topics
including the creation, management, analysis, modelling, visualization, or
publication of digital data in the humanities. Each delegate follows one of
our five-day workshops and supplements this with additional morning
parallel lectures. There will also be a (peer-reviewed) poster session
giving delegates a chance to present their Digital Humanities work to those
at the DHOxSS.This year's DHOxSS will be held on 14-18 July 2014 and the five-day
workshops offered are:1. Introduction to Digital Humanities
2. Taking Control: Practical Scripting for Digital Humanities Projects
3. Data Curation and Access for the Digital Humanities
4. A Humanities Web of Data: Publishing, Linking and Querying on the
Semantic Web
5. Using the Text Encoding Initiative for Digital Scholarly EditionsThe NeDiMAH project has sponsored up to 6 bursaries of up to EUR 500 each
for those attending the Humanities Web of Data workshop in particular (see
http://dhoxss.humanities.ox.ac.uk/2014/HumData.html). Applicants should be
early-career researchers in the humanities, and must be working in
participating NeDiMAH countries (see
http://www.nedimah.eu/Contributing-Organisations) and priority will be
given to applicants whose travel costs mean they would not otherwise be
able to attend. ‘Early-Career Researcher’ is defined as up to five years
post-phd (or equivalent).The DHOxSS will offer an excellent opportunity to gain knowledge and
participate in discussions about a wide range of digital techniques and
research methods, as well as exploring key topics in depth with leading
senior researchers and technologists.The application form asks for a description (max 250 words) of how
attending the Humanities Web of Data workshop in particular will benefit
your research. Applications are due by 22 April 2014. For more information
see: http://dhoxss.humanities.ox.ac.uk/2014/bursaries.html and for
