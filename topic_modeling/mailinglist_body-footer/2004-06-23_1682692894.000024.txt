Junicode appears to be mostly working -- from the character palette, I 
can find enter most of the usual suspects (eth, thorn, yogh -- not 
sure where the wynn is, though) and combine diacriticals no problem in 
Word 2004. However, not everything appears to be displaying properly 
in the OSX character palette. For the runes, for instance, all display 
as straight horizontal lines, though inserting one does insert the 
proper runic form into Word. ~ Martin
