Jan,as you rightly say, longevity is mainly about institutional structures=20
and committments. But take the example of the Herzog-August-Library in=20
Wolfenbüttel, Germany, a special collection and research library for the=
=20
17th century. With their digital library (and their series of digital=20
editions) they have made such a committment and they keep saying: we=20
have been here for the last 441 years and thus it's quite likely that we=20
will be here for the next centuries as well. And as we care for the=20
printed books in our collection, we will also care for the digital=20
information in our collection.And at least statements like these (which you can hear from other=20
libraries as well) make me slightly optimistic, that the stage of=20
uncertainty of digital information will come to an end through=20
institutional structures of preservation and care (based on the most=20
important thing: committment).A much weaker example (but still another example): some month ago, our=20
faculty for the humanities has established (by committment as well as by=20
allocating financial resources) a humanities data center with the clear=20
order to make research project results from the faculty enduring. That=20
means (at least): as long as this data center exists (and it will create=20
cooperative fallback-strategies fore worst case scenarios as well), it=20
will care for any digital edition that is created at the university.Best, PatrickAm 19.03.2013 09:07, schrieb Jan Burgers:
