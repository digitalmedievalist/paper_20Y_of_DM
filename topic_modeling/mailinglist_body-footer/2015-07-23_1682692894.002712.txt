Modeling semantically Enriched Digital Edition of Accounts (MEDEA)Account books have long been used as primary sources for economic and 
social history since they allow scholars to explore the development of 
economic behavior on both a macro- and micro-structural level. A number 
of projects in Europe and the United States have begun to explore models 
for digitizing such sources.The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) has developed useful models to encode 
texts and digital scholarly editions, and the semantic web offers 
opportunities to collect and compare data from multiple digital 
projects. The MEDEA project looks at these methods with the goal of 
developing broad standards for producing semantically enriched digital 
editions of accounts. It will foster discussion of benefits and 
deficiencies in existing standards by bringing together economic 
historians, scholarly editors, and technical experts to discuss and test 
the emerging methods for semantic markup of account books. For this 
purpose we call for contributions of scholars with experiences in the 
scholarly edition of historical financial records and ideas about how to 
use digital methods within this context.We invite proposals for participation in our first workshop, which will 
be held in *Regensburg (Germany), Oct. 22-24, 2015*. Participants will 
present current research projects using data from historical account 
books, describe the encoding models of their projects, and share ideas 
for a common model. The discussions and examples will focus on a set of 
questions intended to elucidate the features of accounts of greatest 
interest to scholars. Thus the activities will focus on the following 
issues:●     How might we model the economic activities recorded in these 
documents? In particular: What models of bookkeeping were followed 
historically and how can they be represented formally? Are data models 
developed for modern business reporting helpful?
●     How can we model the economic reality behind the texts? Can we 
establish common resources on metrics and currencies or even the value 
of money that can be reused in other projects? Is it possible to build 
common taxonomies of commodities and services to facilitate the 
comparison of financial information recorded at different places and 
times? That is, can we develop references on the order of name 
authorities and standards for geo-referencing?
●     How might we integrate topological information of the 
transcription with its financial interpretation? Is the “table” an 
appropriate method? What possibilities are offered by the TEI 
Manuscripts module and use of the tei:zone element?
●     How can we integrate a topological/documentary approach and the 
growing linguistic interest in the texts with the interpretations that 
economic and social historians extract from the documents?Proposals should not exceed 700 words and should be submitted to 
medea.workshop(a)ur.de by August 24, 2015.
The programme committee will assess the proposals and notify applicants 
no later than September 2, 2015.
We particularly encourage proposals from early-career researchers from 
Europe and from the United States. A limited budget is available to 
support costs of travel and accommodation.
If there remain any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.See more details on the project at http://medea.hypotheses.org/ .
