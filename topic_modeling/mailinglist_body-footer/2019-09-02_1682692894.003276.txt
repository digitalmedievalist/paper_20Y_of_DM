d statement is primarily justified by the observation that the application of=
 digital methods is triggered by a research community outside Medieval Studie=
s, i.e. Computer Science and New Media Studies. Therefore, in its interdiscip=
linary nature digital medieval studies is a border-crossing discipline and br=
eaks up traditionally developed scholarly silos and institutional borders. Th=
e experimentation with and application of new methods and technologies challe=
nges traditional perceptions and research approaches. Another kind of digital=
 boarders are "metadata borders". For example, digital cataloging standards c=
reate unintended, and sometimes intended borders and boundaries, that prevent=
 data-sharing and linking.In the light of this proposition the Digital Medievalist will take the opport=
unity of next years' general IMC theme ("Borders") to discuss cutting edge an=
d "border-crossing" digital methods and technologies and/or borders and bound=
aries caused by digital methods. Topics may include current research in machi=
ne learning, computer vision, 3D modeling, IIIF, multispectral imaging, Handw=
ritten Text Recognition, Linked Data and distant reading, etc. Machine learni=
ng, for instance, poses specific problems for Medieval Studies, as its succes=
s depends on the availability, findability, reusability, and accessibility of=
 large amounts of data. Similar issues exist with the application of other di=
gital methods to medieval material and the session(s) "Digital Borders of Med=
ieval Studies" will be the place to present and discuss them.The Digital Medievalist community invites the submission of proposals for 20-=
minutes papers covering a topic relating to the session title and focusing on=
 the application of digital methods and technologies for current and future r=
esearch in the field of Medieval Studies.Please send your proposal (300 Words incl. a short CV) to dm.imc2020(a)gmail.=
com by Sept. 15th.
