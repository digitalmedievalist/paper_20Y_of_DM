ongoing spam attack. Currently it is accessible only from the University
of Lethbridge campus, while we track down and remove the offenders.Sorry for any inconvenience. I'm hoping it won't take more than a day:
the changes are pretty comprehensive and we will need to find a way of
keeping spammers out.-dan
