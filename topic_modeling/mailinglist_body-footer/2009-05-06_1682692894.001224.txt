Venue: Oxford University Computing ServicesFull information and online booking:
http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/rts/events/2009-07/This five-day course combines in-depth coverage of the latest version
of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines for the encoding of
digital text with hands-on practical exercises in their application.
If you are a project manager, research assistant, or encoder working
on any kind of project concerned with the creation or management of
digital text, this course is for you.You should be generally computer literate (web, email,
word-processors) for this course. You may already be broadly familiar
with the idea of textual editing, perhaps (but not necessarily) with
some experience of producing HTML web pages, or of traditional
scholarly editing. You should be enthusiastic about the possibilities
offered by digital technologies and keen to learn more. You should be
prepared to get your hands dirty at the keyboard and you should not be
afraid of a little technical jargon.At the end of the course we hope to have given you:  1. a good grounding in the theoretical issues underlying the use of
     text markup, XML in particular;
  2. an understanding of the purpose and principles of the Text
     Encoding Initiative;
  3. a survey of the full range of modules constituting the TEI's
     current Recommendations;
  4. experience of how the TEI scheme can be customized for particular
     applications, and internationalized for different languages.
  5. an introduction to some of the tools and methods in which TEI
     documents are published and processedUsing OUCS' excellent teaching facilities, we will also provide you
with practical experience in:   * using online tools to build, verify, and document a TEI-conformant
     schema
   * using XML editing software to
         o create new encoded texts
         o standardize existing digital texts
   * using a variety of web-based and desktop tools to display and
     analyse TEI documentsThe course will be taught by the TEI(a)Oxford team: Lou Burnard, James
Cummings, and Sebastian Rahtz, with the assistance of other invited
TEI experts.--
