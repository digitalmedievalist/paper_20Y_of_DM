Manuscripts at MichiganColleagues,The University of Michigan Library is pleased to invite your =20
participation in our ongoing CLIR-funded project, "Collaboration in =20
Cataloging: Islamic Manuscripts at Michigan," by way of our newly =20
launched project website:http://www.lib.umich.edu/islamic/The project website is at the center of an approach that provides =20
access to bibliographic records and digital surrogates for the Islamic =20
manuscripts; facilitates the gathering of informative and insightful =20
commentary from scholars on campus, across the country, and around the =20
world; and exposes in real time the dynamic enrichment of =20
bibliographic information as project staff, scholars, and other =20
contributors interact with the system. By involving the widest =20
possible scholarly community in the iterative enrichment of manuscript =20
descriptions, our project makes the best possible use of an aggregate =20
of expertise that is uniquely positioned to help us overcome the =20
challenges inherent in traditional manuscript cataloguing.The Islamic Manuscripts Collection at the University of Michigan =20
contains approximately 1,100 manuscript volumes mainly in Arabic, =20
Persian, and Turkish and dating from roughly the 8th to the 20th =20
century CE. A limited amount of descriptive information for the =20
manuscripts has already been gathered and converted to preliminary =20
records in our online library catalogue. Likewise, the manuscripts are =20
being digitized with their digital versions appearing in the Hathi =20
Trust Digital Library. The existing descriptive information is =20
currently being enhanced as the project cataloguer and staff examine =20
the manuscripts (both physically and in the digital environment) and =20
use a research approach to assemble as rich and analytical a =20
description as possible for each manuscript.We invite you to join us in the examination and description of the =20
manuscripts and to submit the results of your analysis as comments via =20
our project website. Your contributions will be reviewed by the =20
project cataloguer and refashioned for incorporation into the =20
cataloguing records for the manuscripts you examine. Additionally, =20
your contribution will be recognized both on the site and in the =20
record for the manuscript that appears in our library catalogue.We look forward to seeing your comments posted to the project site and =20
thank you in advance for your valuable contribution to this project.Further information on the project is available here:http://www.lib.umich.edu/special-collections-library/clir-islamic-manuscripts=
-projectYou may browse records of all the Islamic manuscripts in our catalogue at:http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Search/Home?filter%5B%5D=3Dlocation%3ASPEC%20ISLM=
&page=3D1&use_dismax=3D1And all manuscripts which have been digitized are viewable here:http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/mb?a=3Dlistis;c=3D1961411403Please forward any questions, comments, and/or suggestions to project =20
staff at islamic.manuscripts(a)umich.edu.
