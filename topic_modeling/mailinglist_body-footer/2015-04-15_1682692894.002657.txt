Published before 1501, the first printed editions, known as incunabula, first=
 captured the interest of booklovers, researchers, and librarians three centu=
ries ago. Today, knowledge of the output from these first fifty years is more=
 widespread as a result of national and international bibliographical researc=
h. An inventory of some 30,000 incunabular books has been compiled, represent=
ing around fifty million copies that circulated over a period of roughly fift=
y years. This summer school aims to increase the participants' awareness of t=
he issues surrounding the description, cataloguing and digitisation of incuna=
bula. It is intended to highlight the interest of a scientific approach, for =
example by focussing on the conditions in which they were produced and on the=
ir content, as well as by reconstructing their journey to the present day thr=
ough the study of their bindings and marks of origin.=20Target Audience=20    * Students : any French or international student who will hold a Master=
