With apologies for the cross posting and with a request to please forward
along to other lists and groups.Call for ParticipationWe are inviting applications to participate in the TEI Hackathon full day
workshop that will be held on July 7, 2014, as a pre-conference session at
DH2014 (http://dh2014.org/).
Digital humanists, librarians, publishers, and many others use the Text
Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines to mark up electronic texts, and over
time have created a critical mass of XML — some conforming to known subsets
of the TEI Guidelines, some to individual customizations; in some cases
intricate and dense, in others lean and expedient; some enriched with
extensive external  metadata, others with details marked explicitly in the
text. The fruits of this labor are most often destined for display online
or on paper (!), indexing, and more rarely, visualisation. Techniques of
processing this markup beyond display and indexing are less well-understood
and not accessible to the broad community of users, however, and
programmers sometimes regard TEI XML as over-complex and hard to process.What We’ll DoThe goal of the hackathon is to make significant progress on a few projects
during one day of work (from 9am to roughly 5.30pm).Possible projects might include but are not limited to:* applying visualisation to TEI documents or schemas/ODDs (e.g. visualizing
the TEI conceptual model)
* mining a large corpus of texts for some data facet and visualising the
results
* rendering complex markup in an innovative and playful way
* writing input or output filters for existing bits of software
* extending existing TEI software to take advantage of external resources
such as Zotero
* adding a TEI mode to a web editor
* Programming for multilingual resourcesAll participants will begin discussing the projects that have been proposed
before the hackathon, and select a small number to be worked on. More
concrete discussion about tools and specs will take place before the date
of the hackathon so participants can hit the ground running during the
hackathon. On the day of the hackathon, participants will form groups, and
work on their projects. Workshop organizers and invited experts will be on
hand to consult on TEI details and strategies of dealing with them.The organisers will provide refreshments during the day, will make sample
texts available if needed, and will help with software setup where
possible. Participants will need to bring their own laptop computersParticipantsThis workshop is intended for reasonably experienced DH practitioners, who
may not hitherto have experimented with TEI XML, as well as those who have
already been using TEI and developing TEI tools. If you don’t fall into
either of these categories, but you have a project that is appropriate for
the hackathon, please apply or contact us directly.Application processApplicants will email their application with the following information to
hackathon(a)tei-c.org.   Name
   Affiliation
   Contact information (email)
   Skills and experience (to help select projects)
   One or two suggested projects. These don’t have to be described in great
detail, as they will be discussed and shaped further in June.Deadline: Midnight (EST) April 17 (applications received after this date
will be considered on a rolling basis only if space remains available)Notification: by April 30The selection will be carried out by the programme committee based on
variety of expertise, interest in challenges with broad application,
geographical and gender balance.Organizers and ExpertsPlease don’t hesitate to contact the organizers if you have any questions.Programme committee:Hugh Cayless (hugh.cayless(a)duke.edu), TEI Technical Council - Research
programmer for the Duke Collaboratory for Classics ComputingArianna Ciula (ariananciula(a)roehampton.ac.uk), TEI Board of Directors -
Research Facilitator (Humanities) at the University of RoehamptonJames Cummings (james.cummings(a)it.ox.ac.uk), TEI Technical Council (chair)
-  Senior Digital Research Specialist in Academic IT at University of
Oxford’s IT ServicesElli Mylonas  (elli.mylonas(a)brown.edu), TEI Technical Council - Senior

Digital Scholarship GroupAlexander Czmiel, researcher in Digital Humanities at the
Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities
Follow upParticipants will have the option of applying for a grant of up to $1000
from the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium to allow them to finish their
work and make it available to others. Details for this competition will be
provided after the workshop has taken place.This workshop is being sponsored by the TEI Consortium (
http://www.tei-c.org/) which will provide lunch, coffee and snacks.
Thank you,
