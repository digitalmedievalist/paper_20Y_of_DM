Academy of America will add a Digital Humanities Prize to its suite of
publication honors, to be awarded alongside the Haskins Medal, the Brown
Prize, and the Elliott Prize. The annual Medieval Academy of America
Digital Humanities Prize will be awarded to an outstanding digital
research project in Medieval Studies created and launched within the
last five years. The Prize – an award of $1,000 – will be presented at
the Medieval Academy of America’s Annual Meeting.The Digital Initiatives Advisory Board (DIAB) of the Medieval Academy of
America will select the award-winning project based on DIAB’s
established criteria for high-quality digital medievalist projects,
considering the following criteria, among others: quality of research
and contributions to Medieval Studies; goals and methodologies of the
project; design, presentation, and accessibility of the project;
sustainability of the project and compatibility of its metadata.Nominations are now being accepted online and must be submitted by
midnight on October 15. Click here[1] for more information about the
MAA DH Prize.Links:  1. http://www.medievalacademy.org/general/custom.asp?page=DHPrize--===============0967897089433500387==
