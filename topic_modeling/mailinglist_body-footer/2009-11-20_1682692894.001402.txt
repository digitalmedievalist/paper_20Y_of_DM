reasons beyond our control, while all academic societies (like TEI and
DM) should do their best to minimise any major sources of anxiety for
people, I don't believe it should be a major concern of them to cater
for everyone's fear and paranoia.  I think it is a myth that twitter
somehow opens up new way to provide public comment and criticism.
During a paper one could easily email a mailing list and say "Dot is
talking about yet another image viewer/navigator, why do funding
bodies *keep* funding the same thing again and again?!" Or one could
put it in a blog... and blogging conferences is quite common.  If Dot
were then somehow offended by this, then she could of course answer
this criticism (to point out that the TILE project is really more
about Text/Image linking in my example).  But in my opinion we should
avoid attempting to shield people from comment and criticism; we do
them and the field a disservice. I'd be tempted to posit that without
forums for causing disagreement and possibly offence that an academic
field would stagnate. Obviously I'm not suggesting we just all go out
and vilify each other, but there certainly is an academic benefit in
pointing out the emperor seems to be a tad scantly dressed.   As a
comedian I went to see recently  when discussing attempts to legislate
to prevent hurt feelings commented something along the lines of: "What
ever happened to 'sticks and stones may break your bones but words
will never hurt you', if you are offended by what I say, then _fine_
be offended, that is your right. But nothing really _happens_ to you
when you are offended, it isn't like I've pushed you down the stairs,
if you don't like what I've said then just vote with your feet!".At a recent conference (DRHA in Belfast) I specifically followed the
tweets by one particular person because he was being blunt and honest.
 He was outraged by the waste of his tax revenue being spent by JISC
on the development of software that already existed in countless
forms, and scathing when people presented the same project they'd
presented four years ago with almost no difference in content, but
equally lauded those papers which had something new and interesting to
say.  It made attending other parallel sessions much more enjoyable.
I remember one person expressing regret that the person in question
had attended another session instead of theirs -- they *wanted* the
honest blunt feedback that everyone else would hide behind meek
assertions that the paper went 'fine' or tweets that just described
what the person had said.> I was shocked at the TEI to learn that people find contributing to listservs

rough-and-tumble, but plenty of people were nice to me and helped me.
I think the TEI list these days is actually a really nice and pleasant
list compared to some, so while I'm not shocked that people are
sometimes intimidated by the idea of posting to mailing lists, the TEI
one is so much better than it once was and so much better than some
other mailing lists.  It goes without saying, I hope, that the DM-L
mailing list is similarly a nice friendly place when we occasionally
break out into conversation.  I certainly hope that no one feels that
they can't contribute to any conversation on DM-L or start new ones!
Please do! I'd like to hear from more people I *don't* already know!> I don't think that there is anything to be done about twitter

people were honest with me.  They were in the questions afterwards:
"Why didn't you just use software X", and I replied "Well because it
does something different, here is why..."  During the #tei_09
conference there were 3 tweets about my paper all by the same nice
person, but all just descriptive of what I was saying, no critical
feedback one way or another.  (All the people doing that kind of thing
were in the other parallel session, which sounded quite interesting!)
In most cases, most of the tweets were just like this, descriptive of
what was going on with occasionally some additional comment.  If the
person in my session had complained that the paper was just a basic
description of what the software does and why we made it, then well,
they'd have been right, because that was the paper I chose to give!
Even if they'd been viciously cruel about the paper and my method of
presenting, I would have shrugged it off as one person's opinion, but
tried to do better in the future.  I wonder if a 'tweet' flame-war
results in roasted poultry of some sort.
Sorry for rambling on so much about this! Feel free to criticise that
on any twitter account you have. ;-)-James

better.)
