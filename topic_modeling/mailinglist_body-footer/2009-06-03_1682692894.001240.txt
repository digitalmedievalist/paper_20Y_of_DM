Opuscula: Short Texts of the Middle Ages and RenaissanceAbout the JournalOpuscula is a new high-quality peer-reviewed, on-line journal/text 
series published by Classical, Medieval and Renaissance Studies at the 
University of Saskatchewan and specializing in short texts of the Middle 
Ages and Renaissance. We seek submissions from scholars of a wide 
variety of disciplines and will include a diverse range of texts, 
including literature, philosophy, letters, charters, court documents, 
and notebooks.The goal of the journal is to establish open access to a substantial 
body of small but complete texts in scholarly editions to researchers 
and educators. Our first issue will be published in September 2010.Submissions
                                  
Editions should generally be based on single witnesses although critical 
editions may be considered.  Where texts are not English, translations 
may be appropriate but are not necessary. Texts should generally be 
under 6000 words in length, and each must be accompanied by an 
introduction in English of approximately 1500 words that provides 
historical, literary, and bibliographic context and codicological and 
palaeographic (or typographic) description. New editions of previously 
edited pieces may be considered but only if there are compelling reasons.All submissions will be subject to a double-blind review process and 
submissions for review must include facsimiles of any base manuscripts.For more information regarding submissions or to propose a text, contact:Frank Klaassen, General Editor
