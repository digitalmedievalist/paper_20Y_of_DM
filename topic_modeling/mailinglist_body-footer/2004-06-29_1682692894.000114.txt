Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7biti've been waiting to see if someone was going to reply to dan's 
suggestion last week about a wiki. after reading dan's post about 
publishing, open access, and community standards, i had been thinking 
that a wiki might be a good idea for this community.is the lack of response a rejection of the idea? or is it more about 
people being unfamiliar with wikis?in any case, it seems like a good topic to discuss. it might be a good 
public service for this list to put together a FAQ, as well. i know 
that's very 80s/90s usenet, but also at least worth thinking about, 
especially as more and more links to resources are posted to the list.dan: is it possible to get lethbridge to add search functionality to 
the list archives? that might help with keeping all this collective 
knowledge accessible down the road. just a thought.cheers,jjeffrey fisher
