now online (and has been online for a while):http://www.leeds.ac.uk/ims/imc/imc2011_call.htmlSession proposals are due on September 30. The DM board typically organizes
conference sessions, but before we do so this year we wanted to ask you all
if there is anyone amongst you (perhaps one or more someones) who would like
to be involved. If you have an idea for a session, or would like to organize
one, if you have an idea and would like to co-opt the DM name, please
respond to the list (or if you're shy, you can write me privately:
dot.porter(a)gmail.com).The theme of next year's conference will be "Poor...Rich." From the
description on the website: "As the global economy attempts to recover from
the recent staggering economic downturn, and scholars and journalists
describe the enormously uneven concentrations of wealth that took place in
the decade preceding that downturn, it seems only natural to turn our
scholarly gaze to issues of wealth and poverty in the Middle Ages." I'm not
sure how the theme could be applied to a digital session (suggestions?), but
in any case non-thematic session proposals are always welcome.Thanks,
Dot--
