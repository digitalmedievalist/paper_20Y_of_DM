Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThis is true about TeX and LaTeX. There is no better typesetting 
available unless you go to high-end typesetting systems. And it's worth 
pointing out that even an implementation that doesn't do Unicode can 
still do a great deal, for LaTeX does a great job of positioning 
diacritics, and there are good IPA and Greek packages available. For the 
last few years of typesetting The Year's Work in Old English Studies I 
used LaTeX with my own font package and IPA and Greek packages, and I 
never came across a situation the system couldn't handle. It would be 
easy to produce a script to generate perfectly decent LaTeX code and a 
beautiful PDF file.I must say, though, Peter, that this isn't the first time you've 
mentioned things that XSL can't do. I'm not sure I believe that it can't 
be done. Someday, when we've all got lots of time, we'll have to have a 
programming shootout. You can offer up a problem that you think XSL 
can't handle, and you code it in C (or whatever it is you use), and I'll 
use XSLT, and we'll see who gets there first.PeterPeter Robinson wrote:>To follow this up: on at least one operating system, matters are rather
