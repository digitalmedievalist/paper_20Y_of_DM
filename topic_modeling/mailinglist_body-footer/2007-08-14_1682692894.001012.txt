texs in order to determine specific use of sources?  Ideally, the software
would recognize a base text and then compare it to other texts that are
potential sources.I know of software applications like Collate that does some basic
comparative work in order to create an apparatus criticus for critical
editions, or the "authorship" testing software that Peter Miliken at Leeds
developed using stylometrics (which only outputs statistical results and no
textual output).  But I am looking for software that would compare units of
texts (such as sentence to sentence) and one--here's the kicker--that might
also work with an inflected language like Latin (so that it would include
returns that differ only in terms of case ending).   I know that's a tall
order, and I have my doubts that something like this exists--but I thought
someone on this list might know of some code kicking around in somebody's
virtual basement.Many thanks,
Jim
