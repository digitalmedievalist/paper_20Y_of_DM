(http://web-linux.unisi.it/tdtc/digimed/) held last week in Arezzo - Italy. The University of Siena-Arezzo (specifically the Dipartimento di Teoria e
Documentazione delle Tradizioni Culturali and the Centro Interdipantimentale
di Studi sui Beni Librari e Archivistici) and the Centre for Computing in
the Humanities, King's College London were involved as European partners
(together with the Italian foundation Fondazione Ezio Franceschini) in the
organisation of the international seminar entitled "Digital Philology and
Medieval Texts". The event has been successful on different levels and from different
perspectives: -          first of all the programme itself was rich and combined both
scholars presenting the most advanced humanities computing approaches to
philology and scholars keen on the traditional methods of philology.Many presentations and discussions revealed that the latter - the
traditional methods of philology  - are very much perceived as not
adequately represented by the available digital resources and tools. In some
cases, these critics are the results of a basic misunderstanding: is up to
the philologist as such to develop a "proper" (whatever this means for the
editor itself) digital edition. The dichotomy between "us" as philologists
and "you" as computer scientists or whoever else is never fruitful as we all
know.However, it is necessary to acknowledge that digital philology as a
discipline is not mature at all both in principles - as the debates at the
conference stressed out - and in practices (where the discipline itself
seems to enlarge and become a "transdiscipline"). Some talks though excelled
in showing that this is not always true. Ambitions are high both in the
development of new tools and in the contextualisation of the discipline in a
specific theoretical framework.-          the attendance was very much over the organisers' expectations
and most importantly, besides the big names in the field, featured a crowd
of young people (undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as young
researches from all over Italy and, in some cases, from other European
countries).Their subscriptions to the workshop exceeded the available seats. However,
they didn't intervene at the open discussion itself. What does this mean?
Would the debate been different if lead by a younger generation? Do they
prefer doing rather than talking? Do they privilege the direct experience
and then model the theory on it? Do they see less the discrepancies and more
the challenges?-          the debate at the round table was passionate and stimulating.Being all compressed in one afternoon, the discussion became rather abstract
and intense, detached from the single presentations. Rather than concentrate
on the single implementation and ideas, the juice of the substantial issues
came out leaving the audience, or at least me, immobilised by the flood.-          even if dominated by the Italian language, the multilingual (and
multicultural) aspect of the conference emerged during the presentations,
the discussions and the social moments, reminding us of a wider challenge
beyond the one of digital philology itself.Another occasion for creating bounds and think of future collaborations. Some of the materials related to the presentations are already available on
the conference website.  All the best, Arianna
