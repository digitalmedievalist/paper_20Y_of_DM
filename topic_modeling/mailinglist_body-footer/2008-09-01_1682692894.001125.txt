dia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance=20
), which might work for you.  You'd have to figure out whether the =20
defaults work for you or whether you'd have to figure out your own.You might look for any work on phonetic algorithms (http://en.wikipedia.org/w=
iki/Phonetic_algorithm=20
) for Latin.  I'm not aware of any.HOn Sep 1, 2008, at 8:01 AM, Dot Porter wrote:> [apologies for the slightly redundant subject line. It's not even =20
