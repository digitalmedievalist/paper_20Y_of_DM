you raise an interesting issue here (using description elements in 
transcription; BTW what would be the problem with using them "to both 
describe and transcribe a text in the same document"???).As for reviving discussion on ms transcription, however, I doubt a 
DM-supported initiative would be feasible: if you think about it, the 
SIGs are a way to have non-TEI people work on TEI-related issues, so 
it's already "not from within the TEI". The problem lies in the fact 
that the "manuscript transcription community", and that includes me of 
course, didn't manage to keep the SIG alive during the last year. Simply 
renaming a working group from TEI SIG to DM Manuscript Transcription 
Initiative wouldn't help much IMHO: it's the same people after all.What should we do then? My 0.02â‚¬:* the last SIG meeting (Baltimore, 23 October 2004) hinted at work to be 
done on time based encoding and Chapter 18 (Transcription of Primary 
Sources) revision: if something has been done by anyone, please put it 
on the wiki and let's start discussion on the SIG mailing list;
* apart from time based computing, many specific problems, even basic 
ones (graphical words vs semantical words, marginalia, etc.) should be 
discussed to arrive to a proposal before P5 is finalized: a good start, 
as I wrote in a previous message, would be looking at what solutions 
people adopted for their own projects (again on the SIG ml + wiki);
* this very discussion should be moved to the SIG ml :)Ciao--
