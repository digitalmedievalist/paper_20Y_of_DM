al classical sculpturesDigital Classicist London & Institute of Classical Studies seminar 2015

Room G21A, Senate House, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HU
http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2015-03ep.htmlHistorical casts of original classical sculptures can now function as importa=
nt archaeological records: we know that they may contain valuable archaeologi=
cal information subsequently lost from original sculptures. However, it was n=
ot unknown for the 19th century plaster craftsmen (formatori) to doctor the c=
asts, crafting their moulds such that when cast, a damaged sculpture would ap=
pear more complete. In this sense, plaster casts may be considered artefacts =
in their own right-rather than straightforward copies-representing 19th centu=
ry craft techniques and approaches to classical reception.In order to investigate these potential historical and archaeological signifi=
cances, 3D scans are being produced of both casts and original objects for co=
mparison. Scanning of casts is taking place at the British Museum, which hous=
es an early collection of casts of classical sculptures. Case studies have be=
en selected by identifying those sculptures for which there are early casts o=
f originals that remained in an outdoor context for many years after they wer=
e moulded; these casts are most likely to contain small surface details lost/=
changed from the originals by processes such as weathering. Sections of casts=
 of the Parthenon sculptures are to be scanned at the British Museum, and the=
 corresponding sections of the originals at the Acropolis Museum, Athens.The 3D images will record fine topographical details to facilitate study of t=
he current surface appearance and condition of the casts and originals. The t=
wo sets of images will then be visually compared and mapped onto each other t=
o indicate any differences. The comparative 3D scans will be used to facilita=
te interpretation of the complex nature of the plaster surfaces by attempting=
 to distinguish between differences caused by reductive processes on the orig=
inals (such as weathering) and additive processes on the casts (made up by th=
e formatori). Results are to be analysed in conjunction with detailed digital=
 photographs and/or reflectance transformation imaging (RTI), together with c=
onsideration of the historical context of both casts and originals, craft tec=
hniques used to produce the casts, and limitations of the scanning process wh=
en dealing with objects of two different materials (marble and plaster). The =
results should enhance our understanding both of the original sculptures and =
of the significances of the casts.ALL WELCOME
The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.--
