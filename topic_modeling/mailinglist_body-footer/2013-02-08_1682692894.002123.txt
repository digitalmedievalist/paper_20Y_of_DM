We invite applications for a 4-day training workshop on digitaltext-markup for epigraphic and papyrological editing, to be held in theInstitute for Classical Studies, London. The workshop will be taught byGabriel Bodard (KCL), James Cowey (Heidelberg), Simona Stoyanova (KCL)and Charlotte Tupman (KCL). There will be no charge for the teaching,but participants will have to arrange their own travel andaccommodation.
EpiDoc (epidoc.sf.net) is a set of guidelines for using TEI XML(tei-c.org) for the encoding of inscriptions, papyri and other ancientdocumentary texts. It has been used to publish digital projectsincluding the Inscriptions of Aphrodisias and Tripolitania, the USEpigraphy Project, Vindolanda Tablets Online and Curse Tablets fromRoman Britain, Pandektis (inscriptions of Macedonia and Thrace), and theDuke Databank of Documentary Papyri. The workshop will introduceparticipants to the basics of XML and markup and give hands-onexperience of tagging textual features and object description in EpiDocas well as use of the tags-free Papyrological Editor (papyri.info/editor).
No technical skills are required to apply, but a working knowledge ofGreek or Latin, epigraphy or papyrology and the Leiden Conventions willbe assumed. The workshop is open to participants of all levels, fromgraduate students to professors or professionals.
To apply for a place on this workshop please emailgabriel.bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk with a brief description of your reason forinterest and summarising your relevant skills and background, by FridayMarch 1st, 2013.
