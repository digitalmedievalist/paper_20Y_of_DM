constant growth of our little community during the past years. Having
been in the board right from the start, I feel it's only fair to let
somebody else take active part in DM activities, and help with running
the Journal, the list, etc.Keep up the good work!Ciao	Roberto-- Roberto Rosselli Del Turco      roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
