and more librarians on digital projects for exactly this reason, I
think.I will confess my thoughts were prompted by paging through some of the
more rare items in my collection and some work a colleague of mine is
doing on interfaces: many things done on personal computers from the
early 1990s onwards might still be recoverable and storable and of
interest to members of this community if there were collected on a
server somewhere. I was thinking how need it might be if we had a
library of some of the older, out-of-print disks and floppies available
to members of DM. Obviously copyright issues would need to be dealt
with, but it seems to me an author deposit system might work well, and
to the extent that presses are involved at all, they could probably be
convinced to give permission, since the technology in many cases would
be obsolete by now.Really just a synapse firing. The U of L is suddenly awash in surplus
servers (all quite low end) and I was wondering what I could do with one
or two.>
