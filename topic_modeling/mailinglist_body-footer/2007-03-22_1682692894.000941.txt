TEI Members Meeting, 1-3 November, 2007, University of Maryland.
http://www.lib.umd.edu/dcr/events/teiconference/index.htmlThis session will look at digital markup from the point of view of its
underlying theoretical assumptions and implications. Some questions we
are interested in considering:1) What are the theoretical implications of digital markup for editors,
paleographers, book historians, literary critics, linguists, etc. Are
they different from, similar to, or of a completely different order from
previous print practice?2) Are markup schemas theories of the structure of a text in the way
that linguistic theories are theories of language or literary theories
are theories about literature? Do they/should they have theoretical
lives of their own?3) Does electronic markup change the way we look at text?We are open to other understandings of the topic and papers do
not need to concentrate specifically, exclusively, or at all on the TEI.
They can be broad ranging or concentrate on specific smaller issues.Please email abstracts to daniel.odonnell(a)uleth.ca by March 30th.
