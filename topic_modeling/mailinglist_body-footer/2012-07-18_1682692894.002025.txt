 is a different operating system and different architecture. Depending on you=
r Mac (intel based plus enough memory) you may be able to install a version o=
f Windows on it. For more details refer to Apple's help notes on this at: htt=
p://support.apple.com/kb/HT3986Once you have a running version of Windows you will be able to install the MS=
I. The important thing to realise is that you will either be running MacOS OR=
 you will be running Windows.Hope this helps.RegardsTony Harris
