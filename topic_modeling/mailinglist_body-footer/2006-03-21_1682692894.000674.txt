identical to the way that Distributed Proofreaders[1] work for 
creating etexts for Project Gutenberg?  You see the scanned image and 
text of the OCR, and make corrections.What I've been dreaming of is sort-of something which does this for 
more than just the initial stages, but also successive layers of 
markup, transformation, etc.  What is increasingly becoming see as a 
virtual research environment.So not only the initial transcription, but also tools to add 
increasingly detailed layers of markup, image annotation, with 
revision/version control, xml validation, creation of supporting files 
(xsl, etc.), all through a single web interface.  The idea being that 
this would allow communal development of complex resources, as well as 
  some form of hosted preservation for them.  Sorta like a sourceforge 
for the communal development of electronic resources.  The major flaws 
with this is of course the solitaire nature of much humanities 
research, and the need for academic economics.-James
