Making the Old New Again: Digital Medievalism in an Ever-Changing WorldThe Oxford Text Archive, University of Oxford,  invites abstracts for
20 minute papers to be delivered in the above sponsored session at the
40th International Congress on Medieval Studies at Western Michigan
University (May 5-8, 2005).Session Abstract:
This session aims to bring together medievalists working with digital
projects to discuss their experiences with the every-changing and
evolving nature of these resources.  As increasingly more electronic
research tools are created and computing technology changes, making
the old resources accessible in new contexts is often extremely
challenging.  What do you do when your campus upgrades to a new
operating system and your 'Teach Yourself Old English' software no
longer functions?  How do you convert electronic manuscript editions
from a couple decades ago into a format so they will work with new
software?  Other related issues which could be included in the session
include: the re-purposing of older material to enable comparability in
new resources, the transformation of legacy data into standards-compliant 
formats, the introduction of out-dated material into new online publishing 
frameworks, and the special challenges faced by medieval resource creation.  
It is hoped that this session will attract those with both negative and 
positive experience of data migration and resource creation, and allow them 
to share their experience to help medievalists work towards common goals of 
preservation of the digital medieval resources we already have and best 
practice in future resource creation.Please send abstracts (max. 500 words) for proposed papers with an even 
shorter summary c.v.  to: James.Cummings(a)oucs.ox.ac.uk before 
1 September 2004.  Make sure to include complete contact information 
and AV requirements, and note that accepted participants must commit 
themselves to attend.For more information concerning this conference please see:
