ask when I have trouble with my Win98 machine is have you run the 
anti-virus program, and have you run the anti-spyware programs? I also 
wonder if you've installed any system software or performed any system 
updates lately, or installed or updated any software that might have 
updated system files. Is it just files written by Java, or other files 
that are causing problems (and have you updated your Java lately)? Are 
there any symptoms beyond the one obvious one--the use of URL-encoded 
names rather than names with spaces?PeterDaniel O'Donnell wrote:> The Digital Medievalist List (see end of message for contact
