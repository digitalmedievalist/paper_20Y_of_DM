London, WC1E 7HUDominic Oldman & Barry Norton (British Museum)
A new approach to Digital Editions of Ancient Manuscripts using 
CIDOC-CRM, FRBRoo and RDFaThe British Museum are producing a digital edition of Malcolm Mosher's 
work on the Book of the Dead, within which spells are presented in 
aggregated translations according to a number of traditions, presented 
alongside representative original vignettes. Papyri and linens that 
carry the spells and vignettes are distributed between different 
international institutions, but are associated with a much wider body of 
material culture that help to provide context for the spells. In our 
work the FRBRoo ontology is used to formalise the relationship between 
different works and manifestations, and interlinked with object 
descriptions in the CIDOC-CRM ontology.ALL WELCOMEThe seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information see the seminar website at
