t-funded project to fully catalogue its Islamic Manuscripts Collection. Suppo=
rted by a =E2=80=9CCataloging Hidden Special Collections and Archives=E2=80=
=9D grant administered by the Council on Library and Information Resources wi=
th generous funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the project, =E2=80=
=9CCollaboration in Cataloging: Islamic Manuscripts at Michigan=E2=80=9D has =
sought to engage established and emerging scholars by involving them in the c=
ataloguing process =E2=80=93 examination, description and generation of searc=
hable metadata =E2=80=93 for the collection of roughly 1,100 manuscripts in A=
rabic, Persian, and Turkish dating from the 8th to the 20th century CE.The manuscripts are being digitized and made freely accessible through the Ha=
thiTrust Digital Library in order to facilitate the cataloguing work, which l=
everages a web-based =E2=80=9Ccrowdsourcing=E2=80=9D approach to generate ric=
h and detailed descriptions addressing both material and textual characterist=
ics. The efforts of project staff at the University of Michigan, led by proje=
ct cataloguer Evyn Kropf, are thus supplemented by contributions from the wid=
er scholarly community as colleagues interact with brief inventory descriptio=
ns and the digitized manuscripts via the project website  ( http://www.lib.um=
ich.edu/islamic )As of now, 686 of the roughly 870 previously uncatalogued manuscripts have be=
en fully or near fully catalogued. 134 of these are manuscripts for which dig=
itization is not possible at this time.We greatly appreciate your support for the project thus far, and would be esp=
ecially grateful for any further contributions you could make to the catalogu=
ing of the remaining manuscripts, including review of existing descriptive da=
ta where available.Of the manuscripts remaining to be fully catalogued, most are from the follow=
ing collectionsHeyworth-Dunne

tinued participation in the cataloguing endeavors.We look forward to seeing your comments posted to the project site and thank =
