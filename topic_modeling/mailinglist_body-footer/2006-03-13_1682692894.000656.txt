Electronic Boethius) I modified some of the manuscript description
elements for use in transcription (for example, marking rubrics in the
text using the <rubric> element). This obviously wouldn't work if one
wanted to both describe and transcribe a text in the same document (as
most probably would?) but for EBo I think it worked okay.I personally would like to see an effort to bring manuscript
description and transcription together more closely. I think that this
would be done best not from within the TEI (and I speak as a member on
the TEI council), because the interests of the TEI are quite general.
But if the DM were to support an effort - a "Manuscript Encoding
Initiative" - incorporating manuscript description and transcription
(including codicology)...DotOn 3/13/06, Roberto Rosselli Del Turco <rosselli(a)ling.unipi.it> wrote:
