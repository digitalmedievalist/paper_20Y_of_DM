started using it. I used Endnote briefly and this seems like a product with
similar features except that it runs entirely on line (as opposed to
installing software and maintaining data on a local drive).Refworks will allow you to import data from on-line library and database
searches or you can import from Endnote v. 8 or higher. You can also input
individual entries using a form which follows any number of different style
templates (including user-defined).Advanced search capabilities allow you to search through your bibliographies
(which can be organized in different folders). Refworks will also pull up
any exact duplicate records or "near matches" to help you clean out
redundancies.Bibliography output formats include Word for Windows 2000 or later, Word for
Mac 98 or later, HTML, Rich Text Format, and Text format. Bibliographies can
be exported in any number of pre-programmed styles (Chicago, MLA, Turabian,
etc.). It looks like there are well over 100 different styles, but you can
also create your own (or modify existing styles). It didn't take me long to
create my own export style, and I'd think that most people on this list
wouldn't struggle much figuring it out. The process will intimidate many
into using one of the presets. There is a downloadable plug-in called
Write-n-Cite that allows you to run an abbreviated version of RefWorks
inside Microsoft Word. I haven't tried it.Data (or portions thereof) can be exported into XML, tab delimited,
"RefWorks Tagged Format" (for sharing with other RefWorks users), a citation
list, BibTex, or directly into EndNote, Reference Manager, or ProCite).There are a handful of start-up options and preferences (which folder to
start with, how many reference to display on a  screenpage, etc.). The site
can run in English, French, Spanish, or in one of four other oriental
languages. The interface is satisfactory and basically intuitive (by which,
I mean that I can leave it alone for several months and still find my way
around when I come back to it). There is good documentation via on-line
tutorials and helpfiles.I'm not associated with RefWorks in any way. The program seems to do all the
basic things I need to do, so, I'll probably continue to use it for my
relatively simple needs. If my institution let its subscription lapse, I
probably would not spend the money for an individual subscription. But I
don't rely that heavily on a bibliography manager at this point.Jesse
