something very much like XML/TEI for creating a true digital edition. A 
facsimile is nice to have, but no substitute for a true edition. What 
you lose is: ease of reading for all but specialists, searching, text 
manipulation, selection based on specialised tags for transcription 
data, etc. (But this goes without saying, surely?)I'm not a 'low tech' person myself, but I'd suggest you need to 
distinguish between different desired levels of competence. For someone 
without a technical background to learn a markup language like XML/TEI 
sufficiently well to be independent of technical support seems quite 
hard, among other things because in terms of infrastructure one needs so 
much much more than just the language (as Peter Robinson notes in his 
article).
On the other hand, it is not that complicated to learn to enter text in 
an XML editor, and to get to the stage where you can sensibly discuss 
design decisions with an XML expert.I also believe that looking at your texts from a markup perspective 
requires attention to both structure and to detail, which makes it a 
very instructive activity.PeterDaniel Paul O'Donnell wrote:> Hi all,
