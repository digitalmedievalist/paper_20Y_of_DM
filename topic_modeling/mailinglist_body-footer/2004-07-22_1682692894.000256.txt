Sorry about the three messages with attachments (please don't open them).
I've now set the controls of the list so that no attachments will be
distributed. This should stop the danger of viruses being passed around.I am not in Lethbridge and so can't double check, but I believe we may
still get virus messages passed on if the body of the e-mail contains
plain text; but they will be send without the offending attachment.If for some reason you need to post an example or would like to send an
attachment, the correct etiquette is to put it on a web page somewhere and
send a link. But everybody sending legitimate information thus far has
done that.Once again, sorry for not anticipating the problem.
