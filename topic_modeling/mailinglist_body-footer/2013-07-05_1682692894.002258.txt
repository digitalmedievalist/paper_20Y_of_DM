PHILIP SHAWI am a medievalist with around ten years' experience in digital humanities. M=
y first academic post was on the Partonopeus de Blois Electronic Edition Proj=
ect (<http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/partonopeus/>), where I worried about the te=
xtual difficulties of an Old French romance alongside straightening out the p=
roject's automated text processing needs. Since then I've developed a tool fo=
r gathering linguistic data from Twitter, used by Ruth Page in her _Stories a=
nd Social Media: Identities and Interaction_ (Routledge, 2012), have created =
tools for generating the indices of the Production and Use of English Manuscr=
ipts 1060-1220 project (<http://www.le.ac.uk/ee/em1060to1220/>), and was part=
 of the team responsible for HALOGEN (<http://halogen.le.ac.uk>). I am curren=
tly working on software tools for comparison across Middle English texts with=
 divergent orthographic forms and on the application of cluster analysis to h=
istorical onomastic data. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to th=
e running of Digital Medievalist as an Executive Board member.*****************************
PETER STOKESI am currently Senior Lecturer in the Department of Digital Humanities at Kin=
g's College London. I have a degree in Classics and English Literature and an=
other in Computer Engineering, as well as a PhD in Anglo-Saxon palaeography. =
I have worked as Research Associate, Analyst and/or Developer on the LangScap=
e (<http://langscape.org.uk/>), Anglo-Saxon Cluster (<http://ascluster.org/>)=
, and Electronic Sawyer (<http://esawyer.org.uk/>) projects at King's. I have=
 also held a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship on computer-based methods in =
palaeography, and was awarded a major research grant for DigiPal (<http://dig=
ipal.eu/>), which I lead as Principal Investigator. I lecture in Digital Huma=
nities and in palaeography, I advise on external digital projects, and I am P=
rincipal Coordinator of Medieval Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age (MMSDA=
; <http://www.ies.sas.ac.uk/study-training/research-training-courses/medieval=
-manuscripts-digital-age>), a five-day training programme for PhD students.A full CV is available at <http://peterstokes.org/cv/>.I have served on the Executive Board of Digital Medievalist and been Associat=
e Editor of the Journal since 2009, and I have been Director of DM since 2012=
. In addition to these roles I have contributed to DM in many other ways, inc=
luding updates, improvements and emergency fixes to the website; running conf=
erence sessions; helping introduce term limits for the Board; and co-acting a=
s Returning Officer for the 2010 elections. DM's membership has grown signifi=
cantly during this time, increasing by more than 15% in the last year, so if =
re-elected my key goal will be to establish the expertise and infrastructural=
 stability necessary to allow this growth to continue in the longer term.
