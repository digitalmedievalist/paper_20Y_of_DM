guidelines--or document modelling more generally. The range runs from=20
highly technical to quite theoretical, so there should be scope for most=20
active Digital Humanists.So like many academic conferences, there is no need to be a member in=20
order to participate. Of course you will have a chance to join the TEI=20
at the conference if you wish! We might even let you drink the Koolaid ;)-dan--=20
