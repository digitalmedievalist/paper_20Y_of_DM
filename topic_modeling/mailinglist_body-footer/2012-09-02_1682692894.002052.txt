 in College Station (Texas) has reserved some limited slots on the program fo=
r late breaking submissions.=20
Please notice that these submissions, although evaluated by the programme com=
mittee, do not undergo the normal peer review process and therefore will only=
 be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings after further peer=
 review. Otherwise the requirements and proposal formats are very similar; de=
tails of the call for paper  can be found at the conference web pagehttp://idhmc.tamu.edu/teiconference/=20We hope that the announcement of this possibility will come as a relief to th=
ose who missed the
deadline of the first round of submissions, but still would like to have a
chance to contribute to the program of the meeting.The deadline for late breaking submissions is the 1st of October 2012. You ca=
n submit your proposal via conftool:http://www.tei-c.org/conftool/There will also be an exciting slate of pre-conference workshops to be announ=
ced really soon now, so please watch this space, or the conference website fo=
r further information.For the programme committee,Elena Pierazzo
