Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Marjorie,I fully recognise the problem but unless you want do the typesetting yourself=
, then there is no real need to use any of these packages. My personal experi=
ence teaches me that professional typesetters can perfectly set as many layer=
s of footnotes as you need and many of them will take XML or SGML files as in=
put.Godfried-----Original Message-----

Subject: [dm-l] Multiple streams / stages of footnotes: what solutions?Dear list,
As those of you who have had the pleasure to tackle critical editions in=20
printed form, the traditional
mutiple streams or "stages" of footnotes (variants + biblical references=20
+ sources, for instance) are a real pain, and very few solutions are=20
offered.I knew of two, mainly (leaving aside InDesign and the like): LaTex (for=20
the bold and slightly geeky critical editor with time on his hands), and=20
the Classical Text Editor, an apparently quite interesting text editor=20
dedicated to critical editions (unfortunately rather expensive).I have just discovered that, apparently, a word processor for MacOSX is=20
capable of handling those multiple layers:

See also for a more detailed explanation of the footnotes features p.=20
111- 124 in the PDF manual:
http://www.connectnw.com/redlers/MellelGuide.pdf
Unfortunately, I have no MacOsX at hand for the moment, and haven't been=20
able to give this word processor a test yet. But I would be very=20
interested to hear from the DM-L list members, if ever some of you had=20
tried this Mellel software.More generally, do some of you use other solutions to handle multiple=20
streams of footnotes in their *printed* editions, and what is your=20
assesment of the various solutions?Best, Marjorie--=20
