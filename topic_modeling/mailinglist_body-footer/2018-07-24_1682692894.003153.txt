this fall, similar to those that universities often run for their
communities of lifelong learners. Participants in this October 23-28
trip will join me in England to visit two once-in-a-lifetime
exhibitions: "Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms" at the British Library and "Tolkien:
Maker of Middle Earth" at Oxford's Bodleian Library, with curatorial
introductions and expert guides. *These exhibitions overlap for only one
week, making this trip a unique opportunity for visitors to see them
together.*
For more information, please see the brochure here:https://www.medievalacademy.org/resource/resmgr/pdfs/MAA_Trip_to_England.pdf
Proceeds benefit Medieval Academy of America programs in support of
student, adjunct, unaffiliated, and junior scholars.
Please feel free to forward this link to anyone you know who might be
interested, whether or not they are academics. Travelers do not need to
be Medieval Academy members to participate. *The trip is limited to
twenty travelers, so interested participants should register as soon as
possible and no later than August 23!*
