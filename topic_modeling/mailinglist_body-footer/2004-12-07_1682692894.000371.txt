to make ig generally available? And will it deal
with other than standard english letters (=C3=A6, =C3=BE, =C3=B0)?
       By the way, I=C2=B4m new to the list. My own electronic
project is a data base to analyze the distribution
of saints' cults in iceland (and, hopefully, elswhere.)
Comments are welcome on the site www.tasc.mpg.de/iceland

Subject: [dm-l] Bandwidth?The Digital Medievalist List (see end of message for contact information and =

Hello all,
        I am posting this query on behalf of a colleague who has built a neat
little concordance maker: you drop text into it and almost immediately
you get a kwic (Key Word in Context) concordance back. It did Beowulf in
5 seconds.
        Is there anyway of determining bandwidth used by a program such as
this? He is worried about overusing his university's resources.
