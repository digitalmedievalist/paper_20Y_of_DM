screenshots and in my case, I've been using my citation manager also as
a circulation manager (it's a long story, but... I was getting tired of
swearing I wouldn't lend books, doing it anyway, and then losing them,
so I dicided instead to LoC them, but card pockets in the back and make
people "sign them out"--works like a charm).Do you know/does anybody here use this as a personal citation manager?-dOn Fri, 2006-24-02 at 11:22 -0700, Binkley, Peter wrote:
