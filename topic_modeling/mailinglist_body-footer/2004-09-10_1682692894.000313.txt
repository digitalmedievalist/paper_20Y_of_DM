Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableWow, I'd never thought of <lb> preceding a line (certianly not the first). I'=
ve always used them as following. Same is true for pb and cb, though I suppos=
e I'd put the following p. number on @n were I to number them.I wonder though if you should number a pb cb or lb, however. The tag doesn't =
really contain the page, or whatever, after all. It is a point *between* page=
s, lines, columns, etc. (think about lb and l. <l> naturally has a line numbe=
r because it contains a line. <lb> on the other hand marks a point and so ssh=
ouldn't have @n.What we really need is a <pb/> : <pg></pg> pairing though that can rapidly ca=
use hierarchy problems.One solution might be this:text <pb> <milestone type=3Dpagenumber n=3D2> more text...The only reason for offerng this is a) the pb describes a point (correctly IM=
O) and the milestone is not incorrect in reporting that it is on p. 2.This is a good topic for a firt entry in a best practice for medievalists gui=

I'm sorry, but this is a bit of a technical question. Please delete if=20
you hate those.I wonder if anyone who has worked with using TEI P3-4 to encode=20
manuscript or printed book transcriptions or editions could tell me if a=20
local standard among medievalists is developing for the use of=20
"milestone" elements that have to do with the arrangement of the=20
physical object, such as line break, column break and page break tags.Specifically, I'm wondering if the attributes given to these tags (such=20
as 'n') usually refer to the page (line, etc.) following or the page=20
(line, etc.) preceding the milestone element. My *guess* is that these=20
breaks are usually connected to the text following, but I don't see a=20
logic in the tags themselves that would require that and my experience=20
of what people do is pretty limited to my own narrow part of the field.I should comment that part of my doubt stems from the way pb, lb, and cb=20
are described in the Guidelines. Both pb and cb say "marks the boundary=20
between one . . . [X] and the next in a standard reference system,"=20
apparently indicating that there should be an X already there before the=20
first of these tags is used in a file; whereas lb  "marks the start of a=20
new (typographic) line in some edition or version of a text," indicating=20
that it should be used before the first (typographic) line.  I do not=20
believe that either the implied variation in application (to a "standard=20
reference system" on the one hand and "some edition or version" on the=20
other) or the stated variation in placement (before or between bits of=20
text) is intended in any strong sense--probably at all--by the editors,=20
by the way. Several milestone elements (milestone itself, handshift,=20
etc.) do make reasonably clear, either in their Guidelines description=20
or in the examples given, that they are meant to be used at the=20
beginning of a section of text to which they refer .Murray McGillivray_______________________________________________
