grams (DBBE, hosted at Ghent University), freely accessible at https://www.db=
be.ugent.be.Thanks to the generous support of the Special Research Fund of Ghent Universi=
ty, DBBE has been completely redesigned over the past two years, in close col=
laboration with the Database, Document and Content Management<https://ddcm.ug=
ent.be/> research group of the Faculty of Engineering of Ghent University and=
 with the Ghent Centre for Digital Humanities<https://www.ghentcdh.ugent.be/>.The corpus of Byzantine metrical paratexts collected in our Database has been=
 consistently enlarged, through the systematic consultation of manuscripts an=
d relevant secondary literature, and it now counts some 10700 single epigrams=
, over 7000 of which are the result of first-hand inspection of (reproduction=
s of) manuscripts. In comparison with the previous version of DBBE, our users=
 are offered the possibility to navigate more easily through the different re=
cords, which are much better linked to each other. The search function of Gre=
ek text has been refined and provides users with more accurate results.While the distinction between Occurrences<https://www.dbbe.ugent.be/occurrenc=
es/search> (unique epigrams as to be found in manuscripts) and Types<https://=
www.dbbe.ugent.be/types/search> (normalised texts of similar occurrences) has=
 been retained, a new way to group epigrams has been introduced: the Verse Va=
riants records. These pages display a clear overview of the parallels and dev=
iations of single verse lines. The Verse Variants are accessible by clicking =
on single epigram verse lines.The main scope of DBBE is collecting Byzantine book epigrams and offering the=
ir texts to the scholarly community. However, we are aiming to make available=
 contextual data as well, and have paid major attention to the improvement of=
 information on Manuscript<https://www.dbbe.ugent.be/manuscripts/search> and =
Persons<https://www.dbbe.ugent.be/persons/search>. The Bibliography section h=
as been adjusted and it now includes a search path.We gladly refer to our Help page<https://www.dbbe.ugent.be/pages/help> and Se=
arch Tricks and Tips<https://www.dbbe.ugent.be/pages/search-tips-tricks> page=
 for more information.We encourage users to explore the new features of DBBE and are eager to welco=
me their comments and feedback at dbbe(a)ugent.be<mailto:dbbe(a)ugent.be>.For the whole DBBE team<https://www.dbbe.ugent.be/pages/team>,Floris Bernard
