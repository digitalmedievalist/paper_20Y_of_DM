(http://www.hamrick.com). I have been using it for years, and it has 
never disappointed me; it is better than any other scanning interface I 
have tried. Photoshop is the tool of choice for image editing, but 
VueScan is much better for scanning. You can download a free trial to 
see if you agree.DavidAbdullah Alger wrote:> For texts (books) then I would say use a scanner.  I know someone who did
