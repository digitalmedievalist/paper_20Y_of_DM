education?  These tasks are basic computer literacy which has little=20
to do with 'Humanities Computing' per se.  Almost every university in=20
the UK has some provision for IT training should students require it.=20
  Even at the University of Manchester where you are students can take=20
courses via the IT Services:
http://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/trainingcourses/Surely what you should be doing on any course which requires basic IT=20
skills (or heaven forfend more advanced skills!) is stating this as a=20
prerequisite and directing students to the IT Services to receive=20
training in these skills.If teaching a course (say on use of XML for producing critical=20
editions or general text encoding) I don't think that we should feel=20
any compunction in listing basic familiarity with HTML as a=20
prerequisite, as long as students have access to training in that=20
area.  (I'm not suggesting you say they must have taken specific=20
course X, simply that they are aware that it is a prerequisite and so=20
they should have learnt it somewhere.)It just seems to be an inefficient waste of resources for us to=20
duplicate training that is already available to most students.  Great,=20
offer topics which use a higher level of technology to drive the=20
learning process, but where it isn't the end in itself (teaching=20
palaeography on computer is a good example of this).  If increasingly=20
all the interesting courses list 'At least basic computer literacy' as=20

skills.But of course, I was using mainframes at the age of 8, so my=20
perspective may vary from yours. ;-)-James_______________________________________________
