reference), on the "general bugs" page, I find:"- IE 3.0: It does not appear to cascade styles correctly."Obviously, this part hasn't been updated in a while; but perhaps
rendering nested styles correctly (which is what I'm assuming the
above means) remains an IE problem?Honestly, beyond a certain point, I've stopped trying to make things
work with IE.  But that may be eminently unhelpful to you.  :)-Vika--
