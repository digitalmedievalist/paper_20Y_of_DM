roundtable session at the International Congress on Medieval Studies at 10
AM on Friday, May 11. We'll be in Fetzer 2040.*What is MESA?*
MESA is a federation of electronic medieval studies projects that provides
a portal allowing the simultaneous searching of all member projects and
provides peer review of electronic scholarship in the field of medieval
studies. It is a sister federation of the Networked Infrastructure for
Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship (NINES) <http://www.nines.org/>and
18thConnect <http://www.18thconnect.org/>, and will be linked to both of
these federations, allowing users to search any of the federations
separately or in any combination.*How does MESA work?*
MESA runs on Collex, an open-source collections- and exhibits-builder that
is also the basis of NINES and 18thConnect. It uses Resource Description
Framework (RDF) files that make data from member sites discoverable and
cross-searchable. A good overview of how Collex works can be found on the
NINES site at http://www.nines.org/about/software/collex/MESA will be launching later this year and is partnering with NINES and
18thConnect to build a larger meta-federation called ARC. Representatives
from MESA, NINES, and ARC will be on the panel, and we are hoping to get
feedback from the community as we plan our launch. Hope to see you there!Tim Stinson & Dot Porter--
