Science students have just reconstructed part of Otto Ege's "Fifty
Original Leaves" portfolio, leaf no. 30 by uploading, cataloguing, and
sequencing 27 leaves from 27 collections in the Fragmentarium interface.
Here's the direct link to the reconstruction:
http://www.fragmentarium.unifr.ch/view/page/F-djs6Fragmentarium is a new interface that allows for cataloguing of
individual leaves (for example,
http://www.fragmentarium.unifr.ch/overview/F-qux7) and creating an
online reconstruction. In particular, it allows users to create flexible
and editable IIIF-compliant reconstructions in a shared-canvas viewer.
It is truly extraordinary, and the possibilities are endless. The data
for each leaf and for the reconstructed object can (and will) be updated
and refined at any time, and additional leaves can be easily added. The
records for individual leaves, can be found by searching from the
Fragmentarium homepage, http://www.fragmentarium.unifr.ch/
As their final assignment, I assigned each student one example of "Fifty
Original Leaves" no. 30 (a lovely early fifteenth-century Book of Hours)
to catalogue in Fragmentarium. In addition to identifying the text on
each leaf, part of the cataloguing process includes creating a shared-
canvas sequence in which the two images are presented in the correct
order. Then we worked together to establish the original sequence of
leaves, assembling the individual canvases in Fragmentarium to create
the reconstruction, which has its own record. Once we had built the
reconstruction, one group of students looked at the totality of the
preserved liturgy to investigate Use (it's Paris). A different group of
students scoured the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts and discovered
that this manuscript was likely C. L. Ricketts, Census no. 116. That
entry led us to two Quaritch catalogues (1905 and 1910), and the
Conway/Davis Directory pointed us to a 1939 Parke-Bernet sale. Once we
found the Quaritch and PB catalogues, the identification was confirmed.
The Quaritch, Ricketts, and PB descriptions can be clearly identified
with the reconstructed manuscript, not only by codicological features
but by the contents, which include enough unusual features to make the
identification certain. This identification would not be possible based
on the data provided by a single leaf. Only by reassembling the extant
leaves can we conduct research on the liturgy and provenance of the
original codex.
I'll be giving a paper on the project at the International Congress on
Medieval Studies at Western Michigan University next May. The whole
process was a very effective pedagogical tool with real results, and I
look forward to putting my class to work on a different reconstruction
every year. I am so grateful to Fragmentarium directors William Duba and
Christoph Flüeler for facilitating the project, and to the holding
institutions for making their images available.
