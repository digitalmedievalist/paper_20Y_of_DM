Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitI have been involved in a planning committee to prepare suggestions for the 
technology to be used for creating digital facsimiles of the unpublished 
manuscripts and typescripts of a scholar (although not medieval, but from 
the 20th century). After reading some articles and searching the Web for 
the technical descriptions of similar projects I still have some questions, 
and I wonder whether someone on this list might be able to give me advice 
on the following issues:Which equipment would you recommend for creating 600 dpi color images 
(TIFF)?  Is it better to use a scanner or a digital photo camera for such a 
project?  The great majority of the pages are on standard type paper (DIN 
A4 and DIN A5) and do not need special care when handling them.Using the method you recommended, approx. how many pages can be digitized 
in one hour?I appreciate your thoughts.Dieter KÃ¶hler--===============5922780995336025075==--
