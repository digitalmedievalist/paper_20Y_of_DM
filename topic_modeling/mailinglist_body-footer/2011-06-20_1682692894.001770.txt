(Feel free to forward elsewhere)Digital Medievalist will be holding elections in early July for four
positions to its Executive Board. Board positions are for two year
terms and incumbents may be re-elected. Members of the Board are
responsible for the overall direction of the organisation and leading
the Digital Medievalist’s many projects and programmes. This is a
working board, and so if you are willing and able to volunteer time to
helping Digital Medievalist undertake some of its activities (such as
hands on copy-editing of its journal) then please take this into
consideration when nominating yourself or accepting a nomination.For further information about the Executive and Digital Medievalist
more generally please see the DM website, particularly:- http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/about.html
- http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.htmlWe are now seeking nominations (including self-nominations) for the
annual elections. In order to be eligible for election, candidates

have made some demonstrable contribution to the DM project (e.g. to
the mailing list, journal, conference sessions, or the wiki, etc.), or
more generally to the field of digital medieval studies in some
demonstrable manner.If you are interested in running for these positions or are able to
recommend a suitable candidate, please contact the returning officers,
James Cummings and Marjorie Burghart at:   election at digitalmedievalist.orgwho will treat your nomination in confidence. Candidates will need to
provide a short biographical statement of not more than 150 words.The nomination period will close at 00:00 UTC (midnight) on Monday 27
