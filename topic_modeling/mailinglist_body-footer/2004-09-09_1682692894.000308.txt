Medievalist Project poster was awarded a third place 
in the recent poster competition for the Digital 
Resources in the Humanities conference which took 
place 5-8 September 2004.  This placing may have been 
affected by my extremely active lobbying when I 
discovered the prize for winning the competition was 
a digital camera. 
(Third place only gets honorable mention *drat*) :-)There were approximately 22 entrants in the competition 
and the winner was the "Cistercians in Yorkshire" project[1] 
which had some very sexy virtual reality recreations of 
monastic buildings from Yorkshire.  I am happy another 
medieval entry won, and I think we can be comforted by the 
obvious need for the Digital Medievalist Project given the 
number of medieval related entries.  Out of the 22 entrants 
listed in the booklet of poster abstracts, at least 7 of them 
are related to the Middle Ages.One of the plenary speakers at the conference was 
Chris Patten[2] who made a breezingly polite tour of 
the posters and exhibitions.  As he paused at our poster 
(maybe the bright background was a good idea...), I 
proceeded to explain the project to him.  And as politicians 
do, he made himself appear very interested before quickly 
walking around the rest of them and departing.I was pleased to find that a number of the other medieval 
poster entrants and speakers were already members of this 
list.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a number of others 
who I know have only passing interest in the Middle Ages, 
but are interested in such aspects as text encoding also 
were lurking on the list.-James[1]http://cistercians.shef.ac.uk/
