second summer school, to be held 20-24 July in Prague, Czech Republic, on
the theme “Researching Medieval Culture in a Digital Environment.” The
interdisciplinary five-day program is geared especially toward early-career
historians and other scholars (doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows)
in Medieval Studies as well as toward archivists, librarians, and
e-scientists that engage with or specialise in this time period. No prior
experience with digital research methods is required.  Participants will
need their own laptops. Through a number of hands-on sessions, participants
will learn how to enhance their research with tools such as Abbreviationes,
Classical Text Editor, and Manuscriptorium. They will also have the
opportunity to experiment with the integrative CENDARI Virtual Research
Environment. Lectures on the fundamentals of Digital Humanities and its
prospects for Medieval Studies as well as field trips to cultural heritage
sites in Prague will complete the program. The school will be held at the
attractive Old Town venue of the Institute of Philosophy of the Czech
Academy of Sciences.
The closing date for applications is 15 April 2015 and a number of travel
bursaries are available.
