y original message.  On a positive note I would like to enumerate a number of=
 ways in which I have found computers to be helpful.  In the majority of case=
s, however, it has been me as an individual using technology (mostly quite cr=
ude, MS office style technology) to do things. I.e. a domain expert who also =
uses IT as best I can.  The idea of non-domain specialists who are proficient=
 in IT of itself is in my view an 'old world' view of technology that takes u=
s back to mainframes and specialist programmers building big systems and data=
bases. But the world we live in, since the PC arrived in the 1980s, is increa=
singly end-user computing.1.  Spell checking. I have written one program to do this, which involves com=
puting all possible Latin inflections in one fell swoop.  The MS Word checker=
, as you probably know, does not understand inflection.  This does not matter=
 with English, which is comparatively uninflected.  The problem is that there=
 are a few million possible words required, which is simply too big for MS wo=
rd, which collapses.  The right way would be to construct a proper parser whi=
ch understood Latin grammar, but this is beyond my skill.  (Well, possibly no=
t, as my MSc was in natural language processing and machine translation, but =
my knowledge of that tells me the job would take more time and effort than I =
have).2.  More successful was a simple correction function using the VBA 'textrepla=
ce' function.  The reason I need this is to convert printed versions of Latin=
 text into digitised versions.  OCR is still pretty hopeless at character rec=
ognition, as we all know, so the corrector function looks for impossible lett=
er combinations.  For example, OCR generally confused 'e' and 'c', so renders=
 the Latin 'essent' as 'esscnt' or 'csscnt' or something like that.  So I sea=
rch and replace 'cnt' into 'ent', knowing that 'cnt' is not possible.  There =
are hundreds of other examples.  I also check for known mistakes on common wo=
rds, e.g. 'vcl' should be 'vcl' and stuff like that.=20There still remains the bulk of the work, which is formatting the material co=
rrectly.  OCR is not very good at understanding footnotes, Greek words, other=
 parts of the critical apparatus, and getting this right requires simple hard=
 work.  I have a little image of a medieval scribe on my screen, who was doin=
g exactly the same thing, really.=203.  I have a Latin site searcher on my website http://www.logicmuseum.com/lat=
insearcher.htm which uses the Google search engine to look for Latin expressi=
ons in a targeted way.  This means I can search for hundreds of examples in t=
he original Latin, in many cases matching the Latin to an English translation=
, e.g. like this http://www.google.com/search?hl=3Den&q=3D"quod%20quid%20est"=
+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.logicmuseum.com&meta=3D .  This is in principle no d=
ifferent to the way that a dictionary or wordbook gives you an example of how=
 a phrase is used by the classical authors. The difference is merely the scal=
e.  A dictionary will give you a handful of results, the search linked to abo=
ve gives you 53.  Again, this is not sophisticated technology - a few lines o=
f Java plus the already existing Google.4.  I have just implemented a wiki on the same site http://www.logicmuseum.co=
m/wiki/Main_Page .  This was fairly simple and used existing technology (Medi=
awiki and Semantic mediawiki).  The ambition is to provide access to all the =
key (Latin) texts of the medieval period - the principles are outlined here h=
ttp://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/The_Logic_Museum:What_is_the_Logic_Museum .  A=
gain, the main principles are no different to the old way of doing things. Fo=
r example, I used 'anchoring' to index Aristotelian texts to their 'Bekker nu=
mber' (a pre-computer way of locating any Aristotelian text by page, column a=
nd line number of the 19C Bekker edition).  =205.  I have used the (fairly basic) MediaWiki implementation of tables to make=
 parallel Latin English translations - thus fulfillling the ambition of bring=
ing these wonderful works to a wider audience. E.g. here http://www.logicmuse=
um.com/wiki/Authors/Ockham/Summa_Logicae/Book_I/Chapter_11 .  This is an area=
 where pure IT could actually help, as the Java based CKeditor is awful, full=
 of bugs and difficult to use.  But it is usable. Note the green tick marks o=
n the page which tell me that the page has been checked once (but not peer re=
viewed). This is the technology version of a system that translators have use=
d for centuries.=20On the general subject of bringing to a wider audience I was inspired some ye=
ars ago by the site of a critical edition in a specialist library.  It was fi=
fty years old, in tatters, with pages missing.  To locate these texts you had=
 to use a card index. When you took the book out, you had to fill a form in a=
nd place it on the shelf.  Then you would place the book on a trolley for it =
to be filed by some clerk.  The building itself dates from the 1930s and has =
not received a lick of paint since then.  There has to be a better way than t=
his. Add to that the fact that, even though I have the run of the finest Lond=
on libraries, there are many important texts that they do not have (e.g. the =
Alluntis edition of Scotus' Quodlibetal questions - not in any London library=
).  Why do people spend a lot of time and effort preparing these editions, to=
 have some press squirt ink onto paper, publish them at hugely inflated price=
s, even though the main work of doing them (preparation and peer review) was =
unpaid labour?  There has to be a better system - although the problem here i=
s economic, not IT related.6.  Which naturally brings me to wikis.  Daniel Paul O'Donnell ("Disciplinary=
 impact and technological obsolescence in digital medieval studies" online he=
re=20
http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Research/disciplinary-impact-and-tech=
nological-obsolescence-in-digital-medieval-studies) makes some very good poin=
ts on this.  The technology of wikis is proven, yet academic specialists do n=
ot use them.  He says (correctly) that this is an economic problem.  Wikis de=
pend on collaborative effort, where the contributions of the individual are s=
ubordinate to the interests of the group.  But "in my experience, most profes=
sional scholars initially are extremely impressed by the possibilities offere=
d by collaborative software like wikis and other forms of annotation engines=
=E2=80=94before almost immediately bumping up against the problems of prestig=
e and quality control that currently make them infeasible as channels of high=
 level scholarly communication ... Professional scholars traditionally achiev=
e success=E2=80=94both institutionally and in terms of reputation=E2=80=94by =
the quality and amount of their research publications. Community-based collab=
orative projects do not easily fit into this model. "
I believe these problems could be resolved by better use of categorisation an=
d markup (to address the quality control issue), and by allowing 'ownership' =
of designated pages on the wiki. There is absolutely no reason why a critical=
 edition, or a translation, could not be produced entirely online, by a colla=
borative effort of a small group, working in different parts of the world.  I=
 would welcome ideas on this, from anyone working on editions, or translation=
s.  There has to be a better way than would we have now, and perhaps this cou=
ld be achieved by appropriate use of technology.Edward
