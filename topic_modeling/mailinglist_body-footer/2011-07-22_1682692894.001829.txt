*Third call for papers – Extended deadline to August 1!**SDH 2011 Supporting Digital Humanities: Answering the unaskable*17-18 November, CopenhagenFollowing up on the success of the first SDH conference, held in Vienna 
in 2010, the CLARIN and DARIAH initiatives have decided to jointly 
organise the second SDH conference, to be held in November 2011 at the 
University of Copenhagen, Denmark, a participant in both CLARIN and DARIAH.Digital technologies have the potential to transform the types of 
research questions that we ask in the Humanities, allowing us both to 
address traditional questions in new and exciting ways but also to 
answer questions that we were not even aware we could ask – hence the 
title of this conference. How can digital humanities help us not just to 
find the answers to our research questions more quickly and more easily, 
but also to formulate research questions we would never have been able 
to ask without access to large quantities of digital data and 
sophisticated tools for their analysis? Supporting Digital Humanities 
will be a forum for the discussion of these innovations, and of the ways 
in which these new forms of research can be facilitated and supported.CLARIN and DARIAH are creating European research infrastructures for the 
humanities and related disciplines. SDH2011 aims to bring together 
infrastructure providers and users from the communities involved in 
these two infrastructure initiatives. The conference will consist of a 
number of topical sessions where providers and users will present and 
discuss results, obstacles and opportunities for digitally-supported 
humanities research. Participants are encouraged to engage with honest 
assessments of the intellectual problems and practical barriers in an 
open and constructive atmosphere.The first SDH conference in 2010 gave a broad and multi-facetted 
presentation of the domains of interest to CLARIN and DARIAH. This time 
we have chosen a somewhat more focussed approach, concentrating on two 
major themes, but not excluding other themes of interest for the 
humanities. The two themes are:•    Sound and movement – music, spoken word, dance and theatre
•    Texts and things – texts, and the relationship between texts and 
material artefacts, such as manuscripts, stone or other carriers of textsSubmissions are invited for individual papers and posters, as well as 
panels. Focus should be on tools and methods for the analysis of digital 
data rather than on digitisation processes themselves, both from the 
provider and from the user perspective. We want to pay special attention 
to inspiring showcases that demonstrate the innovative power of digital 
methods in the humanities.*Some important dates*
