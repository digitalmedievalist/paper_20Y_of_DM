available during the second week of august instead? I've done a doodle
poll of August 8 - 12th.http://doodle.com/tave7usmp4tbrt63The times are 4pm, 5pm, 6pm using London Time, however, If it can pick
up your timezone from your browser it should display them in your
local time. (Let me know if it works, or conversely, if it doesn't!)Expand all 5 days.-JamesOn Mon, Jul 18, 2011 at 16:02, Marjorie Burghart
