cells, then in another column you can automatically put 1, 2, 3, etc. down the
side by highlighting the first two or three and then by dragging the pointer
down to where the end of the text is.  You can also modify the numbers in a
different format, by selecting a custom format for the cells.  Below is a
sample of what I did.Abdullah Alger<L 1>	   cyninge

Quoting Murray McGillivray <mmcgilli(a)ucalgary.ca>:> Folks, I have a number of text files of poetry that I'd like to add 
> line numbers to for concordancing, starting the numbering at 1 and 
> continuing to the last text line, with the line numbers ending up as 
> part of the resulting text file, each number on the relevant line 
> before the text of that line of verse begins.

> I've done this before a few times a while ago, but danged if I can 
> remember what I used. I know I didn't write anything to do it, though 
> I assume it's pretty easy to do so.  I think it was in a text editor 
> or word processor, but looking at vi and emacs it looks like I can 
> only get the line numbers to display with the file, not to be added

> The UNIX/Linux "nl" utility does basically what I want (if I pipe the 
> output to a file, I get  my text file back but with a line number and 
> a tab added to the beginning of each line), and I can deal with the 
> output but I remember (possibly from one of those technicolor 
> dreams--you'll let me know!) a more interactive, less command-liney, 
> way of doing this that would make this stage easier.
