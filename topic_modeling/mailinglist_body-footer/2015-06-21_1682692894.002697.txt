collation workshop to be held on Monday, 29 June 2015 from 9:30 through
4:30 as part of the ADHO DH2015: Global Digital Humanities conference at
the University of Western Sydney. The workshop will teach participants how
to use the open-source CollateX collation tool to compare witnesses of a
text automatically, in a way that can be used to produce critical textual
editions and other types of comparative documents. Participants will learn
how to prepare source materials in any written script for collation, how
to perform automated collation using CollateX, and how to inspect and
modify the results. To register for the workshop please follow the link at
http://dh2015.org/workshops/. The workshop web site (still under
development) is accessible at http://collatex.obdurodon.org, and includes
instructions for downloading and installing CollateX prior to the
workshop. --===============6714542183110609775==--
