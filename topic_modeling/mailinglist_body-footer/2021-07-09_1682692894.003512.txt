=80=9Dmagaz=C3=A9n | International Journal for Digital and Public HumanitiesVenice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities (unive.it/vedph<http://unive.=
it/vedph>)Department of Humanities, Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy
magaz=C3=A9n | International Journal for Digital and Public Humanitiesmagaz=C3=A9n is the interdisciplinary journal of the Venice Centre for Digita=
l and Public Humanities (VeDPH) based at the Department of Humanities at Ca=
' Foscari University of Venice undergoing double blind peer review an=
d published twice per year in digital copy and html version in open access by=
 Edizioni Ca' Foscari<https://edizionicafoscari.unive.it/en/edizioni4=
/>. The VeDPH is founded upon an initiative of excellence that aims at stimul=
ating an interdisciplinary methodological discourse to serve as the basis for=
 the collaborative development of durable, reusable, shared resources for res=
earch and learning in the field of digital and public humanities. Its discipl=
inary domains include Digital Textual Scholarship, Digital and Public Art His=
tory, Digital and Public History, Digital Cultural Heritage and Digital and P=
ublic Archaeology.
Call for Papers | Volume 2022: [re]constructionsmagaz=C3=A9n is accepting proposals to its 2022 volume entitled =E2=80=9C[re]=
constructions=E2=80=9D, which shall devote two semestral issues of the journa=
l (June and December) to the theory and practice of [re]configuring lost real=
ities, [re]creating long gone dimensions, [re]building likely scenarios, [re]=
considering exhibition settings and [re]covering disappeared traces of histor=
ical and cultural value. Indeed, over the last decade the principle of [re]co=
nstruction by means of scholarly expertise set the pace of many recent resear=
ch projects in the prosperous field of digital and public humanities. Particu=
larly digital tools and interdisciplinary collaborations provided the opportu=
nity to [re]compose varied sources and [re]visualise research data, such as t=
o offer unprecedented insights in historical, societal, cultural, artistic, a=
rchaeological, and political events. Evolving research technologies and conso=
lidated methodological approaches in the digital and public humanities allowe=
d scholars to test their analytical abilities against a set of novel possibil=
ities to make their results public, immersive, and virtually appreciated. In =
this regard, digital and public humanities lay at the crossroads of the kind =
of speculation, intuition, and invention that comes with every act of scholar=
ly [re]construction, seen as a creative task steered by scientific rigour.
A true symbol of this attitude are the square brackets, which stand as a visu=
al sign and signifier of the =E2=80=9Cgap-filling=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cmeani=
ng-making=E2=80=9D tasks humanists always aim to accomplish in their research=
 work. In a sense, digital and public humanists have the privilege of [re]fra=
ming their disciplines in various ways, such as: filling the gap of missing t=
ext fragments and traditions, retracing the dynamics of historical processes =
and events, retrieving dispersed artworks and collections, reconstructing los=
t archaeological sites and artefacts. Eventually, magaz=C3=A9n's volu=
me 2022 will draw particular attention to the public aspects of such endeavou=
rs, given that successful [re]constructions hold firm to the principle of res=
earch dissemination and audience involvement from their very inception, rathe=
r than having public access just as a late side-effect of scholarly work.
Hence, for its 2022 volume magaz=C3=A9n is set to examine in two semestral is=
sues the concept of =E2=80=9C[re]constructions=E2=80=9D as a procedural and c=
onstitutional peculiarity of digital and public humanities. Scholars are part=
icularly invited to submit contributions that span from theoretical debates t=
o methodological reflections, also comprising the examination of particular c=
ase studies from the heterogeneous domains of Digital Textual Scholarship, Di=
gital and Public History, Digital and Public Archaeology, Digital and Public =
Art History, GLAM studies.
