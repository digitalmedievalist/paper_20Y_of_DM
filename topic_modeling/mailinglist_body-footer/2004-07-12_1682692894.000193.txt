Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI don't find the encoding declared in the HTML or in the response 
headers, so I think Firefox is guessing its default encoding. In fact 
the pages are ISO-8859-1.Speaking of Firefox and diagnosing browsing experiences, I've recently 
started using the Web Developer extension (click Tools, Extensions, Get 
More Extensions to find and install it)- it gives you a handy toolbar 
where you can edit css and see the effects on the fly, view the http 
response headers, resize your window to see how a page will look for 
people with 800x600 monitors, and lots more. Very handy for design work. 
A comparable tool for Internet Explorer is Accessible Information 
Solutions' Web Accessibility Toolbar 
(http://www.nils.org.au/ais/web/resources/toolbar/index.html), which has 
  more features for accessibility such as viewing your page as it will 
appear to colour-blind readers, and less for web design in general.PeterJuris G. Lidaka wrote:> 	Sorry, this is dumb and somewhat TANgential.  I've been browsing
