Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitSomebody a little while ago mentioned that IE 6 was better than previous 
version of Internet Explorer in its adherence to standards. We were 
talking at the time about XSL.In my experience the browser is quite poor at implementing other 
standards (e.g. CSS [Cascading Style Sheets]). Has this been other 
users' experience? It is particularly noticeable now that most other 
browsers are pretty good. It seems to be an odd version of the 80:20 
rule, except in this case that 80 percent of users use the browser that 
is least standards compliant while 80% of browsers probably are.-dan--
