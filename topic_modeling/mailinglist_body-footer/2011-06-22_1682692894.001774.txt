SDH 2011 Supporting the Digital Humanities:
Answering the unaskable17-18 November, CopenhagenFollowing the first successful SDH conference in Vienna in 2010, the CLARIN<h=
ttp://www.clarin.eu/> and DARIAH<http://www.dariah.eu/> initiatives have deci=
ded to jointly organise the second SDH conference in Copenhagen, Denmark in N=
ovember 2011. The conference venue will be at the University of Copenhagen, a=
 participant in both CLARIN and DARIAH.Digital technologies have the potential to transform the types of research qu=
estions that we ask in the Humanities, and to allow us to address traditional=
 questions in new and exciting ways, but ultimately they will also allow us t=
o answer questions that we were not even aware we could ask, hence the title =
of this conference. How can digital humanities help us not just to find the a=
nswers to our research questions more quickly and more easily, but also to fo=
rmulate research questions we would never have been able to ask without acces=
s to large quantities of digital data and sophisticated tools for their analy=
sis? Supporting the Digital Humanities will be a forum for the discussion of =
these innovations, and of the ways in which these new forms of research can b=
e facilitated and supported.CLARIN and DARIAH are creating European research infrastructures for the huma=
nities and related disciplines. SDH2011 aims to bring together infrastructure=
 providers and users from the communities involved with the two infrastructur=
e initiatives. The conference will consist of a number of topical sessions wh=
ere providers and users will present and discuss results, obstacles and oppor=
tunities for digitally-supported humanities research. Participants are encour=
aged to engage with honest assessments of the intellectual problems and pract=
ical barriers in an open and constructive atmosphere.The first SDH conference in 2010 gave a broad and multi-facetted presentation=
 of the domains of interest to CLARIN and DARIAH. This time we have chosen a =
somewhat more focussed approach, focussing on two major themes, but not exclu=
ding other themes of interest for the humanities. The two themes are:=C2=B7        Sound and movement - music, spoken word, dance and theatre
=C2=B7        Text and things - text, and the relationship between text and m=
aterial artefacts, such as manuscript, stone or other carriers of textSubmissions are invited for individual papers and posters, as well as panels.=
 Focus should be on tools and methods for the analysis of digital data rather=
 than on digitisation processes themselves, both from the provider and from t=
he user perspective. We want to pay special attention to inspiring showcases =
that demonstrate the innovative power of digital methods in the humanities.Some important dates:
July 15, 2011: Submission of suggestion for panels
July 24, 2011: Submission of abstracts (4 pages)
August 15, 2011: Notification on panel proposals
September 15, 2011: Author notification
