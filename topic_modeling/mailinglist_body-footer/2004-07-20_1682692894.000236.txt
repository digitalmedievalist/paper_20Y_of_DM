http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/ and using the left-hand menu=20
browse by language.  Sadly, trying to ignore that we=20
have one of these catalogued as "Anglo-Saxon", and another=20
catalogued as "English, Old".  The form is available from=20
any of the links saying 'request text'.  (If it says 'get=20
text' you can download it immediately.)  It is, again=20
unfortunately, still a form one must print out, sign, and=20
post/fax in.   If you detect in any of this an undertone=20
that I'm unhappy with our current website, you'd be right!
We are in the process of overhauling the whole OTA workflow=20
and both internal and external websites to all work together. =20
So one day this will all hopefully be a lot easier and use=20
open standards throughout.-James---
