rtant and what type of result you are looking for.James's answer to the question of OCR is bang on, so I'vw nothing to add ther=
e. And as those who've worked with me know, I'm a huge believer in wikis and =
use them all the time for various, sometimes unorthodox things. Crowd sourcin=
g proof reasing of flat texts a la Gutenberg is a pretty good example of what=
 they might be good at. Though I'd be worried in the case of unnegotiated cro=
ws sourcing about incremental version control--i.e. Not that you couldn't see=
 what changes had been made and reverse damage, but that the workflow would b=
e so cumbersome if people started indoing each others corrections that you'd =
lose any possible efficiencies.I find the belief in the power of agreed upon conventions quite touching  if =
somewhat other worldly. My experience, as an author, editor, journal editor, =
and scholar is that consistency of application in the absence of validation i=
s impossible. Even in single author works you tend to forget exactly the form=
at you used earlier for, for example, bibliographic format and I've seen too =
much minor variation among authors who were trying to follow say the chicago =
style to think that any conventions not subject to validation will be impleme=
nted consistently.However this is only important of you plan to do something other than print y=
our texts to the screen. And it is also possible to retrofit markup over proo=
f-read flat text.One last observation is that you can get double keyed text to a guaranteed ac=
curacy of 99.5 or higher for probably about $2-3 a page if you have sufficien=
t volume (99.995% and about $1.50/page for modern print). I'd now consider th=
at route before constructing any particular transcription scheme (there is so=
me hope that the TEI will be offering keying at these prices for smaller jobs=
 later as a membership benefit later this fall, so I've been paying attention=
 to prices lately).=20-----------

Subject: Re: [dm-l] Use of wikis for transcription
Date: July 28, 2009
Time: 5:4:51=20Thanks for these replies.  From work on other wikis, in particular=20
Wikipedia, I think1. Crowdsourcing very poor at anything involving summarisation, synthesis=20
and so on.  Hence Wikipedia is good at biographies (which have a set format, =and usually follow the progress of someone's life in the obvious order).=20
Very poor at high level subjects like 'History', 'Philosophy', 'Roman=20
Empire' and that sort of thing, where 95% of the work is sourcing the=20
relevant and important facts and so on.2.  There is no problem with conventions - co-editors generally quick to=20
absorb relevant policy, house style and so on (over much, in my view).3.  For these reasons, wikis well suited to translation work (which has=20
absolutely no demands on organisation or synthesis).4.  For similar reasons, transcription would also be well suited for wiki=20
work.5.  What originally drew me to the idea was finding an important medieval=20
work (a critical edition from the 1960's) in a London library where the=20
basement had clearly flooded at some time.  The volumes were out of order,=20
there were missing leaves, one volume was even missing.  Many important=20
works are not critical editions and are simply transcriptions made by=20
dedicated enthusiasts.  These are published in obscure journals like CIMAGL, =in courier font, generally not checked by others (in my view - it is easy to =locate mistakes), and generally not accessible to the outside world.6. Thus, publication on a wiki would ensure much better access to important=20
works, and also the opportunity for others to check.7.  Some here have commented on the use of character recognition, which I=20
find bizarre.  I studied optical pattern recognition in the 1980's and it=20
was accepted then, and it is still true I think, that machines cannot=20
understand human speech or writing unless they also grasp the semantics.  I=20
can work through a text without concentrating on the meaning and I can get=20
probably a 90% success rate.  Then I go through again, this time translating =as I go along and get a 98% success rate.  Finally I go one level higher (it =is philosophy I usually translate) and try to understand not just what the=20
writer is literally saying in their language, but what they actually mean,=20
the argument they are making.  This gets me to 99% but I am still learning.=20
It is very difficult to transcribe medieval texts without a deep=20
understanding of the *kind* of thing the writer is trying to say.  That is=20
because the writer was communicating with his or her (usually his) audience=20
knowing the assumptions they would make and which would not need to be=20
clarified.8.  To give an example, some years ago I hired a Cambridge PhD to help me=20
brush up my Latin.  We worked through some medieval texts and we got stuck=20
at 'Minor patet'.  He thought this meant 'it is less clear'.  In fact, as I=20
soon found out, 'Minor' in this context means 'the minor proposition' (of a=20
syllogism).9.  I did try out my OCR on a manuscript, but it was completely hopeless.=20
Only humans will ever be able to read these things.10.  Thanks for the tips about XML.  I do work with XML and indeed I have=20
made many experiments with trying to present images of manuscripts together=20
with the Latin transcript and then an English translation.  Another reason=20
for presenting the material like this is that we should no longer be hostage =to the person making a transcription, who is often interpreting the Latin in =a way that suits their interpretation of grammar and meaning.  It was not=20
until I started reading manuscripts that I realised how much of the printed=20
material we read is simply a typographer's invention.  For example medieval=20
texts do not generally use the honorific capital.  They write 'aristotle'=20
and even 'god', rather than 'Aristotle' or 'God'.  Actually they don't even=20
write the full word.  There are standard abbreviations for all the commonly=20
used words, such as Aristotle, Priscianus and so on.  The only way to=20
present this material is to give the original, a transcript in the original=20
language, and a translation into a modern language.EdwardDigital Medievalist --  http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/
