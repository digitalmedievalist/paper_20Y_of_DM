owship program seeks applications for the 2016-2017 academic year. Guided by =
the vision of its founders, Lawrence J. Schoenberg and Barbara Brizdle Schoen=
berg, SIMS aims to bring manuscript culture, modern technology, and people to=
gether to provide access to and understanding of our shared intellectual heri=
tage. Part of the Penn Libraries, SIMS oversees an extensive collection of pr=
e-modern manuscripts from around the world, with a special focus on the histo=
ry of philosophy and science, and creates open-access digital content to supp=
ort the study of its collections.  SIMS also hosts the Schoenberg Database of=
 Manuscripts<http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/schoenberg/index.html> and the =
annual Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age<http://w=
ww.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/lectures/ljs_symposium.html>.The SIMS Visiting Research Fellowships have been established to encourage res=
earch relating to the pre-modern manuscript collections at the University of =
Pennsylvania Libraries, including the Schoenberg Collection.  Affiliated with=
 the University of Pennsylvania, located near other manuscript-rich research =
collections (the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthrop=
ology, the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Chemical Heritage Foundation, an=
d the Rosenbach Museum and Library, among many others), and linked to the loc=
al and international scholarly communities, SIMS offers fellows a network of =
resources and opportunities for collaboration. Fellows will be encouraged to =
interact with SIMS staff, Penn faculty, and other medieval and early modern s=
cholars in the Philadelphia area. Fellows will also be expected to present th=
eir research at Penn Libraries either during the term of the fellowship or on=
 a selected date following the completion of the term.Applicants can apply to spend 1, 2, or 3 months at SIMS. Project proposals sh=
ould demonstrate that the Libraries' pre-modern manuscript resources are inte=
gral to proposed research topics. Recipients will be expected to work on-site=
 at Penn Libraries for the duration of their fellowship, excluding possible s=
hort research trips in support of the proposed project to nearby institutions=
. Proposals with a digital component are encouraged though not required. A to=
tal of $15,000 per year will be divided among up to 3 fellows in increments o=
f $5,000 per month. Awards must be used between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 20=
17.Applications are due May 15, 2016. For more information on eligibility and th=
e application process, go to: http://schoenberginstitute.org/visiting-researc=
h-fellowships.For more information on SIMS, go to http://schoenberginstitute.org/. For more=
