Words website, including:
- Dozens of digitized manuscripts newly-accessible in our IIIF-
  compliant viewer;
- Links to audio and video files used in the exhibition;- Full codicological descriptions as downloadable PDFs;- Multiple indices supplementing those in the print catalogue.These updates were accomplished thanks to the hard work of Hannah Weaver
(2017 Pforzheimer Fellow at Houghton Library) and our developer, Luke
Hollis of Archimedes Digital.
We invite you to visit the new and improved website at:
http://BeyondWords2016.org
We will continue to add to these resources as more manuscripts are
digitized and described, so check the website often for updates.
