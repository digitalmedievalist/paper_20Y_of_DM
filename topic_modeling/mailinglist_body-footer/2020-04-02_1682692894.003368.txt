I can't think of a single legitimate use for a font like this in a thesis. If=
 they're quoting a text they should just quote it. If they're reproducing a M=
S in facsimile, wouldn't a photo be better?On the other hand, for instructional materials, in print or on the web, it co=
uld be useful. Or just as a thing to have fun with. And as I said, it's stand=
ards compliant, so anyone flummoxed by it could simply copy and paste it into=
, say, a plain text editor.P.Professor and Director of Graduate Admissions

Subject: Re: [dm-l] A new secretary hand fontI've thought about this,and while my original comment was lighthearted, I thi=
nk that someone somewhere will probably submit their thesis in this font (or =
a similar or derivative font), and that's a good thing. I'd bet money that so=
meone will use the font for quotes from period texts in a thesis primarily in=
 a more modern font.What's the worst that can happen? A student submits their thesis in the font =
and most 'readers' have to use a screen reader? Sounds suspiciously like a re=
turn to the original context where many texts were read aloud for the benefit=
 of those who could not read.If history has shown us anything it is that we can't foresee the future life =
of texts or their reproduction ("Pride and Prejudice and Zombies" anyone?).Ng=C4=81 mihi

to:psb6m(a)virginia.edu>> escribi=C3=B3:With the usual apologies for cross-posting:Many of you know that in addition to my day job, I have a weird hobby of maki=
ng fonts for medievalists. This one is a little bit later than the Middle Age=
s, but may still be of interest.I have just released a font called "Joscelyn," which I call "an uncompromisin=
g secretary hand font" because, unlike any other secretary hand font I have s=
een, it makes no concessions to modernity. It is based on the main hand of Co=
rpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 488, John Joscelyn's Historiola Collegii =
Corporis Christi. The hand (not Joscelyn's own) is rather formal, and so less=
 difficult than many secretary hands, but it is as near as I've been able to =
come so far to an authentic reproduction of the hand.When I teach paleography, the most difficult bit for my students is always th=
e last--secretary hand. The idea behind this font is that a decent way to lea=
rn this difficult hand might be to (1) install the font, (2) start a Microsof=
t Word file by double-clicking an included template, (3) apply the "Joscelyn"=
 character style, (4) type whatever you like, and (5) just observe. The authe=
nticity of the font depends on seveal OpenType features being enabled, but th=
e template turns them on for you.At the risk of sounding immodest, I have to say that it's fun to type in this=
 font and see the OpenType features applied in real time--s changed into long=
 s, initial and final forms applied, and much more. And in addition, you can =
pass as much time as you like playing with the font without running the small=
est risk of contracting COVID-19!The font is free (licensed under the Open Font License). You can get it here:https://github.com/psb1558/Joscelyn-font/releasesStay well, everyone.Peter BakerProfessor and Director of Graduate Admissions
