projects, and some graphics projects. But what about things like
corpora, linguistic research, dictionaries, and other digital material
that are not intended as representations of primary sources? I can think
of some obvious examples (e.g. the DOE, I suppose the OED); but what
about projects on a smaller scale?Any ideas?-dan
