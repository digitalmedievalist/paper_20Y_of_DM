EDITING LATE-ANTIQUE AND EARLY MEDIEVAL TEXTS
PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES IIInternational Workshop
Gargnano sul Garda (University of Milan), 10-12 October 2022Call for Papers
This workshop continues the project inaugurated in 2017 in Lisbon (link<http:=
//www.tmp.letras.ulisboa.pt/cec-eventos-cientificos/cec-coloquios-e-congresso=
s/2623-editing-late-antique>), aiming at fostering and promoting the exchange=
 of ideas on how to edit late Antique and early Medieval texts (mostly Latin =
texts, but without excluding possible extensions to the Greek field). Young s=
cholars in particular will be encouraged to present case-studies and share th=
e editorial problems and methodological challenges that they had to face in o=
rder to fulfil their research or critical editions, in dialogue with more exp=
erienced scholars. As in the previous workshop, the centre of interest will b=
e troublesome issues, such as, for example:
- =E2=80=98open' or =E2=80=98fluid' texts
- Latin texts translated from another language, like Greek, or bilingual texts
- texts with variants by the author or in multiple recensions
- texts with linguistic instability
- texts transmitted by a huge number of manuscripts
- collections of extracts
- texts with a relevant indirect tradition.
