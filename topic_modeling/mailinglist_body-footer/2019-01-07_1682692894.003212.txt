24-25 April 2019
University of Miami, FLCall for Papers
This two-day symposium aims to bring together scholars and researchers=20
working with computational approaches to texts. The event targets a=20
broad audience interested in the application of digital text analysis=20
technology, as text mining, topic modeling, authorship detection,=20
writing style analysis, text reuse, or more generally tasks performed=20
through Natural Language Processing (NLP). These techniques have=20
significant potential not only for the study of literature but also for=20
the study of texts and language in general. The symposium aims to create=20
an open forum for showcasing these techniques.The event is also grounded in the idea that computational text analysis=20
should be integrated not only in the academic research by faculty and=20
their PhD students, but also in a pedagogical environment. The use of=20
computational analysis opens up new questions in literary studies, and=20
exposes students to many different ways of thinking about literature today.Computer-aided literary studies still thus tend to be focused on=20
literatures written in modern languages. NLP tools are quite developed=20
for modern languages, especially for the modern English language. For=20
medieval and premodern languages, due to their instability of=20
orthographic forms, attempts to conduct computer-aided (thus, to a=20
degree, systematic) research face many challenges to normalize and=20
standardize their linguistic forms. Therefore, the symposium also aims=20
to explore the use and challenge of using NLP tools for studying=20
literatures written in underrepresented and historical languages, such=20
as the medieval and premodern variants and precursors of Spanish,=20
French, Latin, and Dutch. Therefore, a special focus will be on the=20
preprocessing  routines available for these texts, such as=20
lemmatization, by which we collect inflected forms under a single item=20
or lemma, as well as challenges faced normalizing orthographic variation=20
of historical texts and other languages with unstable orthographies.=20
Among the international and national speakers we will have several=20
experts on the topic.Our envisioned program for the symposium is as follows: On the first=20
day, there will be several workshops, including one devoted to=20
integrating computer-assisted analysis in the classroom, which will=20
offer an introduction to stylometry, visualization, and text-reuse. On=20
the second day, there will be talks (30 min) that present ongoing=20
research projects, methodologies, and challenges. The subject languages=20
are preferably, but not limited to underrepresented and historical=20
languages.							=09We are specifically interested in receiving proposals for contributions=20
on one or more of the following topics:
Stylometry for authorship studiesStylometry as an approach to literary studyNatural Language Processing and linguistic annotationLemmatizers for underrepresented modern languages and old languages
Text reuse detectionNormalizationDistributional semanticsNetwork analysisText visualization
We especially welcome contributions from those working with any type of=20
textual corpora, preferably those conceived for a specific research and/=20
from a diachronic perspective. We conceive this symposium as an=20
opportunity to share (best)-practices and broaden conversation, thus=20
proposals can be on ongoing and experimental methodologies.
