Though I did not have anything to add in response, I learned a lot from the c=
onversation.I now have a quick question about Creative Commons attribution. For those of =
you using CC licenses (we are using CC-BY), I would be curious to know the fo=
llowing:*Do you give a recommended wording on your site as to how attribution could b=
e made? For example see this detailed example: http://graduates.treasury.gov.=
au/content/copyright.asp*Do you ask your users to make explicit when their work is derivative or simp=
le reproducing verbatim?We would like to help users unfamiliar with CC (the majority of our users) by=
 providing a short model attribute statement and I would like to find some go=
od examples to work from.thanks!Dave
