be taxing the system.There should be a server timeout that will stop any problematic or onerous
tasks.In any case, the server administrator should be able to log the cycles used
and if necessary, prescribe a quota or percentage of CPU power.-----Original Message-----

Hello all,
	I am posting this query on behalf of a colleague who has built a
neat 
little concordance maker: you drop text into it and almost immediately 
you get a kwic (Key Word in Context) concordance back. It did Beowulf in 
5 seconds.
	Is there anyway of determining bandwidth used by a program such as 
this? He is worried about overusing his university's resources.
