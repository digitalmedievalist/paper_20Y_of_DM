rams, between practices, and between members of its community. This theme inv=

l communities of use. It includes training in the TEI and related areas, for =

sses integration of TEI-encoded texts at scale, for example in libraries and =
large corpora, and acknowledges that new research questions and external deve=
lopments require continuous innovation.=20
