 proposals for its annual conference.The theme of the 2019 conference is Complexities. This theme has a multifacet=
ed connection with Digital Humanities scholarship. Complexities intends to in=
spire people to focus on DH as the humanist way of building complex models of=
 complex realities, analysing them with computational methods and communicati=
ng the results to a broader public. The theme also invites people to think of=
 the theoretical, social, and cultural complexity and diversity in which DH s=
cholarship is immersed and asks our community to interact consciously and cri=
tically in myriad ways, through the conference and the networks, institutions=
 and the enterprises interested in DH research. Finally, it means involving t=
he next generation, teaching DH to students - the people who will need to dea=
l with the complexities of the future.Proposals related to these themes are particularly welcome, but the Conferenc=
e will accept submissions on any other aspect or field of Digital Humanities.=
 Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
  *   Theoretical, epistemological, methodological or historical aspects of D=
igital Humanities;

uary 2019, with notice of acceptance by 3 March 2019.Proposal must be submitted via https://www.conftool.pro/dh2019/.DH2019 will use double-blind peer review. To facilitate this process, please =
remove all identifying information from your proposal submission including au=
thor name(s) and affiliation(s), project URLs, etc..When submitting proposals, previous Digital Humanities conference participant=
s and reviewers should use their existing ConfTool account rather than settin=
g up new ones. If you have forgotten your username or password, please contac=
t Program Committee Co-chairs Fabio Ciotti: fabio [dot] ciotti [at] uniroma2 =
[dot] it or Elena Pierazzo: elena [dot] pierazzo [at] univ-grenoble-alpes [do=
t] fr.To facilitate the production of the conference abstract book, authors of acce=
pted papers will be asked to submit final approved versions of their abstract=
s via the DHConvalidator, available through ConfTool, which creates a TEI tex=
t base of conference abstracts for further processing.Presenters are encouraged to familiarize themselves with Global Outlook::Digi=
tal Humanities' Translation Toolkit to prepare for a multilingual con=
ference. This includes guidelines and best practices for multilingual slides/=
posters/handouts and ad hoc community translation: http://go-dh.github.io/tra=
nslation-toolkit/conferences/.Similarly, participants are strongly encouraged to make themselves aware of c=
urrent recommendations for accessibility of presentations and multimedia-base=
d materials. Please review the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Initia=
tive Guidelines on Presentation Accessibility: https://www.w3.org/WAI/trainin=
g/accessible.II: TYPES OF PROPOSALSProposals may be of five types: (1) poster presentations; (2) short paper pre=
sentations; (3) long papers; (4) multiple-paper panels; (5) pre-conference wo=
rkshops and tutorials. Short paper and poster proposals are especially welcom=
e and, based on peer review and its mandate to create a balanced and varied p=
rogram, the Program Committee may offer acceptance in a different category fr=
om the one initially proposed. The committee will not normally accept more th=
an a total of two submissions from one primary or co-author. Papers and poste=
rs may be given in English, French, German, Italian or Spanish.All proposals should include relevant citations to sources in the appropriate=
 literature. Citations are not to be included in the word count. Additionally=
, proposals that concentrate on a particular tool or digital resource should =
cite non-digital as well as computer-based approaches to the problem.Poster Presentations
Poster proposals (abstract maximum: 750 words) may describe work on any speci=
fic topics or methods or present projects and software tools in any stage of =
development. Poster presentations are intended to be interactive with the opp=
ortunity to exchange ideas one-on-one with attendees.  Posters are in no way =
considered lesser forms of presentation at the DH conference and are subject =
to the same strict peer review as other presentation types. Submissions in th=
is category are strongly encouraged.Short Papers
Short paper proposals (abstract maximum: 1000 words) are intended to be dynam=
ic 10-minute presentations appropriate for reporting on experiments or works =
in progress or for describing tools or software in development. Short-paper s=
essions seek to open dialogues among scholars working on related topics. Shor=
t papers are in no way considered lesser forms of presentation at the DH conf=
erence and are subject to the same strict peer review as other presentation t=
ypes. Submissions in this category are strongly encouraged.Long Papers
Proposals for long papers (abstract maximum: 1500 words) should deal with sub=
stantial or completed research; report the development of significant new met=
hodologies or digital resources; or present rigorous theoretical, speculative=
, or critical discussions. Individual papers will be allocated 20 minutes for=
 presentation and 10 minutes for questions.
Proposals relating to the development of new computing methodologies or digit=
al resources should indicate how the methods are applied to research and/or t=
eaching in the humanities and what their impact has been in formulating and a=
ddressing research questions. They should also include critical assessments o=
f their application in the humanities as well as of the computing methodologi=
es used.Multiple Paper Panels
Panels (abstract maximum: 500 words for overview, plus 500 words for each pap=
er) should focus on a single theme and be inherently coherent in presenting a=
 substantial body of research or a research question. Panel submissions which=
 do not meet this criterion and which could function as individual papers wil=
l not normally be accepted. A panel should be conceived as a 90-minute sessio=
n of four to six speakers.
Since the conference offers an important occasion to attract new scholars fro=
m diverse backgrounds to specific research areas, those submitting proposals =
for panels are advised to ensure that the constitution of the panel reflects =
the constitution of the field and/or research topic that is being addressed a=
nd ADHO's expressed commitment to diversity or to explicitly address =
problems in those areas. In case the proposer's own network is too li=
mited, the Program Committee can advise them prior to submission on whom to c=
ontact to broaden the panel. Please contact the PC chairs Fabio Ciotti fabio =
[dot] ciotti [at] uniroma2 [dot] it or Elena Pierazzo elena [dot] pierazzo [a=
t] univ-grenoble-alpes [dot] fr if you need advice.Pre-Conference Workshops and Tutorials
Tutorials are normally half-day intensive introductions to specific technique=
s, software packages, or theoretical approaches with a small number of partic=
ipants. Workshop proposals may take many forms, including proposals with a fu=
ll slate of speakers and presentations, as well as proposals to issue an inde=
pendent call for papers from which submissions will be chosen. Participants i=
n pre-conference workshops and tutorials will be expected to register for the=
 full conference as well as pay a small additional fee to the conference. Wor=
kshops are expected to be self-financing in terms of hardware and software ne=
eds.Proposals should provide the following information:
  *   Title and brief description of the content or topic and its relevance t=
o the Digital Humanities community (not more than 1500 words);
  *   Full contact information for all tutorial instructors or workshop leade=
rs, including a one-paragraph statement summarizing their research interests =
and areas of expertise;
  *   Description of target audience and expected number of participants (bas=
ed, if possible, on past experience); and
  *   Special requirements for technical support.Additionally, tutorial proposals should include:
  *   A brief outline showing that the core content can be covered in a half-=
day (approximately 3 hours, plus breaks). In exceptional cases, full-day tuto=
rials may be supported.And workshop proposals must include:
  *   Intended length and format of the workshop (minimum half-day; maximum o=
ne-and-a-half days);
  *   Any special requirements for attendees, including software installation=
 (the conference will handle traditional technological support, but workshop =
organizers are expected to manage specific needs such as access to software, =
servers, etc.).
  *   If the workshop is to have its own call for participation, a deadline a=
nd date for notification of acceptances, and a list of individuals who have a=
greed to be part of the workshop's Program Committee.As with Multiple Paper Panel proposals, those submitting proposals for pre-co=
nference workshops are advised to ensure that the constitution of the worksho=
p reflects the constitution of the field and/or research topic that is being =
addressed and ADHO's expressed commitment to diversity, or explicitly=
 address problems in those areas.  In case the proposer's own network=
 is too limited, the Program Committee can advise them before submission on w=
hom to contact to broaden the panel. Please contact the PC chairs Fabio Ciott=
i fabio [dot] ciotti [at] uniroma2 [dot] it or Elena Pierazzo elena [dot] pie=
razzo [at] univ-grenoble-alpes [dot] fr if you need advice.N.B. Pre-conference workshops endorsed by ADHO Special Interest Groups (SIGs)=
 will be considered via separate calls put out by SIG conveners and will not =
be evaluated in the general academic program review process.III: ADHO CONFERENCE CODE OF CONDUCTThe Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) is dedicated to creat=
ing a safe, respectful, and collegial conference environment for the benefit =
of everyone who attends and for the advancement of research and scholarship i=
n fields supported by our constituent organizations. The ADHO Digital Humanit=
ies conference Code of Conduct is available at http://adho.org/administration=
/conference-coordinating-program-committee/adho-conference-code-conduct. All =
people submitting proposals to DH2018 should observe and uphold it.IV: VENUEDH2019 will take place at the TivoliVredenburg music theatre in the city cent=
re of Utrecht, the Netherlands, and is hosted by the Faculty of Humanities at=
 Utrecht University. The co-chairs of the local organization committee are Fr=
anciska de Jong and Joris van Eijnatten.V: BURSARIES FOR EARLY-CAREER AND EMERGING SCHOLARSThe Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations will offer a limited number =
of bursaries for early-career scholars presenting at the conference. Applicat=
ion guidelines will appear on the ADHO website early in 2019: http://www.adho=
