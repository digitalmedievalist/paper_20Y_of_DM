Languages and Cultures of Ancient Italy.Join us live at: <https://youtu.be/g9qCK6ntNPY>The languages of ancient Italy are fragmentarily attested and documented almo=
st exclusively in epigraphic texts. Recent advancements in information techno=
logies would make it possible to make their data available both within and be=
yond the limits of epigraphy, philology, and historical linguistics. The proj=
ect Languages and Cultures of Ancient Italy. Historical Linguistics and Digit=
al Models is a multidisciplinary research initiative which involves a consort=
ium established by the University Ca' Foscari of Venice, the Universi=
ty of Florence, and the Institute for Computational Linguistics of the Italia=
n National Research Council.The main objective of the project is to investigate chosen cultures of ancien=
t Italy, namely Venetic, Oscan, Faliscan, and Celtic, on the basis of the rel=
evant linguistic documentation, in order to show the forms of linguistic vari=
ability in Italy before romanisation. It will combine the traditional methods=
 of epigraphy and historical linguistics with digital tools adapted to the hi=
ghly fragmentary nature of the epigraphic documentation of such languages.The expected results of the project are:
=E2=80=93 producing a searchable digital corpus of the inscriptions containin=
g all the relevant contextual information together with their formal represen=
tation leveraging the TEI/EpiDoc encoding schema (may be necessary to create =
an ad-hoc schema for the peculiarities of such languages). This will ensure t=
he interoperability with other digital corpora and, thus, their availability =
for the whole research community and the general public;
=E2=80=93 creating a computational lexicon, linked with the corpus and based =
on a computational lexical model specifically dedicated to languages of fragm=
entary attestation;
=E2=80=93 experimenting a semantic codification by means of CRMtex, the exten=
sion of CIDOC CRM, the de facto standard ontology in the DH, for the represen=
tation of the texts.The corpus will include for each inscription an edition of the text, contextu=
al information, a commentary, a translation, searchable bibliographical refer=
ences, and possibly photographs and drawings.
