Conference Topics
The main topic of the AIUCD 2017 Conference is the use of big data methods, c=
ultural analytics and distant reading in the Humanities. We would like to exp=
lore the methodological and epistemological impact of these methods, their ap=
plication in the different fields of the Humanities and on various kinds of m=
edia and digital resources, their effects on our comprehension of cultural an=
d historical phenomena and, finally, their consequences and repercussions on =
the social and public perceptions of the Humanities.
We therefore encourage proposals on (but not limited to) the following topics:
  a.. Methodological and epistemological aspects of distant reading in the Hu=
manities  b.. Distant reading, close reading and scaled reading: relations and intera=
ctions between hermeneutical tradition, quantitative analysis and new computa=
tional methods  c.. Interaction and integration of methods of statistical/quantitative anal=
ysis and formal logic methods, semantic web technologies and linked data  d.. Quantitative and stylometry analysis, topic modelling and clustering fo=
r literary texts, archival documents and cultural objects  e.. Authorship attribution and automatic text classification  f.. Applications and experimentations of data mining methodologies in histo=
rical, artistic and archaeological research  g.. Network analysis and sentiment analysis applied to the Humanities  h.. Interaction between Natural Language Processing technologies and data m=
