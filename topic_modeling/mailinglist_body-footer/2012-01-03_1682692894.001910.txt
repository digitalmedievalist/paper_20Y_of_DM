", a three-week NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities t=
hat will be held at Tufts University (July 23 - August 10, 2012).
For further details see the previous announcement on the Perseus homepage: ht=
tp://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/"Tufts University invites applications to =E2=80=9CWorking with Text in a Dig=
ital Age=E2=80=9D, a three-week NEH Institute for Advanced Technology in the =
Digital Humanities (July 23-August 10, 2012) that combines traditional topics=
 such as TEI Markup with training in methods from Information Retrieval, Visu=
alization, and Corpus and Computational Linguistics.  Faculty, graduate stude=
nts, and library professionals are encouraged to apply.  Applicants should su=
bmit proposals by February 15, 2012.   Participant proposals must include CVs=
 and statements of purpose (no more than 1,000 words) describing how they wil=
l be able to use participation in the Institute to advance their subsequent c=
areers. Participants must be committed to collaborative work and to publicati=
on of results from this Institute under a Creative Commons license. Participa=
nts should identify source materials with which they propose to work during t=
he Institute and which must be in the public domain or available under a suit=

 intensive analysis and annotation and one or more larger corpora to be mined=
 and analyzed more broadly. Statements of purpose must describe initial goals=

ntact lcerrato(a)perseus.tufts.edu.We particularly encourage participants who are committed to developing resear=
ch agendas that integrate contributions and research by undergraduates, that =
expand the global presence of the Humanities, and that, in general, broaden a=
ccess to and participation in the Humanities. Preference will be given to par=
ticipants who are best prepared not only to apply new technologies but to do =
so as a means to transform their teaching and research and the relationship o=
f their work to society beyond academia."Happy New Year!
