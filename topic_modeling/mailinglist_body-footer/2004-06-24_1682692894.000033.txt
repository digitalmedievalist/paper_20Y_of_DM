A couple of publications are in process that should help answer this
question. The first is the _Blackwell Companion to Digital
Humanities_,
edited by Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens and John Unsworth, to be
published
in Nov 2004:

(Unfortunately, this one will cost about $150, but perhaps you can
convince
your library to purchase it.)Julia Flanders, as part of an NEH grant, is editing a guide to
encoding
early printed books, with plans to include plenty of good advice about
encoding in general. Preliminary report at:
