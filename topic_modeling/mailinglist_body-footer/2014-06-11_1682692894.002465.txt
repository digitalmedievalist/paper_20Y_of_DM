Deadline: Jul 11, 2014SPECIAL CALL FOR SPECIAL SESSION:=E2=80=9CThe State of 3D Modeling of Cultural Heritage
in the Age of Augmented Reality, Xbox Kinect, UAVs, and the Oculus Rift=E2=80=
=9Dat the Conference on Cultural Heritage and New Technologies (CHNT:=20
http://www.chnt.at/), Vienna, Nov. 3-5, 2014The purpose of this session is to take stock of the current state of=20
the art of 3D modeling of cultural heritage objects of all scales (from=20
a vase or statue, to a building or an entire landscape). It seems=20
particularly opportune to do so in light of the dramatically lower=20
costs of devices for 3D data capture and display. Papers fitting one or=20
more of the following three descriptions would be especially welcome:=20
(1) cultural heritage projects exploiting Augmented Reality and/or=20
immersive, 3D display devices such as the Oculus Rift
(2) projects collecting 3D data using low-cost devices and methods such=20
as SfM, Kinect or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(3) 3D modeling projects (especially those involving reconstructions)=20
that have as their goal not simply illustrating previously existing=20
knowledge of the past but serving as tools to see or understand=20
features of the past that can only emerge after we have made the 3D=20
model. Papers should concentrate less on the =E2=80=9Chow=E2=80=9D of 3D mode=
ling=20
(fairly well understood by now) than on the =E2=80=9Cwhy=E2=80=9D (i.e., what=
 is the=20
scientific gain in knowledge that results from applying the new=20
technology?).Topics falling into category (1) should, whenever possible, provide the=20
results of summative assessment: we are interested not simply in bright=20
ideas and clever demonstrations but in proof of concept or full-scale=20
deployment. For example, if a  claim is made that AR can help promote=20
better public understanding of cultural heritage, did the pilot AR=20
project actually produce measurably positive results?Topics falling into category (2) should ideally include a comparison of=20
the results of using low-cost and high-end data gathering devices. What=20
are the strengths and weaknesses of the low-cost approach? Is a=20
low-cost device good for certain cultural heritage applications but not=20
others? For example, we welcome a paper comparing the resolution and=20
accuracy of 3D meshes of a statue resulting from a SfM approach vs. one=20
resulting from traditional scanning.
Papers of two lengths are invited: short (fifteen minutes, or less);=20
and long (twenty minutes). Applicants should indicate the length of=20
time they would need for their presentation.Each paper, no matter its length, will be followed by five minutes of=20
discussion and debate. To facilitate a lively discussion of the papers=20
in Vienna, all participants are required to circulate a written draft=20
of their talks to the other participants no later than October 1, 2014.The papers accepted will be published as a special issue in Digital=20
Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage, a new online,=20
peer-reviewed journal started in 2012 by the organizers. For details,=20

submitted by noon CET on Friday, July 11, 2014. Abstracts should be=20
