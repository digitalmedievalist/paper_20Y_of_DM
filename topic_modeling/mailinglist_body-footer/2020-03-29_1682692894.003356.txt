to:psb6m(a)virginia.edu>> escribi=C3=B3:With the usual apologies for cross-posting:Many of you know that in addition to my day job, I have a weird hobby of maki=
ng fonts for medievalists. This one is a little bit later than the Middle Age=
s, but may still be of interest.I have just released a font called "Joscelyn," which I call "an uncompromisin=
g secretary hand font" because, unlike any other secretary hand font I have s=
een, it makes no concessions to modernity. It is based on the main hand of Co=
rpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 488, John Joscelyn's Historiola Collegii =
Corporis Christi. The hand (not Joscelyn's own) is rather formal, and so less=
 difficult than many secretary hands, but it is as near as I've been able to =
come so far to an authentic reproduction of the hand.When I teach paleography, the most difficult bit for my students is always th=
e last--secretary hand. The idea behind this font is that a decent way to lea=
rn this difficult hand might be to (1) install the font, (2) start a Microsof=
t Word file by double-clicking an included template, (3) apply the "Joscelyn"=
 character style, (4) type whatever you like, and (5) just observe. The authe=
nticity of the font depends on seveal OpenType features being enabled, but th=
e template turns them on for you.At the risk of sounding immodest, I have to say that it's fun to type in this=
 font and see the OpenType features applied in real time--s changed into long=
 s, initial and final forms applied, and much more. And in addition, you can =
pass as much time as you like playing with the font without running the small=
est risk of contracting COVID-19!The font is free (licensed under the Open Font License). You can get it here:https://github.com/psb1558/Joscelyn-font/releasesStay well, everyone.Peter BakerProfessor and Director of Graduate Admissions
