underused aspect of repositories.Something else to think about, which a number of journals are now in the 
process of considering, is /publishing/ your data. At Digital 
Medievalist and at Digital Studies (two journals I'm associated with) 
the editorial boards are trying to work out the best way of doing this, 
as well as discussing its implications for peer review and quality 
assurance. I understand that Digital Humanities Quarterly has already 
started publishing datasets (and in fact I have an action item on me to 
find out how they've resolved some of these issues). The Journal of Open 
Archaeology Data (JOAD) is a commercial project that is already handling 
things like transcriptions, visualisation sets, scans, and the like, 
though I'm told they have pretty significant page charges.Publishing data means that it is citable as well as reusable, and the 
journals that are publishing them are using adherence to archival 
standards as a refereeing criteria. JOAD requires you to have put your 
data in a repository and received a DOI (Digital Object Identifier), 
which you then pass on to them. If your institutional repository doesn't 
give datasets DOIs (ours doesn't, unfortunately), an alternative is to 
submit your datasets to figshare.com, which is a free repository service 
that will give out DOIs. My only concern about figshare is that is is 
run by a recent postdoc and I'm not sure what his long-term preservation 
strategy is.One reason for publishing datasets is that it means they are 
discoverable: I heard a talk by a data librarian at Beyond the PDF2 this 
past Spring in Amsterdam that examined all references to publicly 
available datasets mentioned in articles since 1990 or so in some 
specific natural science discipline: 90% were now irrecoverable, mostly 
because the URLs were broken: the PIs had died, changed institutions, or 
reorganised their webspace, without indicating where the material had moved.If somebody is interested in publishing citable datasets along the lines 
of JOAD, I believe that both DM-J (the Digital Medievalist Journal) and 
Digital Studies are interested in experimenting. This is a very hot 
topic in publishing circles, and it is gaining some traction in DH, 
where we lag behind the natural scientists.
