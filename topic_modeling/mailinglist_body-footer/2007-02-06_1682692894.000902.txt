you know the basics of TEI but you'd like to learn more about
manuscript description and customization of TEI, please feel free to
register only for the second session. On the other hand, if you aren't
familiar with the TEI and would like some instruction in the basics,
you can register for the second session. Of course I would encourage
anyone who takes the first to take the second one as well  :-)Thanks,
