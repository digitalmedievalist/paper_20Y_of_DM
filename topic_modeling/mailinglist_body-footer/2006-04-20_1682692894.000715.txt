several related lists for later searching and reference, although the 
propriety even of this seems a little dubious. But I see no
point at all to distributing the kind of daily digest that you
picture. To me it would simply be one more over-large message
to threaten my mail quota and be deleted (the "D" key in Pine,
of course). I dislike digest formats in general: the messages
are large, hard to scroll through, very hard to filter successfully,
and make it difficult either to follow a thread or (more important) to 
ignore the many threads in which one has no interest or expertise.pfs--------------------------------------------------------------------
