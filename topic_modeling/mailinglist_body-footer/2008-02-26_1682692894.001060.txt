 Rare and Special Bytes: Special Collections in the Digital Age
 June 24-27, 2008 | Los Angeles, California
 Hosted by UCLA and the Getty Research Institute Register and book your hotel room early, the last two RBMS
Preconferences have sold out! Registration is now open for the 49th Annual RBMS Preconference.
Digitization is a hot topic in all libraries, but has unique
implications for special collections repositories. We face increasing
pressure to provide digital objects for the classroom and for
researchers, yet mass digitization is generally not an option. This
preconference will explore a wide range of exciting and vexing issues
pertaining to the digitization of special collections, including the
selection of materials, improving access, copyright and licensing, and
the use of digitized materials. Full-day workshops will be offered on
Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) and the Descriptive Cataloging of
Rare Materials (Books). For program, registration, and housing information, please visit:

attendees. Late registration charges apply after May 21. We look forward to seeing you in Los Angeles! Kris Kiesling, 2008 RBMS Preconference Program Chair
