Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Harriet,The degree to which images are described in TEI and the frequency varies=20
of course as much as there are projects creating manuscript=20
descriptions. A higher standardization and deeper structuring of the=20
content of <decoDesc>s and <decoNote>s is desirable - but hard to=20
achieve for the lack of a common terminology or taxonomy and not least=20
for the lack of expertise of cataloguers.BTW, there is a selected bibliography on decoration of manuscripts by=20
Hanna Vorholt available on the DiXiT webpage (course material of MMSDA=20
2014):

>>
>> - Moved the MySQL database to the new server. Verified that the

>>
>> - Verified that Port 3306 is open so the database can be managed remotely.
>>
>> - Installed the Actual Technologies ODBC Driver, created a new DSN
>> for the MySQL database, and verified that we can connect to the
>> MySQL database using ODBC.
>>
>> - Updated the FileMaker Pro scripts to use the new DSN we created.
>>
>> I can confirm that the MySQL database can be modified in FileMaker
>> Pro via ODBC (I created a new FileMaker Pro database to test this),
>> but something in the scripts in the existing FileMaker Pro database
