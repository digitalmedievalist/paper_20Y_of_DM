If there is no objection from list members, I'll put dm-l on the

This is a script for the DEbian FOnt MAnager (defoma) program. The 
Debian maintainer creates it, and I'm afraid I know nothing more about 
it, except that I suppose you don't need defoma if you've got FontConfig.>3. I'm very glad to see that Junicode is slowly but surely becoming a

It would be best to get requests into MUFI first. You can direct any 
requests for inclusion of characters to me, since I'm involved with 
MUFI; then as soon as MUFI assigns a code point I'll include it in Junicode.>4. I really like the (oldish) Beowulf-1 font, any plans to revamp it or

I've thought about this. Since there's a large number of ligatures it 
would seem a good candidate for an OpenType font. But life's so short . . .>Again on Junicode under Linux: Debian offers excellent support, the

I really appreciate your packaging Junicode for Mandrake (and thence it 
is available to all who use RPM-based Linux distributions.Peter
