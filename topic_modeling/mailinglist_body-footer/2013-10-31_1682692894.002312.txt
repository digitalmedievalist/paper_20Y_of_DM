APPLICATIONAcademic Requirements:Early-Stage Researchers must be in the first 4 years of their research =20
careers and not yet have a doctoral degree. This is measured from the =20
date when they obtained the degree which would formally entitle them =20
to embark on a doctorate, irrespective of whether or not a doctorate =20
is envisaged.Experienced Researchers must be in possession of a doctoral degree or =20
have at least 4 years of full-time equivalent research experience. At =20
the time of recruitment by the host organisation an experienced =20
researcher must also have less than 5 years of full-time equivalent =20
research experience.It should be noted that an individual researcher may not be recruited =20
first as an ESR and subsequently as an ER in the same project.

trans-national mobility (i.e. move from one country to another) when =20
taking up their appointment. One general rule applies to the =20

not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, =20
etc) in the country of their host organisation for more than 12 months =20
in the 3 years immediately prior to the reference date.Short stays such as holidays and/or compulsory national service are =20
not taken into account.

regardless of gender, ethnicity or country of origin are welcome if =20
they meet the eligibility requirements.Applicants should send their applications directly to the institution =20
hosting the desired fellowship. Applications for more than one post =20
