citation-management services to their members, rather than a package for
personal citation management. Managing circulation is another problem;
you might want to look into LibraryThing (an online commercial personal
library management system) or, if you're a Mac user, try Delicious
Library. http://www.librarything.com/http://www.delicious-monster.com/I haven't gone into these in detail, but my sense is that what you gain
in collection management, you lose in full-featured academic citation
formatting. There's some interesting work going in the OpenOffice group on
developing the citation management system to handle citations the way
academics need to, in a solid standards-based way that allows
interoperability with other bibliographic systems. There's lots of
information on their wiki:http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Bibliographic_Software_and_Stan

Subject: RE: [dm-l] RefworksPeter,This is primarily library software... though it looks VERY good from the
screenshots and in my case, I've been using my citation manager also as
a circulation manager (it's a long story, but... I was getting tired of
swearing I wouldn't lend books, doing it anyway, and then losing them,
so I dicided instead to LoC them, but card pockets in the back and make
people "sign them out"--works like a charm).Do you know/does anybody here use this as a personal citation manager?-dOn Fri, 2006-24-02 at 11:22 -0700, Binkley, Peter wrote:
