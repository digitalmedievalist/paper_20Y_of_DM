board is discussing specific changes to its organization, and we need your fe=
edback on this matter.This mail is to inform you that the board is debating changes to the bylaws o=
f our organization. As a subscriber to the dm-list, you are a member of digit=
al medievalist, and we want to hear from you.The motivation behind the changes to the bylaws are the following:  *   We want to stress that digital medievalist is an inclusive and open lea=
rned society that holds itself to certain standards and academic rigor.
  *   For reasons of administration and organization, we propose to alter the=
 terms of the executive board. From our point of view, it is too time-consumi=
ng to organize elections every year.
  *   The excellent subcommittee (formally called postgraduate committee) nee=
ds a written foundation; we, therefore, want to add specific bylaws for the c=
ommittee.As is laid out in our bylaws, we are obliged to give you a chance to comment =
on the proposed amendments (and frankly, we are very eager to get your feedba=
ck). Feel free to comment directly to the list or send one of the board membe=
rs a message (https://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com/about/executive-board/=
).After this call for comments (open for ten days), the executive board will co=
nsider the feedback and propose new bylaws. All members of digital medievalis=
t will have a chance to vote on the new bylaws by the end of March/beginning =
of April (announced through the mailing list).For your consideration, I attach two PDF documents with
a) a proposition for amendments to the digital medievalist bylaws [https://an=
nuel2.framapad.org/p/digital-medievalist-by-laws-9suk]
b) a proposition for new bylaws for the subcommittee [https://annuel2.framapa=
d.org/p/bylaws-for-post-graduate-committee-9suk]
Both propositions are also open for comments online (link to a framapad/open =
document)I am very much looking forward to your feedback and send best wishes in the n=
ame of the executive board,Tobias**********************************Prof. Dr. Tobias Hodel
