NICET in Argentina
  *   Dan O'Donnell, Professor of English, University of LethbridgeSpeakers from around the globe will be presenting in this centerpiece plenary=
 session
Much of today's debate around open access and scholarly communication=
 in Northern America and Europe centers around how well plans developed in on=
e part of this =E2=80=9CNorth Atlantic=E2=80=9D region might work in another,=
 or, usually as an afterthought, in the =E2=80=9CGlobal South=E2=80=9D. In th=
is session we want to turn this on its head. What would scholarly communicati=
on be like if our origin myth did not start in the UK's Royal Society=
 in London in 1665? Let's imagine a world where Phil Trans never exis=
ted and we instead had developed our systems from the ideas underpinning the =
success stories of scholarly communications infrastructures and systems from =
Latin America, Asia and Africa, from beyond the English-speaking world, and f=
rom communities not traditionally considered as =E2=80=9Cscholarly=E2=80=9D.Thursday, August 8, 2019

elines move the needle?
Speaker: Juan Pablo Alperin<https://force11.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=
=3D5e2d2ee75f2d3afd1d39a666d&id=3D6e3559eed5&e=3D2e694a8dc5>, Assistant Profe=
ssor in Publishing and Co-Director of the Scholarly Communications Lab
Despite all the arguments and evidence in favor of open scholarship, years of=
 advocacy, tool building, mandates, and policies, less than half of the resea=
rch that is published is publicly available. But what if we could magically a=
dd open scholarship practices as a valued activity in every salary review and=
 tenure guideline document? Would such an explicit valuation of open scholars=
hip for academic career advancement serve to move the needle? This presentati=
on will challenge commonly held notions of the barriers to change through evi=
dence from the analysis of hundreds of salary review and tenure guideline doc=
uments from universities in the United States and Canada, and from results of=
 a survey of faculty from the same universities. This empirical exploration o=
f what we say we value in academic careers, how we say it, and what we think =
our peers value may confirm your belief that review, promotion, and tenure pr=
ocesses affect the adoption of open scholarship practices=E2=80=94but it just=
 won't be in the way you think they do.
