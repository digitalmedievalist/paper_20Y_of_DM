Our edition of the 'Geraardsbergse handschrift' (Geraardsbergen 
Miscellany) is based on a TEI encoded XML file where text structure is 
used to define the hierarchy, and pages are encoded as pb-elements 
(milestones). Nevertheless, we present our edition on a page by page basis.The edition is available at 
http://www.chi.knaw.nl/epub/mvn/geraardsbergen/index.html. I'm afraid 
everything is in Dutch right now, but from the 'Inleiding' 
(introduction) option, the xml and xslt source files are available. The 
edition pages can be accessed from the 'editie' (edition) or 'inhoud' 
(contents) option. On some pages (e.g. 
http://www.chi.knaw.nl/epub/mvn/geraardsbergen/f109r.html), there's also 
a facsimile.(We'll create full facsimile-cum-transcription editions in the future; 
this one is a book based publication, converted into digital form 
recently).In the present edition, performance is not an issue, as the pages 
contain static html. If I were to write this stylesheet again, in the 
interest of performance and clarity, I would separate the milestone 
handling from producing the final output. I'd use an intermediate 
stylesheet to transform the milestone elements into full page elements 
at the highest level of the hierarchy. These page elements would contain 
those segments of the text, div, p (etc.) elements that the associated 
page contains. The resulting XML file, would, I'm sure, perform 
beautifully in a dynamic environment.Peter
