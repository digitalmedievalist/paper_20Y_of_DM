Editing Old English: =C3=86lfric's Lives of the Saints
Special Session at the 47th International Congress on Medieval Studies (May 2=
012)2012 marks the 100-year anniversary of the death of W. W. Skeat, the eminent =
lexicographer and editor of Anglo-Saxon texts. Skeat is known among =C3=86lfr=
ic scholars as the editor of the four-volume Lives of Saints (1881-1890). Thi=
s edition has numerous limitations, including an incomplete scholarly apparat=
us, a dated translation, and infrequent availability.  A new edition is neede=
d - but what would it look like?  Who would it be for?This session will feature papers that examine Skeat's editorial choices and l=
ook towards what is needed for a future edition.Please send abstracts of around 300 words to Grant Simpson at glsimpso(a)indi=
ana.edu by September 15. (Early submissons would be much appreciated.)--===============9092810097303171323==
