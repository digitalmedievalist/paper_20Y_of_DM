nt LAnguages (LT4HALA 2022)###- Website: https://circse.github.io/LT4HALA/2022
- START submission site: https://www.softconf.com/lrec2022/LT4HALA/
- Place: co-located with LREC 2022, Marseille, France
- Date: 25 June 2022 (post-conference workshop)##DESCRIPTION##
LT4HALA 2022 is a one-day workshop that seeks to bring together scholars who =
are developing and/or are using Language Technologies (LTs) for historically =
attested languages, so to foster cross-fertilization between the Computationa=
l Linguistics community and the areas in the Humanities dealing with historic=
al linguistic data, e.g. historians, philologists, linguists, archaeologists =
and literary scholars. LT4HALA 2022 follows LT4HALA 2020 that was organized i=
n the context of LREC 2020 (proceedings: https://aclanthology.org/volumes/202=
0.lt4hala-1/). Despite the current availability of large collections of digit=
ized texts written in historical languages, such interdisciplinary collaborat=
ion is still hampered by the limited availability of annotated linguistic res=
ources for most of the historical languages. Creating such resources is a cha=
llenge and an obligation for LTs, both to support historical linguistic resea=
rch with the most updated technologies and to preserve those precious linguis=
tic data that survived from past times.
Relevant topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:
- handling spelling variation;
- detection and correction of OCR errors;
- creation and annotation of digital resources;
- deciphering;
- morphological/syntactic/semantic analysis of textual data;
- adaptation of tools to address diachronic/diatopic/diastratic variation in =
texts;
- teaching ancient languages with NLP tools;
- NLP-driven theoretical studies in historical linguistics;
- evaluation of NLP tools.##SHARED TASKS##
LT4HALA 2022 will hosts two shared tasks:
- the second edition of EvaLatin, an evaluation campaign entirely devoted to =
the evaluation of NLP tools for Latin. The second edition of EvaLatin will fo=
cus on three tasks (i.e. Lemmatization, PoS tagging, and Morphological Featur=
e Identification), each featuring three sub-tasks (i.e. Classical, Cross-Genr=
e, Cross-Time).
- the first edition of EvaHan, the first evaluation campaign for the evaluati=
on of NLP tools for Ancient Chinese. EvaHan first edition has one task (i.e. =
a joint task of Word Segmentation and POS Tagging).Training data for both shared tasks are available on the conference website:
- EvaLatin 2022 training data: https://circse.github.io/LT4HALA/2022/EvaLatin=
#training-data
- EvaHan 2022 training data: https://circse.github.io/LT4HALA/2022/EvaHan#tra=
ining-dataTest data will be available on the web pages of the two shared tasks at the f=
ollowing URLs:
- EvaLatin 2022 test data (available after March 17th): https://circse.github=
.io/LT4HALA/2022/EvaLatin#test-data
- EvaHan 2022 test data  (available after March 31st): https://circse.github.=
io/LT4HALA/2022/EvaHan#test-data##SUBMISSIONS##
For the workshop, we invite papers of different types such as experimental pa=
pers, reproduction papers, resource papers, position papers, survey papers. B=
oth long and short papers describing original and unpublished work are welcom=
e. Long papers should deal with substantial completed research and/or report =
on the development of new methodologies. They may consist of up to 8 pages of=
 content plus 2 pages of references. Short papers are instead appropriate for=
 reporting on works in progress or for describing a singular tool or project.=
 They may consist of up to 4 pages of content plus 2 pages of references.
We encourage the authors of papers reporting experimental results to make the=
ir results reproducible and the entire process of analysis replicable, by mak=
ing the data and the tools they used available. The form of the presentation =
may be oral or poster, whereas in the proceedings there is no difference betw=
een the accepted papers. The submission is NOT anonymous. The LREC official f=
ormat is requested. Each paper will be reviewed but three independent reviewe=
rs.
As for EvaLatin and EvaHan, participants will be required to submit a technic=
al report for each task (with all the related sub-tasks) they took part in. T=
echnical reports will be included in the proceedings as short papers: the max=
imum length is 4 pages (excluding references) and they should follow the LREC=
 official format. Reports will receive a light review (we will check for the =
correctness of the format, the exactness of results and ranking, and overall =
exposition). All participants will have the possibility to present their resu=
lts at the workshop: we will allocate an oral session and a poster session fu=
lly devoted to the shared tasks in the afternoon.##IMPORTANT DATES##

- Describing your LRs in the LRE Map is now a normal practice in the submissi=
on procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other conferences). T=
o continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about =E2=80=9CSharing LRs=E2=
=80=9D (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will have the possibility, =
 when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC repository.  This e=
ffort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, may become=
 a new =E2=80=9Cregular=E2=80=9D feature for conferences in our field, thus c=
ontributing to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and sh=
are data.
- As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as to =
allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate the ex=
periments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2022 endorses the need to uniq=
uely Identify LRs through the use of the International Standard Language Reso=
urce Number (ISLRN, www.islrn.org<http://www.islrn.org>), a Persistent Unique=
 Identifier to be assigned to each Language Resource. The assignment of ISLRN=
s to LRs cited in LREC papers  will be offered at submission time.##Workshop Organizers##
