is there a need for a similar-but-different resource that isn't

Quoting Daniel Paul O'Donnell <daniel.odonnell(a)gmail.com>:> I'm sure this has come up before, but as part of something I'm  
> working on, I've come across a whole trove of early (i.e. mid-1990s)  
> on-line editions. In this case often designed as class projects and  
> entirely non-medieval.
>
> This makes me wonder if there is a "hidden corpus" of medieval  
> digital editions out there--either still available on some murky  
> corner of the web or lost due to restructuring of URLs at host  
> institutions.
>
> I wonder if it would be interesting to collect as big a bibliography  
> of these as we could. If it turned out that there were hundreds, I'm  
> sure I could whip together a web-form to allow bibliographic entry.  
> But to start, what do people know of?
