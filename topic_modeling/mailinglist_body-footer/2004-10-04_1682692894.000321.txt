	Now that the website is up and running, I'd like to propose a 
commission for the list: let's start writing a primer on humanities 
computing for medievalists.	What I'm thinking of is using the wiki to write individual "chapters" 
and then combine them using a table of content wiki entry. This would 
also allow us to reuse "chapters" in different contexts (e.g. someone 
could add a TOC for "encoding medieval music" and reuse several already 
existing chapters).	Since this would be a collaborative effort, the precise contents would 
be a fluid and collective decision. I can only know what I'd like to see 
(or wish I had seen some time in the past):-imaging: what it involves, whether I should/can scan from slides (what 
format), how much sharpening or colour-adjustment I ought to do, etc.-Fonts: what is unicode? how do I access it? are there other systems? 
where do I find fonts? are their standards? how do I encode fonts in my 
web pages (not I am being deliberately naive here).-Markup: structural vs. display vs. wordprocessing vs. text files: 
what's the difference? What should I keep in mind if I start a project? 
Why should I bother distinguishing between different types of italics 
using structural markup? Do I *have* to learn TEI?-Project management: what is the typical life of a medieval computing 
project? what kind of funding and/or expertise would I need? Can I do it 
on my own? are there resources/books I should know about? Is there 
advice for publishing out the other end?There are obviously many more questions and sub-questions one could ask.Is this something people would be interested in? Any suggestions for 
possible topics? Volunteers to start writing?The only thing I would ask if you are willing is that you sign your 
contributions by signing into the Wiki before editing. You don't have 
to, but this isn't a pure wiki: we are a collection of largely 
professional scholars whose business depends on responsibility. This 
would also allow us, if we were extremely pleased with the results, to 
publish a parallel version in some other format--assuming that's not a 
bad idea in some way I can't see.I am willing to coordinate activities to the extent that that is 
necessary. My first inclination, however, is to propose the project and 
see what happens. Other ideas? Suggestions for getting started?-dan
