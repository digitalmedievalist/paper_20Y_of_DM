matic restoration of ancient Greek inscriptionsFri, Jun 5, 2020, 17:30 (UK time)
Institute of Classical Studies, University of London
Online seminar, streamed live and archived at: https://youtu.be/nKSfzHYmLtQAncient History relies on Epigraphy, the study of ancient inscribed texts (ca=
lled "inscriptions"), for evidence of the recorded past. However, inscription=
s are often damaged over the centuries, and illegible parts of the text must =
be restored by epigraphists. PYTHIA is the first ancient text restoration mod=
el that recovers missing characters from a damaged text input using deep neur=
al networks. Its architecture is carefully designed to handle long-term conte=
xt information, and deal efficiently with missing or corrupted character and =
word representations. I will present this research, give examples of PYTHIA a=
t work, and demonstrate how to use the model for personal research.ALL WELCOME=3D=3D
