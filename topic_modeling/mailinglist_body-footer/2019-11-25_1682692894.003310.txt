understand our constituency, and its interests and expectations. We have
used the survey results to guide our decisions and better represent the DM
community. A significant issue that was highlighted by the survey was a
certain lack of participation by part of (post-)graduate students and early
career researchers.We have decided to tackle the problem by instituting a new subcommittee of
students and early career scholars to work in parallel to the Executive
Board, aiming at engaging with their peers and help the board in its
activities.We have invited 8 outstanding and enthusiastic candidates to be part of
this first instalment of the subcommittee. I will work as a liaison between
the two boards to guarantee active communication and collaboration between
the two boards.If the experiment will be successful—and I am confident it will!—we would
like to call on the community once more to update the bylaws and make the
subcommittee an official branch of DM, with regular calls for nominations
and elections, as it is for the Executive Board.Allow me, therefore, to introduce the members of the subcommittee (in
alphabetical order):Hannah Busch: PhD candidate studying the application of Artificial
Intelligence for the study of medieval Latin palaeography, at Huygens ING,
Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.Nathan Daniels: PhD candidate in History at Johns Hopkins University,
studying Parisian guilds, urban space and topography, with related
interests in digital editions of historical texts, linked open data, and
mapping.Selina Galka: currently finishing the Joint-Masters-Degree in German
Medieval Philology and studying the MA “Digital Humanities” at the
Karl-Franzens-University Graz.Tessa Gengnagel: PhD candidate at the University of Cologne, with a
background in History and Latin Philology of the Middle Ages and an
interest in digital scholarly editions of non-textual materials.James Harr, III: PhD student focusing on medieval media studies,
petitionary networks, and material semiotics in the Communication,
Rhetoric, and Digital Media program at North Carolina State University.Aylin Malcolm: PhD candidate studying medieval literature and science,
including digital editions of scientific manuscripts, at the University of
Pennsylvania.Caitlin Postal: PhD student caught between medieval literature, material
culture, temporality, and digitality at the University of Washington.Daniela Schulz studied History and English in Cologne, with a focus on
medieval history, and also received some training in what’s now commonly
called “Digital Humanities”. She is writing a doctoral thesis focusing on
the digital edition of an early medieval Roman law text.
