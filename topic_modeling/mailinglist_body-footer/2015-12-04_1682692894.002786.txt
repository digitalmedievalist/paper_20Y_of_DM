> Those of you whose collections include a leaf or two of the Beauvais
> Missal may be interested in my ongoing online project devoted to
> reconstructing and studying the manuscript:
>
> http://brokenbooks2.omeka.net
>
> On the site, you will find images and metadata for 94 known leaves of
> the manuscript as well as initial findings about the Missal and a link
> to a digital surrogate (a test case for the University of St. Louis
> Center for Digital Humanities' Broken Books [1]project).
>
> Please contact me you have any questions about the project or your
> leaf's metadata, or if you know of any leaves of the Missal that I
> haven't included. In addition, if your leaf has an OPAC record, please
> feel free to send me the PURL so I can include it.

> Many thanks -
