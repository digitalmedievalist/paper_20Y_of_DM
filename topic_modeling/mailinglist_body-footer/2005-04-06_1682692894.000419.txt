> <div>
> <pb n="1"/>
> <head>First text</head>
> <p n="1">some text starts here and goes ita<hi rend="italic">lic an<pb
> n="2"/>d then</i> we get a pagebreak</p>
> <p n="2">so the text finishes</p>
> <p n="3"> with yet another page <pb n="3"/> and another page start </p>
> </div>
> <div>
> <head>Second text</head>
> <pb n="4"/>
> <p n="1">here my new text on the next page etc etc</p>
> <pb n="5"/>
> <p n="2">here my new text on the next page etc etc</p>
> </div>
> </div>

> <head>Second text</head>
> <pb n="4"/>
> <p n="1">here

> <head>Second text<pb n="4"/></head>
