Call for Submissions*Marginalia*
/A new, interdisciplinary graduate journal of the Middle Ages/
/'Illumination'/: The theme for the third issue of Marginalia is
'Illumination'. In recent months, the 'Cambridge Illuminations'
exhibition has provoked much thought on illumination in textual and
manuscript studies. For the third issue of Marginalia, we invite
contributors to consider broader approaches to issues of 'illumination',
in the Middle Ages, and in scholarly approaches to this period. We
welcome submissions from graduates working in all areas of Medieval
studies, which might address illumination in terms of- sight and the visual
- spiritual or metaphorical revelation
- scientific discoveries of the Middle Ages
- issues of epistemology and knowledge
- overturning the stigma of the 'dark ages'We invite submissions in the form of long articles (approximately 5,000
words) and shorter /Notes and Queries/ style articles (approximately
1,000 words), which must conform to the MHRA style guide (available
online at www.mhra.org.uk <http://www.mhra.org.uk/>). Please see our
