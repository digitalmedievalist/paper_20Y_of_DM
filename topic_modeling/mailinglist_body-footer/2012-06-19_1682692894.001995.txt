Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableHi DavidThis is a really good question. I came into academia with an established back=
ground as an digital imaging scientist and as far as I can see at the moment,=
 there are no real standards for image digitation or reproduction in the acad=
emic world that can be used effectively by scholars. For example TEI says a l=
ot about how you reference your images but (unsurprisingly) doesn't attempt t=
o give any guidance on how you get them into an appropriate resolution or col=
our depth in the first place. JISC also give some guidance here but many of t=
heir project specifications often seem to favour 4800dpi in 24bit colour. Not=
 very helpful if (for example) you are scanning First World War black and whi=
te photographs which have a relatively low lines per inch resolution (search =
for lpi to dpi calculators online) or if you are using a scanner which has a =
maximum optical resolution of (say) 2400dpi and everything else is interpolat=
ed resolution. These things will of course differ from project to project whi=
ch is why it is so difficult to lay down accurate guidelines.I ran a workshop at Kalamazoo which dealt with some of these issues ('Digital=
 Imaging for Medievalists'). Interestingly enough I scanned and printed some =
conventional (pre-digital) black and white and colour photographs at various =
resolutions and colour depths and not one person out of the 30 people who cam=
e to the session correctly identified which ones were which out of each set. =
In my view, what we really need are some standards and accurate guidelines an=
d I am researching this area at the moment. For example, not many people real=
ise that some pre-digital transparencies are between 2,000 and 4,000 lines re=
solution (lpi) which puts many digital cameras in the shade.Moving to your question, I think the important thing to understand is that sc=
reen resolutions are still extremely low when compared with (say) printer res=
olutions. For example a typical laptop screen at 1024x768 is between 75dpi an=
d 100dpi depending on the physical screen size. Many modern mobile phone/smar=
t phone dpi tends to be around 150dpi. Of course these are all generalisation=
s and there are many web based calculators such as http://tiporama.com/tools/=
pixels_inches.html which can give you a better idea of resolution capability =
on a device by device basis. Compare that with an EPSON printer at 1440dpi ho=
rizontal resolution and you will understand and appreciate the comparison. So=
 it is important to understand that the image you display at any one time on =
the screen can be relatively low (for performance reasons), but the underlyin=
g source image (the original scan) needs to be high and lossless to allow the=
 best level of zoom as you move closer and closer into the page. As a palaeog=
rapher, I want to be able to see 'the big picture' (i.e. the whole page) at a=
ny one time but then I also want to be able to zoom into sections of the manu=
script and then down to the individual characters (without pixellation)  to d=
etermine if that character really is an "S" or an "A" (palaeographers will ge=
t the joke here). The problem with most lossy compressions is that the 'big p=
icture' is great but, as you zoom in, you start to see significant degradatio=
n of the image (a by-product of the way the compression is done) which gets i=
n the way of scholarly interpretation. For example take a high resolution TIF=
F image, compress it at various JPG levels and then print it full page on a h=
igh resolution printer. You will find that all the samples are virtually indi=
stinguishable from each other until you bring out a magnifying glass and then=
 all will become depressingly clear in terms of the drop in image quality/fid=
elity at the lowest file sizes.As other contributors have indicated, there are various solutions (e.g. http:=
//djvu.org/resources/whatisdjvu.php and Virtual Vellum) which can also help, =
but the resolution, compression and colour depth of the underlying image is s=
till key. As James implies, it is also important to select a software solutio=
n that has longevity and is not going to disappear or change once your resear=
ch project is completed. There are a number of Flash based viewers around but=
 (as James also implies), Adobe's track record at maintaining backward compat=
ibility (and even retaining technology) has not been that great in the past. =
Having said that, Adobe Flash has installations that run into at least the te=
ns of millions so it is unlikely to disappear overnight but we all know Apple=
's stance on Adobe Flash!So in closing, I think the most important thing to ensure, for any manuscript=
 project at least, is that the underlying image is at the highest resolution =
possible (lossless) and the capabilities to zoom into 'snapshots' of that ima=
ge are flexible in terms of the zoom factors allowed. However, the image 'sna=
pshot' that gets displayed at any one time on the screen can be relatively lo=
w for optimal performance but it still needs to be an accurate subset of the =
original image and as a result downscaling resolution from a lossy compressed=
 original is unlikely to work very well. As I recall, this downscaling is som=
ething that Virtual Vellum does well as does Photoshop of course but to ident=
ify one of the many tools and plug-in's which operate in a similar and approp=
riate way for your particular needs and custom website will of course need yo=
ur further research.Hope this helpsBest regardsTony Harris

Subject: [dm-l] best practice: photographc facsimile?Dear Digital Medievalist,For a couple of new Internet editions of medieval manuscripts I've procured h=
igh-resolution tiff images, which I'm publishing with a "magnifying glass" ov=
erlay. This is in a "responsive" context, so the components of the page, incl=
uding the images, resize to fit the window dimensions. There's a sample at:http://suprasliensis.obdurodon.org/pages/supr001r.htmlThe current images were prepared quickly for a demo, and are not of consisten=
t size or resolution. I would now like to go back to get this part of the sit=
e up to production quality, and I would be grateful for advice about how to m=
anage the images, an area where I don't have much (=3D any) knowledge of best=
 practice. I'd like small image files that load quickly, and I think I don't =
mind slightly lossy compression if that would reduce the file size substantia=
lly--but if that's a mistake, I'd be grateful for a warning. I think there ar=
e two questions:1. What's an appropriate file format and resolution (size, dpi, color depth, =
etc.) for the base image, the one that is displayed in full to the right of t=
he transcription, and that resizes as the user resizes the window? Currently =
the image files are in jpg format and vary in size from about 2M down to 250k=
. I can regenerate them all at a common size, resolution, color depth, etc. f=
rom the original tiffs, but I don't know whether there is any sense of best p=
ractice concerning what that size should be. If I go the lossy route, what's =
a reasonable value?2. What's an appropriate degree of magnification for the magnifying-glass ins=
et view? Currently the magnifying glass inset always shows the image at 200% =
of the actual file size (not the size of the page as displayed without magnif=
ication in the browser window!). You can see the difference by comparing, say=
, folio 30v (about 2MB) to 284r (about 270k), where the magnification is much=
 greater in the former than the latter. I can set the level of magnification =
anywhere I'd like, but is there any agreement about best practice here?By way of orientation in the question: the purpose of the full image is to al=
low the user to see the image conveniently alongside the transcription, verif=
ying any moments where our editorial judgment might appear surprising or ques=
tionable. The point of the magnified inset is to let the user examine details=
 that may not be visible at lesser magnification, such as erasures, correctio=
ns, etc. My casual impression is that 30v looks pretty good and loads reasona=
bly quickly (although quicker would be better), but I don't place great confi=
dence in my own casual impressions.Thanks,David
