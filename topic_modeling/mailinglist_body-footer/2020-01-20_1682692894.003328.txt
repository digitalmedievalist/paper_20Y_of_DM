We are happy to announce the eleventh issue of the review journal RIDE,
which has been published since 2014 by the Institute for Documentology and
Scholarly Editing. This issue is the first in the RIDE-series dedicated to
“Tools and Environments for Digital Scholarly Editing”. Initiators and
guest editors of the issue are Anna-Maria Sichani and Elena Spadini.The idea behind this new thematic focus in the RIDE-series is that software
is part of the scholarly ecosystem and as such should be valued and
reviewed. Furthermore, we hope that reviews of tools and environments can
be useful for those involved in the creation of scholarly editions, to find
the right software for each specific need.  All reviews reflect a detailed
catalogue of evaluation criteria (
https://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-tools-version-1/)
and are accompanied by a summarizing factsheet (see "Meta" rubric of each
article).RIDE 11 issue includes five reviews in English (4) and French (1) that
critically assess Tools and Environments for Digital Scholarly Editing. For
your convenience, this is the table of contents:   -   Andrew Dunning: Reledmac. Typesetting technology-independent critical
