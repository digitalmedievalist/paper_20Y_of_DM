6th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the
Digital AgeNovember 21-23, 2013 Thinking Outside the CodexIn partnership with the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of
Philadelphia, the Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies at the
University of Pennsylvania is pleased to announce the 6th Annual Lawrence J.
Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age. This year's
symposium will encourage participants to "think outside the codex" and turn
the tables on traditional approaches to manuscript study. We will explore
such topics as how format shapes and limits interpretation, use, and
production of manuscripts and how technologies have changed and challenged
traditional methods of scholarship. We are especially considering instances
of and responses to failure in the history of manuscript production and
scholarship. In doing so, we hope to provoke new questions and forge new
approaches to the study of the pre-modern book.To kick off the event, a reception and the keynote address will be held
Thursday evening, November 21, at the Free Library of Philadelphia. This
year's keynote speaker will be Peter Stallybrass, Walter H. and Leonore C.
Annenberg Professor in the Humanities, Professor of English and of
Comparative Literature and Literary Theory, and Director of the History of
the Material Text Seminar at the University of Pennsylvania.  The symposium
begins Friday morning at the newly renovated Special Collections Center of
the University Pennsylvania Libraries. Speakers include:*	Benjamin Albritton, Stanford University
*	Benjamin Fleming, University of Pennsylvania
*	Martin Foys, King's College, London
*	Evyn Kropf, University of Michigan

*	Kathryn Rudy, University of St. Andrews
*	Robert Sanderson, Los Alamos National Laboratory
*	Timothy Stinson, North Carolina State University
*	Marie Turner, University of Pennsylvania
