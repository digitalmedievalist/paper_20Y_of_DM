TEI as obsolete. How can you call an initiative that changes all the time
according to scholars' needs and contributions obsolete? As we know TEI is
an effort to produce guidelines, it isn't a static set of rules to follow.
Hopefully it shouldn't have time to become obsolete by aiming to evolve all
the time. It could be claimed that this is theory, just ideological
statements that are in fact not applied in practice.
However, and this is my second point, to allow TEI to grow and face new
challenges humanists' contribution is needed. I don't need to stress this
point since others in this list did it already better than I could.The second part of Dan's question is more complex and, I think, involves the
broader issue of Humanities Computing as a discipline that aims to
incorporate either expertise proper to medieval studies - to stay in the
field - and expertise proper to technical skills.
Even when all the benefits of XML encoding are full understood and valued,
for a medievalist it can be rather demanding and frustrating to acquire
practical knowledge of mark-up or of any other "technicality" from scratch.
It is rare to find the combination of technical skills and humanities
expertise in a single scholar. 
Indeed, digital humanities disciplines require a collaborative work where
different expertise meet and discuss, reaching fruitful compromises. This
doesn't mean at all that computer engineers to talk to are the solutions,
but rather than community based resources (as TEI and Digital Medievalist
are together with Humanist and new born soon...) and humanities computing
specialists that filter and produce a set of best practices is a step
towards the most fruitful direction.Who is a humanist computing specialist? Someone who has already adapted the
available technology (TEI-XML/database based etc.) or, in some cases, who
has created technological solutions for other humanities computing projects
with similar problematic needs.When tools become more complex - and we want them to become more complex to
fulfill our demands -, the research process becomes more complex as well,
enlarging itself, facilitating shared practices, more democratic and
therefore more critical.Arianna Ciula-----Original Message-----

Subject: [dm-l] Are markup languages obsolete?Hi all,
	As some of you know, I write a column on electonica medievalia for
Heroic Age, a superb online journal in its 8th year.
	My next column is due soon, and while I was originally planning to
write on TEI P5, something that came up on Medtext has sat in my head
for the last several weeks: it was an email from Judith Bolton Halloway
(I think it was) that described markup languages and protocols like the
TEI as obsolete in the face of high quality manuscript facsimiles (I'm
paraphrasing and so might not have it exactly right).
	What I'm wondering is not so much whether markup languages are
obsolete
(that's demonstrably not true in a technical sense), but whether there
is an easy argument that they are worth it for a low tech humanities
oriented person to learn. I'm thinking here of the issues raised in
Peter Robinson's article in the premier issue of DM, various talks I've
given or heard at conferences.
	So here's a question: when is it worth it to devote time to learning
a
complex language like TEI--or any other standards based structural
language or computer skill (and when is it not)? What should one expect
to get out of going to the trouble of learning them? And what do you
lose by (or simply what is the cost of) doing so?
	I suppose this might be a question for Humanist, but I thought I'd
try
it out here given the medieval focus of HA. I'm not (necessarily)
looking for answers to my topic for my column, but I'm interested in
mulling the question over with others before I set cursor to screen.
