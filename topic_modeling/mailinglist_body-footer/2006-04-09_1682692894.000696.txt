the same thing.  Their PAD (Preservation, Archival, Dissemination)
project"seeks to identify threatened and endangered electronic literature and
to maintain accessibility, encourage stability, and ensure
availability of electronic works for readers, institutions, and
scholars. PAD seems to supplement and contribute to the efforts of
other projects aimed and preserving digital media, and other projects
dealing with textual materials, by focusing on the particular problems
of electronic literature, which can combine the complexity of a
multimedia compter program with the demands of a literary text."Maybe it would be worth talking to them?..http://eliterature.org/programs/pad/-Vika--
