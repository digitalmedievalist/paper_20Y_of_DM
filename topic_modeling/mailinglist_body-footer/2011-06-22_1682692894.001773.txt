HdtDep: a treebank and search engine for Greek word order study
ALL WELCOMEHdtDep is a treebank and search engine based on the first book of 
Herodotus’ Histories. The structure of the sentences has been parsed 
applying a modified version of Mel’cuk’s dependency syntax, and has been 
encoded in an XML database. The search engine allows searching for 
precise dependency patterns involving specific grammatical categories or 
lexemes in exact sequences, and can easily be programmed through a user 
friendly graphic interface. This tool is especially designed for 
classicists and linguists investigating Greek word order—hence the 
choice of Herodotus’ prose as linguistic material—but can also be useful 
for teachers and language learners.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk,
