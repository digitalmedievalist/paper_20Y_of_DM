politically correct services) in the meta line, you might help yourself
rank high in google ;)To return to the original bibliography question, I wonder if there might
not be something that could be generalised from Roy Liuzza's work on the
Old English Newsletter bibliography
<http://www.oenewsletter.org/OEN/login.php>. It is coded using PHP and
MySQL, I believe, and takes into account bibliographic standards. He is
writing a piece for us on the bibliography, though its publication has
been pushed back an issue due to Katrina.If that system could be made standard, it might be very attractive to
many people. ProCite, though a very good program for its day, has lousy
customer support and has been more or less abandoned by Thompson, as far
as I can tell.On Tue, 2005-10-04 at 16:00 -0700, Al Magary wrote:
