Medieval Studies programme here in Zagreb, Croatia. I deal mainly with
texts, but this year I have a student who is more interested in archeology
(medieval, of course). Could you suggest some good archeology mailing
lists / Google groups vel sim. --- medieval, or, I guess, "general
practice" --- where this person could learn, and follow, how and what is
discussed?Yours,Neven Jovanovic
