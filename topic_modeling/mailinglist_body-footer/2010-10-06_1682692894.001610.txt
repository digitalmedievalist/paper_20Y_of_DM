Locations provide a way for Kindles, but the Locations will vary
depending on the font size in use.  So it will provide the individual
with a way to reference something for themselves, but not for anyone
else (arbitrary bookmarks that might come close to canonical).This is one of the largest problems with ebooks and ereaders for
scholarly work.  Some body will need to define the standards for
footnoting, and doing cross-references.  To date, I have no heard of
any such standards in the works. Perhaps others have.Patrick Gardella
