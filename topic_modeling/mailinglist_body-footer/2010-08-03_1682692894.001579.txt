n that I can help answer!=20I am the digital initiatives coordinator at a special collections library, an=
d the field and theory of digital preservation is changing rapidly.Terms you'll want to define and liberally use in your article include, but ar=
e not limited to:Bitstream copying: this is what you do when you back up your files onto an ex=
ternal hard drive; bitstream copying is the most basic level of digital prese=
rvation, and although it is necessary, it misses a lot about information itse=
lf.=20-Digital sustainability: incorporates a number of actions intended to preserv=
e digital artifacts to be accessible to an nth year.  The best rule of thumb =
I've heard someone use is 10 years: "If I create this JPEG now, will its form=
at be sustainable and readable ten years from now?" =20-Digital encapsulation: this refers to two things, the digital artifact itsel=
f and its descriptive information. For instance, what good is a JPEG image of=
 a cuneiform tablet if there is no descriptive information--metadata--attache=
d to it?  Encapsulation is the idea that information must always accompany th=
e item.  (In addition encapsulation includes preservation metadata, which tra=
cks file integrity information (like checksums).=20-Migration: implies copying information from one technology to another; this =
copying includes both the digital artifact itself and any metadata attached t=
o it. =20
-Emulation: If you have that doc file, and you need a system that reads it, y=
ou eventually will find an emulator to be useful. Emulation provides a simula=
crum of a digital object's original software environment, which not only allo=
ws access to the file, but it also preserves the original digital experience.=
 Emulation and migration are often discussed as oppositional ideas, but they =
both play an important role in digital preservation.-Standards and normalization, consistency: Standards are key to good digital =
preservation strategy.  Normalization is the dedicated adherence to those sta=
ndards.  Consistency is always key to digital repositories and their preserva=
tion.
This will get you started. I'd recommend taking a listen to the new(ish) Libr=
ary of Congress digital preservation podcast series: http://www.loc.gov/podca=
sts/digitalpreservation/index.html=20Best of luck.=20
Best,
Ana Krahmer    Dear Digital Medievalists and TEI members,
>>
>>
>>     I have a question about preservation of digital content
>>     especially medieval manuscripts. I am writing a small article on
>>     the topic and I have consulted a lot sources (papers, handbooks)
>>     but most of them do not say anything about the =E2=80=9Clife span=E2=
=80=9D of the
>>     data in specific formats. To clarify this =E2=80=93 a .doc file crated=
 in
>>     1995. Will be most likely unreadable  in 2010.  What about other
>>     formats? Has anyone done some research on =E2=80=9Clife span=E2=80=9D =
of a
>>     specific version of digital formats and when it becomes clear
>>     that the new version and the old one are not compatible anymore?
>>     And here I am talking about pdf, rtf, doc (and all office files),
>>     djvu, tiff, jpg , mpg etc. (texts and images especially)
>>
>>     In my work I am also making a small remark on XML as a data
>>     container since it is, in my opinion, the best way to go and the
>>     standard will surely be around for years. But what kind of steps
>>     do you make to ensure the preservation of documents that have
>>     been encoded in xml
>>
>>     I would also like to hear if there are opposing views on xml.
>>
>>     I also have the same question about the media. I found some
>>     research about the longevity of CDs and DVDs but I am also
>>     interested in other media like older hard disks, zip drives and
>>     magnetic media.
>>
>>     I am sorry to bother you with this, but I can use any help I can get
>>
>>     Thank you in advance
