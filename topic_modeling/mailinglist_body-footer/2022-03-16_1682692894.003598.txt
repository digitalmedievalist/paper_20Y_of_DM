lls>Natasha Hodgson will discuss some of the issues relating to the digitization =
of manuscript rolls, focusing on a fifteenth-century genealogical roll produc=
ed during the Wars of the Roses currently held at the University of Canterbur=
y in Christchurch in New Zealand, the Canterbury Roll.  A collaboration betwe=
en scholars at UC and Nottingham Trent University in the UK, the current proj=
ect provides a test case for exploring the challenges of representing these l=
arge, complex, and delicate material objects in digital form. As the project =
moves into a new phase, we are exploring new ways to incorporate, compare and=
 contrast more rolls, adding layers of historical interpretation, network ana=
lysis, and heritage science data. Dr. Hodgson will discuss how the team will =
combine three research streams - History, Heritage Science, and Digital Human=
ities - to better understand the impetus and processes behind the constructio=
n of genealogical rolls as well as the establishment of their wider socio-cul=
tural and political importance.--===============0988062659110650666==
