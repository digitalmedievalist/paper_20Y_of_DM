standard in XHTML, which was a change from previous practice.Looking at the 2.0 standard, I think they are probably doing a bad job 
of explaining it: they should be emphasising that the marks are to be 
supplied by a stylesheet; given that the actual marks used to indicate 
quotations are really accidental features of typography rather than 
structural categories, they should not be encouraging people to put them 
into a document as CDATA!-danBinkley, Peter wrote:
