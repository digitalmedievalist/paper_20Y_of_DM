for the cross posting to those who have received it multiple times. 
While this is a reasonable change in focus, I'll miss the old CHum, I 
must say. There were interesting markup articles every couple of issues 
(including, for example, one on metre last year and one in the latest 
issue on an "intertextual" tag and using multiple dtds).

LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND EVALUATION
***************************************************Editors-in-chief:
      Nancy Ide, Department of Computer Science, Vassar College, USA
      Nicoletta Calzolari, Isitiuto di Linguistica Computazionale, CNR, 
ItalyPublished by Springer (formerly Kluwer Academic Publishers and Springer 
Verlag)We are pleased to announce that as of Volume 39 for 2005, Computers and the
Humanities will be changing its name to Language Resources and Evaluation.Language Resources and Evaluation is the first publication devoted to the
creation, annotation, and exploitation of language resources for use in
language processing applications, corpus linguistics and linguistic studies
generally, as well as evaluation of language processing methods and
results. These areas have seen a dramatic increase in activity over the
past decade, as evidenced by the growing attendance at the four Language
Resources and Evaluation Conferences (LREC) held since 1998.Language resources include language data and descriptions in machine
readable form used to assist and augment language processing applications
and linguistic studies, such as written or spoken corpora and lexica,
multimodal resources, grammars, terminology or domain specific databases
and dictionaries, ontologies, multimedia databases, etc., as well as basic
software tools for their acquisition, preparation, annotation, management,
customization, and use. Evaluation of language resources concerns assessing
the state-of-the-art for a given technology, comparing different approaches
to a given problem, assessing the availability of resources and
technologies for a given application, benchmarking, and assessing system
usability and user satisfaction.Articles are solicited on the following topics:Design, construction and use of Language Resources (LRs):
·      Guidelines, standards, specifications, models, and best practices
for LRs,
·      Methods, tools and procedures for the acquisition, creation,
annotation, management, access, distribution and use of LRs
·      Methods for the extraction and acquisition of knowledge (e.g. terms,
lexical information, language modeling data) from LRs
·      Organizational and legal issues in the construction, distribution,
access and use of LRs
·      Availability and use of generic vs. task/domain specific LRs
·      Monolingual and multilingual LRs
·      Multimedia and multimodal LRs and integration of various media and
modalities (speech, vision, language)
·      Documentation and archiving of languages, including minority and
endangered languages,
·      Ontologies and knowledge representation
·      Tools and methodologies for terminology and ontology building, term
extraction, and creation of specialized dictionaries
·      LRs for linguistic research in human-machine communication
·      Exploitation of LRs in different types of applications (information
extraction, information retrieval, speech dictation, translation,
summarization, web services, semantic web, etc.),
·      Exploitation of LRs in different types of interfaces (dialog
systems, natural language and multimodal/multisensorial interactions, etc.)
·      Metadata descriptions of LRs
·      Open architectures for LRsHuman Language Technologies Evaluation:
·      Evaluation, validation, quality assurance of LRs
·      Evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures
·      Benchmarking of systems, resources for benchmarking and evaluation,
blackbox, glassbox and diagnostic evaluation of systems
·      Evaluation in written language processing (document production and
management, text retrieval, terminology extraction, message understanding,
text alignment, machine translation, morphosyntactic tagging, parsing,
semantic tagging, word sense disambiguation, text understanding,
summarization, question answering, etc.)
·      Evaluation in spoken language processing (speech recognition and
understanding, voice dictation, oral dialog, speech synthesis, speech
coding, speaker and language recognition, spoken translation, etc.)
·      Evaluation of multimedia document retrieval and search systems
(including detection, indexing, filtering, alert, question answering, etc)
·      Evaluation of multimodal systems
·      Moving from evaluation to standardizationLanguage Resources and Evaluation is the official journal of the European
Language Resources Association (ELRA), sponsor of the bi-annual LREC
conference. The first number of LRE in 2005 will be a special issue
dedicated to the memory of Antonio Zampolli.For information about this new title, aims and scope, manuscript
