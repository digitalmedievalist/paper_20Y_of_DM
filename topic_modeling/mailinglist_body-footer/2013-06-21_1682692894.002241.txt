I think you are hitting upon a very sore point in the DH/editorial communitie=
s.  We have had editorial projects launched all over the place, with great en=
thusiasm and often, substantial funding.  Many now face exactly the problem y=
ou outline: what happens after the PI/institution move on?
So, here are three things you can do which will help immensely:
1.  Explicitly declare all your materials as Creative Commons Share-alike att=
ribution: that is, **without** the 'non-commercial' use restrictions so often=
 (and wrongly) imposed by many projects. =20
2.  Place the data, so licensed, on any open server.  The Oxford Text Archive=
 is, after so many years, still the best place I know to put your data.
That alone should be enough to make your data live forever.  And wonderfully,=
 these two options will cost you not a cent, and maybe just  a few hours of y=
our time to deal with the OTA deposit pack.Optionally, you could also:
3.  Place the data within an institutional repositiory.  This gives you the o=
ption to use the IR tools to construct an interface, and provide basic search=
 and other tools.  In my mind, this option has been scandalously underused by=
 DH projects, for reasons which might be the subject of another post.  But th=
is does provide the opportunity for you to present your project in a way that=
 will connect its metadata with the whole world of OASIS etc tools, and offer=
 a sustainable interface.  The University of Birmingham Research Archive give=
s some idea of how this might work: see (for example) the entries for the Min=
gana collection (eg http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/84/) and Codex Sinaiticus ( htt=
p://epapers.bham.ac.uk/1690/).There is another answer:
1.  Keep the 'non-commercial' licence restriction on your data.  You can ther=
eby claim that you are allowing all your fellow academics to use it freely, w=
hile (if you choose) not actually making it freely available outside your int=
erface.
2.  Create an elaborate and very attractive interface to your data
3.  Persuade your university, or someone, to set up a DH centre, with a minim=
um staff of a director and programmer, space and dedicated equipment (say, 10=
0K a year if you can swing this with part-time staff etc).  This DH centre wi=
ll then have the task of maintaining your data (which of course, only the cen=
tre has), interface and project.  This centre can then deal with all the issu=
es you raise in your post.
4.  Persuade your university, or someone, to support data, interface and proj=
ect, in perpetuityWell, good luck with that!Peter
