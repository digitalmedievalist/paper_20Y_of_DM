epublication of things that work well in online format: databases,
articles, etc. Monographs less so, of course.The real test in my view will be how the refereeing goes. At DM we are
experimenting with this: we see our journal as a way of brokering
prestige: we get articles, publish them for free, and in exchange for
getting your labour--i.e. the article--we try to get the best possible
referees. We name accepting referees on the front cover of an article
both as a reward for the referees--it DOES take time, after all--and as
a way of passing that prestige off. As an author, your work has been
certified by knowledgeable peers.There are obviously different views on this, but it has always seemed to
me that since academics do the writing and the certification, we could
probably keep the means of production in our own hands.-danOn Thu, 2006-16-11 at 11:34 -0500, Patricia Kosco Cossard wrote:
