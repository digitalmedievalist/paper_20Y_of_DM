archival collections, which include printed material such as maps, and=20
objects such as seals (only one sword that I can think of). While this=20
does include all the pieces in a collection in a single catalogue, it=20
can lead to the stretching of elements to accommodate the data structure=20
required by different material types.In an ideal world I would use MARC21 for maps (a new revision of AACR2=20

compliant museum documentation system for objects, but tying all of=20
these back together to produce a single catalogue of the collection=20
could prove a challenge (export all the data into XML; develop Z39.50=20
