is trying out a new more-conference-like and less business-meeting-like
approach. As a member of the planning committee for the conference,
moreover, I can assure you that we are looking for a broad range of
approaches to markup and/or the TEI--and not just "boy this koolaid sure
is tasty."-dan----------------------------The TEI Members' Meeting
    1-3 November 2007
      University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA*TEI(a)20*: 20 Years of Supporting the Digital HumanitiesThe Organizing Committee of this anniversary TEI Members' Meeting 
invites individual paper proposals, panel sessions, and poster/tool 
demonstrations on the theme, broadly conceived, 'The TEI(a)20: 20 Years
of 
Supporting the Digital Humanities'. Topics might include but are not 
restricted to    * Building and using tools for TEI-based text encoding
    * Teaching TEI: Challenges and Opportunities
    * TEI as a theory of text
    * TEI: the next 20 years
    * New career opportunities for those using the TEI
    * Lacunae and omissions: new directions for the TEIPaper presenters will be allocated 30 minutes to speak, 25 minutes for 
delivery, and five minutes for questions.Alternatively, group sessions can be organized for 1.5 hours each and 
may be of varied formats, including:    * A working papers session (pre-circulated papers)
    * A round-table discussion
    * Software demonstrationsOf the formats described above, a working paper session might be more 
appropriate for a smaller group, all of whom have all read the 
pre-circulated papers in advance. This type of format may span more
than 
one session and will be held concurrently with the general session.
