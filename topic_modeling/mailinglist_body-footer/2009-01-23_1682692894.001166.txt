*Stanford** University** Libraries & Academic Information Resources*The Digital Manuscript Specialist will serve as a key team member on a 
collaborative project funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The 
project supports the development and conduct of a workshop that will 
examine specific instances of research and teaching based on selected 
medieval manuscript collections with a view to defining certain 
parameters of future work. Instances of such research and teaching 
involve several humanistic disciplines and auxiliary sciences like 
paleography and codicology, and focus special attention to approaches 
that rely heavily or essentially on the availability and use of data in 
digital form. The project is especially interested in the development or 
exercise of tools and architectures that (1) facilitate access to 
materials in multiple digital collections, (2) link sites and 
collections via common or cross-walked metadata schema, (3) link text 
and image at the feature or information content level, (4) link primary 
materials and secondary scholarship, and (5) help establish 
specifications for new and future projects. The Digital Manuscript 
Specialist will work as a part of a small team charged to analyze the 
overlapping and intersecting requirements of the use-cases in the 
context of digitized manuscript collections generally.Required Knowledge· A postgraduate degree in a relevant subfield of medieval or early 
modern studies, with significant experience and background (formal or 
informal) in descriptive metadata encoding of digital manuscripts.
· Core technical skills: experience with XML, and specifically 
descriptive metadata schemas such as TEI, EAD, METS, and MODS.
· The ability to blend domain expertise in medieval manuscript studies 
with technical expertise in prevailing standards and best practices in 
the development of digital manuscript tools and repositories.
· Excellent organizational and communication skills, and proven ability 
to meet deadlines.
· Demonstrated ability to work collaboratively and successfully in a 
team-based environment.
· Minimum related experience required: 1 year; 2-3 years desiredDistribution of Effort:· Consult with the six PI’s allied with the project to develop and 
execute use-cases that demonstrate the potential of digital manuscript 
projects and that suggest future directions for interoperability that 
support teaching and research. (20%)
· Consult with the six PI’s and Stanford Libraries’ technical staff on 
various projects to develop XML schema for describing digitized medieval 
artifacts and related secondary works in ways that support teaching and 
research goals, and comply with community best practices and standards. 
(30%)
· Analyze tools, metadata approaches and technical architectures for 
selected digital manuscript projects and repositories. (30%)
· Produce an integrated report on the outcomes of the use cases and the 
framework for interoperability they suggest. (20%)This is a grant-funded position with a maximum length of 12 months. The 
position is available beginning April 1, 2009, but the exact start date 
is negotiable. No matter the start date, however, the job ends on March 
31, 2010.Please apply by searching for “33546” in the Keyword Search field (with 
nothing else highlighted) at: http://jobs.stanford.edu/find_a_job.html, 
and clicking on the Apply button.Applications submitted as soon as possible will be in the best position 
to receive full consideration.
