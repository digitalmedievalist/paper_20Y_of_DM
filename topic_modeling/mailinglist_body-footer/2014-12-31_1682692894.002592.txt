various version control systems. Mercurial and Git are similar, but I
prefer Git because I use it daily and the people I collaborate with use it.
I've seen companies use both systems, and Google has built their own
internal version control system in addition to using Git for open source
projects. The point I was trying to make was to use a version control
system that works well for code. I don't think it matters which one, but as
long as there is one that does a good job, that's what matters. Whether you
use Git or Mercurial shouldn't matter. They are both better than Dropbox or
Google Drive for code.However, I think that Dan was just asking about using something that is
easy to use with a high turnover of students. I'd suggest using Google
Drive because you can modify and store all of your documents online and
will be able to do everything in the browser.On Wed, Dec 31, 2014 at 9:43 AM, Janusz S. Bien <jsbien(a)mimuw.edu.pl> wrote:> Quote/Cytat - "Sara L. Uckelman" <s.l.uckelman(a)durham.ac.uk> (Tue 30 Dec
