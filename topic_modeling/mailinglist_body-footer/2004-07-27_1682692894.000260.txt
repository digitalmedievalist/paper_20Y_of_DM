I would like to thank all participants (we are a couple short of 200) for
the great generosity they have shown in sharing software, techniques, and
examples, on this list in its short life. This is exactly what I'd been
hoping would happen, and I am pleased to see the very generous
participation we have had.We are testing the website right now and with some luck will have it up in
the next couple of weeks. This will allow us to build a FAQ and begin to
formalise our collective experience.If you have tools, software, or techniques that you are willing to
describe formally, may I suggest the forthcoming Digital Medievalist
Journal? This might be an excellent forum for a brief description of your
work.Cheers,
-dan
