Hello All,May I give a shoutout to Lisa Fagin Davis and recommend her webinar, =E2=80=
=98Fragments and Fragmentology in the 21st Century'? I was late to th=
e party and so missed registration but caught it over on YouTube https://yout=
u.be/JQ-XGFZolF8. It's a real winner: informative, engaging, generous=
 with knowledge. The Q&A, curated by Ben Albritton, added another exciting di=
mension. Really, it's scintillating and Elaine Treharne, Ben Albritto=
n and the team at Stanford Text Technologies deserve a loud <Gaudete>.Thanks,
