TEI doesn't go far enough to the TEI-L list.  They are always 
happy to see where they can improve.  Digital Scriptorium's 
extensions are quite good.  There is a good discussion of 
some of these issues at: http://www.hum.ku.dk/ami/handbook/For those who haven't seen the manuscript description 
taskforce of TEI its activities are listed at:
http://www.tei-c.org.uk/Activities/MS/
but I realise that concentrates on description rather 
that palaeographical analysis.  These are all draft documents, 
however, and still have many errors that they will be correcting.  -James---
