I have a question I'd like to run before the list:This morning I threw out the idea of setting up a humanities computing
digest: that is to say a list that digests the traffic on important Hum
Comp lists once a day but otherwise carries no traffic.Talking about it later with somebody, they suggested to me that 1 digest
message each day would not be an unreasonable burden on a list like DM.Is this something people would appreciate? What I'm thinking is a list
that simply subscribes to digital classicist, humanist, the junicode
list, and I don't know what else, and is configured to send out a single
digest message per day. If we subscribed dm-l to it as well, we would
all receive this one message every day. If the goal was to add a digesting feature to dm-l, I would set the dm-l
subscription to "reject postings" so that our postings would not be
duplicated in the digest, and set the other lists to "nomail" so they
wouldn't receive it. Since many of us are subscribers to several of
these lists, there would be some duplication in individual mail boxes.The other option is to set up a separate digest and leave it at that.Suggestions/ideas?-d
