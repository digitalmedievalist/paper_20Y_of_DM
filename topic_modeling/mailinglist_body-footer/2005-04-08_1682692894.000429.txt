fragments as individual page files - so only having to do the process=20
once?  I agree with you whole-heartedly that XSLT is problematic for=20
choosing to display from one arbitrary point to another arbitrary point=20
in the XML, but your points aren't arbitrary.  Page breaks will be the=20
same each time, so I don't see the need to do this dynamically.  Store=20
your full versions of Hengwrt, and also store files created for each=20
page, searching the former, but displaying the latter.  Just because we=20
*can* dynamically pull out a single page from the whole of a large XML=20
file doesn't mean we *have* to.> I don't have a prejudice against XSLT, which seems a fine tool for doing

tool and it is wonderful that it has been made open source.--=20
