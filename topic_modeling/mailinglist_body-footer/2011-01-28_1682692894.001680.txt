Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Marjorie,I totally agree with this approach. Although I have as yet very little practi=
cal teaching experience in this area, I am thinking about developing a module=
 on using IT for humanities research for doctoral students. The approach I wa=
s planning to take is to teach them to program in Perl to process plain texts=
 and TEI encoded documents (using the XML:Twig library). Instead of teaching =
Perl from scratch I would give them working little programs which they can th=
en modify to suit their needs (a recipe book approach). I would also provide =
them with some basic XSLT and CSS, just enough to visualise the (original and=
 processed) data in a browser. I think that a procedural language like Perl i=
s easier to grasp than XSLT and to learn. Your suggestion of using packaged t=
ools is certainly something I will now consider too.It may well be that I am expecting too much from humanities reseachers, in te=
rms of teaching them to program. I'd be interested to hear of people who've d=
one something similar.Best,Godfried

Subject: [dm-l] Teaching the TEI: your practice?Dear Digital Medievalists,I guess I can safely assume that several people here have an experience=20
teaching the TEI, specifically to an audience of medievalists or=20
historians. After teaching some workshops, I feel more and more that it=20
is highly efficient to teach the TEI not alone, isolated, as a means to=20
encode documents in a smart way, but putting the TEI XML at the center=20
of the other technologies that make its interest immediately evident to=20
the students.
For instance, I have experienced that providing the students, when=20
they're finished with their task of encoding a critical edition, with=20
the Version Machine on the one hand and another set of XSLT producing a=20
classic, print-like view of their document greatly helps them=20
understanding not only what encoding is for, but also what they have=20
been doing so far.  I am even pondering whether or not including the use=20
of eXist-db in a forthcoming course (which might be pushing it a bit=20
far, I admit).
Of course, since XSLT or XQuery are not really easy to grasp in a short=20
period for people without any technical background, and it is not really=20
evident to introduce them to the subtleties of those technologies.=20
Still, it's probably good if the students get some idea of how=20
technologies work together, instead of putting all their trust into the=20
magic IT people will work on their smartly encoded TEI documents to "put=20
them on the web" :)I would be interested in a feedback of your practice: do you, when you=20
teach the TEI, feel the need / manage to integrate notions about other=20
tools and technologies of the XML family? And if so, how do you do that=20
(proper introduction to XSLT? use of packaged tools like the v-machine?=20
etc.).Just curious :)Marjorie--=20
