'A Virtual Research Environment for the Study of Documents and 
Manuscripts'
The scholar interpreting an ancient documentary text has a broad range 
of relevant electronic tools available; but the interaction is largely 
in one direction and the experience is fragmented by the dispersal of 
the electronic resources. Decipherment and transcription are scholarly 
activities that naturally benefit from shared visualisation and 
multiple perspectives, but the potential of ICT to mediate 
collaborative investigation has yet to be fully exploited. A VRE for 
the Study of Documents and Manuscripts is a two-year JISC funded 
project designed to explore these challenges through the construction 
of an integrated collaborative environment for the study of ancient 
documentary artefacts.----------------------
