theory on markup, and the TEI fundamentals):- teach some XSLT and have students experiment with it at once: this is
really useful to put to test some of the key concepts I explained before
(form-content separation, importance of selecting carefully *what* to
markup, what Torsten wrote about visualizing the intended result in
adnvance, etc.);
- have them use IMT to learn about with <facsimile> and friends;
- have them prepare a little encoding project to be discussed during the
final exam: they choose the text, explain to me their markup strategy,
then do everything on their own, including creating a custom schema
(using Roma) and XSLT style sheets to produce an HTML version ... this
is incredibly useful to expose lingering misconceptions and to really
learn what is like to work on a 'real' markup project.So far I'm quite satisfied with this sequence, will look into the
versioning machine too :) unfortunately I doubt I'd have the time to
explain XML DBs (that would be needed as well, of course).Ciao	Roberto-- Roberto Rosselli Del Turco      roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
