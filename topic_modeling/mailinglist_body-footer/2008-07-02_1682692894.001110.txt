Computational Approaches to Human and Animal Movement in the
Archaeological Record**ALL WELCOME**The inferential leap between the static archaeological record and our
explanation of dynamic past behaviours is always a challenging one, but
computational and quantitative techniques can be of great assistance. In
particular, they can provide useful insight on patterns of human and
animal movement, by better characterising existing archaeological
evidence, suggesting simple models of mobile decision-making or
proposing expected patterns of movement against which the observed
record can be compared.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk or
