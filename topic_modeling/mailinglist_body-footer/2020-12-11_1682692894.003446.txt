Dear colleagues,The Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities (VeDPH) gladly
announces the publication of its inaugural volume 2020 of magaz=C3=A9n,
International Journal for Digital and Public Humanities.The interdisciplinary journal is undergoing double-blind peer-review and
will be published twice per year in open access by Edizioni Ca' Fosca=
ri.It aims at stimulating an interdisciplinary discourse on methods and
practices serving a collaborative development of durable, reusable,
shared resources for research and learning in the field of digital and
public humanities. Volume 2020 features ten articles by international
scholars divided in two issues and devoted to the topic of =E2=80=9CFusions=
=E2=80=9D,
thus analysing the intertwining landscape emerging from the recent
development of digital and public humanities.As a matter of fact, in the last two decades much effort was placed in
defining separate disciplinary fields, in order to canonise and validate
the use of digital methodologies or public approaches in the specific
subsets of the humanities.However, evidence suggests that digital and public challenges facing
individual disciplines are actually common to the entire field of the
humanities, thus favouring a cross-disciplinary approach rather than
thematic isolation.Issue 1 can already be accessed online at
https://edizionicafoscari.unive.it/it/edizioni4/riviste/magazen/2020/1/,
while issue 2 will soon be made available on the same platform. Please
find the table of contents below.Table of contents:2020.1 > magaz=C3=A9n
