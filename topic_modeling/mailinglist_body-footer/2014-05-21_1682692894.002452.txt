wrote:=E2=80=94Quick
comment re the journal: I'd very much hope that wherever the journal
migrates to (and Revues.org or similar would seem useful) the old,
transparent, human-readable, "cool" URLs remain live permanently, even if
as rewrites/redirects. I've cited many of those urls in dozens of places,
including in print (!).=E2=80=94Seconded. This would be tres useful for many of us.Agreement on all points, and thanks to the hard-working few who have put so
much into keeping the old site up this long.Out of curiosity, if we shut the wiki down, will the community still have
the opportunity to contribute to the blog in a similar fashion? I realize
that the original intent of the wiki was to have a resource created by the
community. Since the current one was predominantly populated by the board
members, it hasn't met with expectations. Does the Board envision that the
proposed blog would encourage more input?Best,~Sarah Pf.
