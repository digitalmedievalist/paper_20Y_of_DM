10.6). In "1345 : prologue d'un compte" scrolling back and forth from
the image to the transcription box is a little bit difficult but
that's no big deal.Best wishes

> Dear list,
> I'm pleased to announce that Castellanie.net, a website publishing images a=
nd soon transcriptions of the XIIIth century account rolls of the House of Sa=
voy, now proposes self-corrective online paleography exercices to help studen=
ts and beginners to learn how to read those accounts. Four exercices are avai=
lable now, with more to come. They can be accessed from the main website (www=
.castellanie.net) or directly at this URL:
> http://paleographie.castellanie.net
>
> What may also be of interest to some of you is that those exercices are gen=
erated directly from Image Markup Tool, thanks to a customized XSL, CSS and J=
avascript, making it very easy to create new exercices, including for scholar=
s with zero web design skills.
> I plan to make the XSL / CSS / Javascript available online very soon, after=
 just a little bit of polishing.
> Besides, as we plan to extend the collection of exercices, any feedback abo=
ut the interface, functionalities, etc. will be most welcome :)
>
> Best regards, an Happy New Year!
