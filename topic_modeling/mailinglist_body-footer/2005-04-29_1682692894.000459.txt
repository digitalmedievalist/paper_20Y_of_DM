	Just a quick reminder about the digital sessions at Kalamazoo this 
year: if you are attending the conference, you can print off the handy 
program in our wiki: http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Kalamazoo_2005I'd also like to remind those attending about our business meeting at 
noon on Friday in Fetzer 1060. Our goal for the meeting is to discuss 
ways in which we can go forward collectively. This might involve 
coordinating conference sessions at Leeds and Kalamazoo. Publicising 
projects via the DM site. etc.-dan
