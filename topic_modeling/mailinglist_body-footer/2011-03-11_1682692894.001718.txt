Medievalist Journal. Two peer-reviewed articles and three book reviews 
cover a wide range of our field, from scholarly editing to computational 
reconstruction of damaged manuscripts. We hope you enjoy the reading and 
look forward to your feedback and discussion on the list.As usual, the table of contents and all contributions are available in 
open access at http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/. Through our 
new interface, you can also easily access past issues of the journal.The preparations for the seventh issue have already started. We are 
looking for outstanding contributions--research articles as well as 
reviews of books and especially digital resources--to be published in 
the course of 2011. Get in touch with us 
(editors(a)digitalmedievalist.org) to discuss opportunities. And stay 
tuned for a special issue of the Digital Medievalist Journal later this 
year.The editors
