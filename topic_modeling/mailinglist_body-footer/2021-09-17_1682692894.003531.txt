/> and I<https://history.uccs.edu/roger-martinez>, are announcing a call for =
participants for our Immersive Global Middle Ages NEH Institute for Advanced =
Topics in the Digital Humanities.Virtual reality, augmented reality, and 3D digital environments are witnessin=
g explosive growth in research and teaching, but faculty and staff who could =
benefit from these techniques do not have equal access to the tools they need=
. Hardware and software used in the creation of 3D environments is expensive;=
 institutional policies and commitment are highly variable; and some who woul=
d benefit lack confidence with the technology. The Immersive Global Middle Ag=
es Institute provides a diverse cohort of medievalists with both theoretical =
and practical training in the creation and implementation of 3D objects and e=
nvironments for research and teaching. The Institute will meet online three t=
imes each semester and will have two in-person four-day summer workshops over=
 a two-year period (January 2022-November 2023). By the end of the Institute,=
 participants will have considered the research around using 3D environments,=
 developed 3D object assets and worlds, and authored teaching resources to pa=
ss on their new skills to students and colleagues.Given that many participants will lack the necessary robust computing hardwar=
e and software needed to participate in the workshops, the Institute will awa=
rd technology stipends to participants for the purchase of an Alienware compu=
ter customized for immersive technology, monitor, keyboard/mouse, and a 3-yea=
r onsite support/warranty; an Oculus Rift headset; and a two-year license for=
 Trimble SketchUp Pro modeling software.Initial details about the Institute can be found here: https://grants.uccs.ed=
u/igma/
All are welcome to apply. Recognizing the need to address digital divides in =
higher education, this Institute will prioritize the professional development=
 of participants who are members of underrepresented ethnic, cultural, and re=
ligious communities; women; diverse gender identities; and those who work at =
institutions serving those communities. Expenses to attend the in-person work=
shops are also covered by the institute.We will begin accepting formal applications for the institute in late Septemb=
er 2021. To receive updates on the application process, please send your name=
, position, institution, and email address to: igma(a)uccs.edu<mailto:igma(a)=
ucca.edu>.Best,
Roger
