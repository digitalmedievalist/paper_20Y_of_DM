own Arianna Ciula and Paul Stokes. My understanding from a talk I heard
her give last year in London is that it is a holy grail of OCR
companies, but nowhere near practical. I'm not an expert on the current state of this field, but I believe the
approach currently is at best to assist humans in the interpretation of
characters by looking for patterns that can be highlighted, rather than
attempt to replace humans in interpret strings of manuscript text. So in
this regard something like how we used to use photocopiers to increase
contrast or different types of light to emphasis different types of
strokes or ink. But now going farther than this in looking for patterns
that can then be approved or interpreted by a human.So my sense is that if the question is "can I use a computer to avoid
keying the content of this manuscript into a computer?" the answer is
no. But if the question is "can I use a computer to help me recognise,
interpret, or classify aspects or characters in this script?" the answer
is yes depending on the specific issues you are looking at analysing.Good convenient starting places on the current state of the field are
the articles in DM by Paul Stokes (newly published in DM 3:
http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/3/stokes/) and Arianna Ciula
(DM 1: http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/1.1/ciula/)[1]. We have
a review coming of Terras's book _Image to Interpretation: An
intelligent system to aid historians in reading the Vindolanda texts_
(Oxford: 2006).-dan[1] If you haven't been to the DM site in a while, you'll see it has
been improved and reorganised. Old URLs for journal articles should
still work however.On Fri, 2008-03-21 at 13:58 -0400, Dot Porter wrote:
