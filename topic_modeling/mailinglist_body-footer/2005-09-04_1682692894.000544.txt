about the Wiki based page on digital sessions at Kalamazoo 2006:
http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Kalamazoo_2006. Currently this
lists calls for papers (if you have one that is not listed, please
consider adding it: it is not hard and we can help if you need it).Once the sessions are submitted and approved, we will use this as a
programme for digital sessions at the 2006 conference in much the same
way we did last year for Kalamazoo 2005:
http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Kalamazoo_2005. There are
similar pages for the Leeds conferences. If you know of another event or
conference that you would like to do something similar with, please feel
free to add it (or ask us to add text for you if you are worried about
adding stuff to a wiki).-dan
