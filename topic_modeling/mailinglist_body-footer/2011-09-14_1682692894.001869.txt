panelists.  Remember, you can be a panelist AND give a paper in another
session at Kalamazoo.----------------------The Digital Medievalist is sponsoring a session at Kalamazoo 2012
entitled: Panel Discussion on Sustainability in Digital Medieval StudiesThis panel will lead a discussion on how medievalists should address the
issue of sustainability in digital projects. Once the grant runs out, how do
we ensure our new projects will survive?  This issue not only concerns
continued accessibility but also the sticky questions about hardware and
storage, about ensuring application interfaces remain usable, etc. Each
panelist will make a short presentation of no more than 10 minutes, so that
the bulk of the session will be devoted to a panel-led discussion.If you are interested in participating in this panel session, please send
your name, institutional affiliation (but independant scholars and
non-academics are most welcome!), contact details (address, phone and
email), and whether you require any A/V for your short presentation.please send these details to James Ginther (ginthej(a)slu.edu).Thanks
Jim
