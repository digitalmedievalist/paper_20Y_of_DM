importance of ad-hoc DIY digitization even without elaborate set-ups and
procedures. Even a modest digital camera can go an awfully long way towards
improving visibility of manuscripts (though obviously insufficient for
official archival purposes). From a community standpoint (complicated
logistical issues aside for the moment), I think that a large open access
repository of legible images, even if some are subject to poor lighting and
shaky hands, is far more valuable than a much smaller collection of more
painstakingly produced digitizations. Ideally, we can pursue both at the
same time. But I think it's useful to keep in mind what a tremendous
resource even our quick and dirty image work can become--and that we
shouldn't be discouraged from jumping in with an itchy trigger finger simply
because we're worried that we're not following official best practices.The above comments probably reveal my preference for thinking about how to
create and utilize an open access image repository (perhaps more of a social
challenge than a technical one) rather than the logistics of producing
images in the first place. Though by no means do I mean to minimize the
challenges of digitization. Indeed, the discussion of how to meet the
threshold of utility in image creation is a crucial first step. But a larger
(and somewhat utopian) vision of manuscript image access, even with a
latitude of image quality, is perhaps worth bearing in mind as best
practices are worked out.Fred Gibbs2010/10/28 <dm-l-request(a)uleth.ca>> Send dm-l mailing list submissions to

>> Hi,

>> This obviously calls for a "best practice" guide somewhere...
