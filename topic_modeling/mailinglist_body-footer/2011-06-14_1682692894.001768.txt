4th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the
Digital Age
October 21-22, 2011 
Writing the East: History and New Technologies in the Study of Asian
Manuscript Traditions
In partnership with the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of
Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and
Anthropology, Penn Libraries are pleased to announce the 4th annual
<http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/lectures/ljs_symposium.html> Lawrence
J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age. This
year's symposium will explore a range of issues relating to Asian reading
and writing cultures, especially as they pertain to the manuscript source.
Our focus will be on Asian manuscripts from the Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist,
Taoist, and Confucian traditions. We will bring together scholars
representing these traditions to examine the ways in which hand-produced
texts shape both meaning and interpretation, and to a larger extent, the
cultural norms that define their use.  We will also consider the role that
modern digital technology can play in facilitating the study of manuscripts
today.
Registration opens August 15. For more information, go to
