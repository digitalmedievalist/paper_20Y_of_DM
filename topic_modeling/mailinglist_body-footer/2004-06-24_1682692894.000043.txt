Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHi all,My preference would be for alternative XSL renderings; one would produce a 
pure Unicode text for those with adequate fonts, and an alternative 
transformation would identify characters not covered by any of the fonts 
commonly distributed with most OSes, and either substitute something at 
least usable (such as a plain s for historical long s, allowing 
readability) or some sign such as [s], with an explanation of its 
signification at the beginning of the text.Cheers,
