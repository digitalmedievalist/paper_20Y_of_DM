XML.  Which then could certainly be queried with XQuery or transformed with
XSLT.  I'd be interested in what form you have the texts at the moment, or
whether you are starting from scratch.What I'd suggest is not to limit yourself necessarily to one technology, but =
use
those applications which are fit for purpose.  Excel is good at typical
spreadsheet applications and some statistical work, Access (and other RDMS li=
ke
mysql) are good at relating large tables of non-nested information, SPSS is
quite good at performing statistical analysis, XML Databases are good at
enabling queries between hierarchically structured documents.We have, thankfully, reached a point where putting your information in any one
of these does not stop you exporting, transforming, and importing portions of
the information into another application.  There are other options, such as
linguistic analysis software such as Xaira.My advice generally with textual materials is to create a a detailed text in a
neutral an easily transformable format (and for me this is TEI XML), and then
generate the input expected by other programs when needed.  For example, a CSV
file to import into Access or Excel.  To me comparing formulaic patterns with
punctuation is a form of textual analysis akin to computational linguistics, =
and
so I would use markup (say a teiCorpus structure) and any existing tools where
applicable.Let us know how you get along,-James--=20
