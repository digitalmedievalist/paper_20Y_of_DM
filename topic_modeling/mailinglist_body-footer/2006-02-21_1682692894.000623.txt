(http://www.refworks.com/)? It looks like a pay-as-you-go on-line
reference manager that has many of the features of standalone products
like Procite and Endnote.While I'd prefer an open-source replacement for Procite, I've not been
able to find something suitable yet. This looks like it might be a
decent stop-gap. Does anybody have any experience with it?-dan--===============6556686880953625294==--
