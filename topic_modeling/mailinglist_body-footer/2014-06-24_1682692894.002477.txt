Tarrin Wills, Semantic linking of the Pre-Christian Religions of the 
North (http://digitalmedievalist.org/journal/9/wills/).Abstract: The Sources strand of the Pre-Christian Religions of the North 
project aims to bring together and document the primary evidence for the 
early religions of Northern Europe. In order to be useful for 
researchers these sources must include metadata or semantic links that 
can connect them to concepts relevant to the study of religions. This 
paper outlines ways in which some very different source types, including 
textual sources, place-names, pictures and figurines, can be 
incorporated into a single resource. The aim is to both facilitate 
analysis and to separate documentary processes from interpretative ones. 
This structure has been tested using a web interface for both searching 
and data entry. Some possibilities for representing the visual and 
spatial data associated with the proposed resource are also demonstrated.Enjoy reading!
