from a luxurious position. Wow, having your own Humanities Computing Centre, 
with stable funding and reliable job opportunities for 
researcher/programmers. Brilliant, I'm truly jealous! In The Netherlands 
(and I guess in other countries too) we're only having a toehold on stable 
funding for computational aspects in Humanities. Most programming, research 
and development in Humanities Computing is still ad hoc and moreover ad hoc 
funded. Imagine: lone researchers that somewhere along the way grasped the 
potentials of information technology cowboy coding away. Do not even think 
of stable coding environments, shared languages, good programming practices 
and standards compliance! (Okay, I might be exaggerating somewhat for the 
benefit of clearness:)It's of course only in proving the added value of computational approaches 
that we should be able to gain firmer ground. But in that case it would 
clearly help us a lot when building tools would also benefit one's academic 
esteem.Having said that, I totally disagree with Martin's last point. Open sourcing 
is not about abandoning your source code. It's about giving the Humanities 
community insight in what you are doing for benefit of academic review and 
control. Research based on computation should always be reproducible and 
controllable by peers. Also peers should be able to do code review to 
control the exact and correct working of any algorithm. That can only be 
accomplished by open sourcing your code bases. y.s.,
