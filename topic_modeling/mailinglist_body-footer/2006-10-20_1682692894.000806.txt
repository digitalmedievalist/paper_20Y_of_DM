homepage--I mean the page one uses for class material, information on
research, etc.I tend to use wikis a lot now for personal notekeeping and the like, and
I very much like the way they work: very easy to enter new material and
edit old material, for example. But, apart from the fact that they can
be edited easily, Wikis are obviously more like a card catalogue than a
structured site. You can give them structure with categories, but it
isn't natural to them.What I'd love to find is some kind of similar system for more structured
sets of pages: something where I could easily edit, say, the index page
by simply calling it up, and where I could get an over view of the
relationships of all the other pages (In general, I try to keep pages
where they are so that I can find them again when students need to know
what was taught in 1999; that can make things unwieldy): copy previous
syllabi and edit the new representations, etc., preferably WYSIWIG or
with minimal tagging.Anybody have any suggestions? I don't mind experimenting with
server-based software (I set up and break down the wikis all the time,
after all), though an export/publish function might be required in the
end, as my university space is pretty much for storage I believe rather
than running software from.Linux-based solutions are better: I think our university server is
Redhat.Thanks in advance,-dan--===============3775783923859780659==--
