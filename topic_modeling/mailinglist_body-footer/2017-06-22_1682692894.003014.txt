The president and members of the Royal Historical Commission of Belgium are h=
appy to announce the updated version of the online charter database Diplomata=
 Belgica, now available at http://www.diplomata-belgica.be?Diplomata Belgica offers a critical survey of all the diplomatic sources, edi=
ted or still unpublished, and issued by both natural persons and legal bodies=
 from the medieval Southern Low Countries. Diplomata Belgica covers present d=
ay Belgium as well as those areas which belonged historically to the Southern=
 Low Countries but are part now of France (French Flanders, French Hainault),=
 the Netherlands (parts of the provinces of Zeeland, Noord-Brabant, Limburg),=
 the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, or Germany (parts of the Rhineland). At this =
stage, Diplomata Belgica contains metadata of about 35,000 charters and deeds=
 in Latin, Old-French, Middle Dutch and Middle High German, almost 19,000 ful=
l text transcriptions and 5,000 photographs of original charters. As for the =
seals, the database also provides links to the online corpus of seal moulds d=
eveloped by the National Archives of Belgium. Diplomata Belgica aims at exhau=
stivity for the period before 1250 and will, in the future, also include late=
 medieval diplomatic material, without striving after completeness.Diplomata Belgica. The Diplomatic Sources from the Medieval Southern Low Coun=
