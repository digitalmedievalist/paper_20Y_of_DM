(http://gucharmap.sourceforge.net/): it allows you to browse all
characters/fonts present in your system and to look for specific
characters/code points. For instance, you can search the string "latin
small letter a with" to find all combination of 'a' with accents, dots,
macron, etc. Then you can copy the desired character(s) in a text field,
and even type more text using the keyboard, so that you're ready to copy
and paste the resulting string in your document. Very useful.[*] It's an application for the GNOME desktop, so it actually runs
wherever GNOME runs: Linux, *BSD, Unix, Solaris.Ciao-- Roberto Rosselli Del Turco	roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
