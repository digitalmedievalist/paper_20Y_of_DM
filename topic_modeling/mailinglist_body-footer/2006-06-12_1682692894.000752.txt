With apologies for cross-postingEXTENDED DEADLINE FOR FUNDED PhD STUDENTSHIPS ON 'ENGLISH MANUSCRIPTS
1060 TO 1220' PROJECTThe deadline for applications for the two studentships attached to the
AHRC-funded 'English Manuscripts 1060 to 1220' project has been extended
to 14 August 2006.  The studentships are open to UK and EU nationals.Please tell any students you know who might be interested in applying
for the Leicester or Leeds studentship, or for both.  We're particularly
interested in applications from students who have experience in Old or
Middle English literary/linguistic/manuscript studies.  If you know
students who have already made regular AHRC PhD applications, do tell
them that they're welcome to apply for an English Manuscripts project
studentship as well, since by the time we announce our decision, the
AHRC is likely to have made its own announcements to applicants for its
regular PhD studentships.Full details of the studentships can be found at
http://www.le.ac.uk/ee/em1060to1220/index.htm.  Potential applicants who
would like to discuss the studentships are very welcome to contact
Elaine Treharne (emt1(a)leicester.ac.uk) or Mary Swan
(m.t.swan(a)leeds.ac.uk) directly.
