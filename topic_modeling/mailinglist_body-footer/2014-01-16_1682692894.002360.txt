lists have been under what seems to have been intended as a sustain DoS 
attack (actually its not clear what the point of the attack was other 
than to be annoying): tens of subscription requests a minute from a 
limited number of addresses to all publicly available pages. The result 
is that list administrators have been overwhelmed by noise from their 
subscription pages (I just trashed 2k requests from the last few days).Lost in that noise have almost certainly been some real requests. 
Indeed, when I just checked now (the DoS seems to have calmed down), the 
majority of requests looked legitimate: real email addresses and real 
names that seemed to match the email addresses in the names boxes.If you know somebody who tried to join dm-l in the last two months, or 
if you recommended to somebody that they join dm-l in that time, could 
you check with them to see if they were ignored or rejected (you get an 
email when you are subscribed). And if they were, ask them to try 
resubscribing?The URL is here: http://listserv.uleth.ca/mailman/listinfo/dm-lBecause it isn't 100% clear that the problem has stopped (our IT 
department is supposed to be working on installing a captcha to prevent 
automatic signups but hasn't done it yet), they should bother me 
personally if they can't get on this time.Thanks and apologies for this inconvenience.-dan--
