f Zurich, all abbreviations from the =C2=ABCappelli=C2=BB have been digitised=
 and are now fully searchable.In October 2015, the University of Zurich hosted the Cappelli-Hackathon, a ve=
ry successful crowd sourcing project, during which all 14'357 abbreviations c=
ollected in Adriano Cappellis' =C2=ABLexicon abbreviaturarum=C2=BB were digit=
ally registered and systematised through a specifically for the task designed=
 web interface. Since then, the registered abbreviations have been checked an=
d =E2=80=93 where necessary =E2=80=93 corrected through expert validation. Th=
ey are as of now freely available, either as part of the Ad fontes platform (=
Cappelli online) or through the new app, App fontes.The search interface not only allows to search by the readable letters, with =
the possiblity to set wildcards for non-identifiable characters, but also to =
search by visual criteria. Through the use of a 3x3 grid, the abbreviations h=
ave been systematised by the placement of abbreviation marks and other visual=
 features; user may now use this grid in the search interface to help them fi=
nd results.Thus, the project allows a better and easier way to access the =C2=ABCappelli=
=C2=BB, an invaluable tool for everyone working with handwritten sources. Sin=
ce =C2=ABAd fontes=C2=BB offers also a link to the digitised original page, i=
t is even possible to cite from the =C2=ABLexicon abbreviaturarum=C2=BB using=
 the project.P.S.: The data as well as the pictures can be downloaded (http://www.adfontes=
