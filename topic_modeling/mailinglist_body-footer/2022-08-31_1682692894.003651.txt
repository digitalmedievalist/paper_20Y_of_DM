I wanted to let you know about an ICMS session on the future of manuscript st=
udies (blended, paper session).  Possible topics include: the digital humanit=
ies, new theoretical approaches, and interdisciplinary initiatives.The International Christine de Pizan Society=E2=80=94North American Branch wi=
ll sponsor *two* sessions at Kalamazoo ICMS 2023 (11-13 May), including:
Session 1:
The Future of Manuscript Studies: Honoring the Legacy of Angus J. Kennedy and=
 Liliane Dulac (paper session, blended format)
Sponsored by: The International Christine de Pizan Society=E2=80=94North Amer=
ican Branch
This look toward the future of manuscript studies will emphasize the enduring=
 impact of two of the most prolific, pioneering, and respected scholars in th=
e field of Christine studies, both of whom were lost during a period of just =
under six months in 2021=E2=80=932022. Areas of potential interest for this s=
ession include, among others, the digital humanities, new theoretical approac=
hes, and interdisciplinary initiatives. We seek to explore new horizons in ma=
nuscript studies that will honor, in any number of ways, the pioneering work =
of Angus J. Kennedy and Liliane Dulac.
