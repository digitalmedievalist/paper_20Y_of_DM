electronic resources in Anglo-Saxon studies for the _Old English
Newsletter_.If you have come across (or created) in the past year any new or
substantially revised/updated resources (websites, databases, CD-ROMs,
audio/video recordings, e-journals, and the like) that you have
particularly found useful, I would greatly appreciate hearing about
them, so that I might add them to the growing list of resources we
already have.You can send notices to me off-list, at foys(a)hood.eduThanks much,Martin Foys
