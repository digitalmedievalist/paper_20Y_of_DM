I've got a couple of questions about Junicode, I'm posting here on DM-L
as I think others might be interested in your answers. Thanks in
advance.1. I casually noticed that a new version is out AND that there is an
announce mailing list: perhaps announcements of new releases could also
be forwarded to dm-l? I subscribed to the announcement ml, but it could
be useful for those on this list who haven't subscribed (yet).2. Installation under Linux: the instructions are very clear, but I
noticed that there is a file (/etc/defoma/hints/ttf-junicode.hints) in
my installation not included in the zip archive, is this file created
using the "fc-cache junicode" command? Doesn't seem the case at first
look.3. I'm very glad to see that Junicode is slowly but surely becoming a
fully MUFI compliant font, but what about characters not yet in MUFI?
what's the best way to ask for their inclusion? filing a feature request
to MUFI first (and putting you in CC:)? or you'd be glad to consider it
first?4. I really like the (oldish) Beowulf-1 font, any plans to revamp it or
include it inside Junicode's PUA (I would settle with that)? Hope this
request doesn't sound too weird :)Again on Junicode under Linux: Debian offers excellent support, the
latest version is already available as a standard DEB package (unstable
branch); for RPM based distros I built an RPM package which has been
accepted in the Mandriva contrib repository, but it needs to be updated
to the latest version (hence question n. 2).Ciao--
