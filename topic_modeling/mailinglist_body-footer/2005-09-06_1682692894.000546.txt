>This session hopes to feature both real practices and 
imagined ideals 
>for crafting a better presentation of data in electronic 
critical 
>editions. While some presentations may deal in part with 
tools or 
>initiatives for developers, the focus is really on the user. 
Are

the user 
>to access complex data? What tools can we provide that 
facilitate the 
>user's experience with an ancient text? In what ways can we 
yet 
>exploit the new media to enhance the interaction of the 
reader with a 
>textual tradition? What are some best practices in designing
