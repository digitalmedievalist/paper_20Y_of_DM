*Vagantes 2012*
March 29-31
Indiana University, BloomingtonVagantes is the largest conference in North America for graduate students
studying the Middle Ages, and aims to provide an open dialogue among junior
scholars from all fields of medieval studies. This yearâ€™s conference will
feature keynote speakers Shannon Gayk (Associate Professor of English,
Indiana University) and Professor Jordan L. Zweck (Assistant Professor of
English, University of Wisconsin-Madison). They will be joined by at least
twenty-four student presenters and an audience of approximately 100 people.
Vagantes emphasizes interdisciplinary scholarship; each year, presenters
from backgrounds as varied as Comparative Literature, Archaeology,
Art History, Classics, History, Anthropology, English, Philosophy,
Manuscript Studies, Musicology, and Religious Studies come together to
exchange ideas. In this manner, Vagantes fosters a sense of community for
junior medievalists of diverse backgrounds, and because the conference
does not have a registration fee, this community can flourish within the
margins of a graduate student budget.Abstracts for twenty-minute papers are welcome from graduate students on
all topics considering the Middle Ages. In keeping with the mission of
Vagantes to advance interdisciplinary studies, we invite submissions in
areas including but not limited to history, literature, art
history, philosophy, religious studies, and musicology.Vagantes is sponsored by the Medieval Academy of America.Please email a brief vitae and abstract of no more than 300 words by October
25, 2011 to:Diane Fruchtman
