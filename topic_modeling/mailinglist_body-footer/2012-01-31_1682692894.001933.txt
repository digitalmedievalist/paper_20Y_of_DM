Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitAnother release of Junicode, the font for medievalists. This one 
tightens up the spacing of uppercase diacritics so as to get closer line 
spacing in certain Windows applications. Other changes are mainly 
technical/quality control.Get it at http://junicode.sourceforge.net (choose from TrueType, WOFF 
and source files)If any user cares to leave a comment at the Junicode site, I'd 
appreciate it. The font gets its share of "likes," but the only comment 
there complains about the line spacing, which has now been fixed.Thanks!
