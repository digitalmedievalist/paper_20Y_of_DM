that every style can be so particular to need a very specific 
terminology for its description.Secondly, the danger is that different projects, departing from TEI 
guidelines, develop their own extensions, creating another variety of 
terms that will add to the huge variety already evident in the 
traditional literature.Arianna Ciula
