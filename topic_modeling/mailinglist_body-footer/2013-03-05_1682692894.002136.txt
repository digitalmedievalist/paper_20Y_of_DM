Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHi all,I have a tangential topic: what is normal practice regarding screen 
shots in print and PDF?I have an article coming out and the production manager wants 300 dpi 
TIFFs for my images. But the images are for the most part screen shots 
and, since I'm talking /about/ navigation and representation issues in 
virtual environments, I can't go with the second option they offered me: 
giving URLs rather than presenting that actual images in the text.I'm sure I've seen screenshots in both print and PDFs before. What is 
normal practice?-dan
