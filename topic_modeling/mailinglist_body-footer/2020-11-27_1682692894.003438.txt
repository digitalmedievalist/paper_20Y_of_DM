International Symposium =E2=80=9CTextual Heritage in the 21st Century World. =
Exploring the Potential of a New Analytic Category=E2=80=9D
Ca' Foscari University of Venice,
Hosted on Zoom, March 22-24, 2021Website: https://www.unive.it/textualheritage
Submission Deadline: December 21, 2020Keynote Speakers
Wiebke Denecke (MIT)
David C. Harvey (Aarhus University)We cordially invite proposals for the International symposium =E2=80=9CTextua=
l Heritage in the 21st Century World=E2=80=9D, to be hosted virtually by Ca=
' Foscari University of Venice (on Zoom).Main topics  *   Processes of canonization and heritagization of texts
  *   Hegemonic mechanisms of world literature and authorized heritage discou=
rses
  *   The =E2=80=9CUNESCO Memory of the World=E2=80=9D and the problem of aut=
henticity
  *   Heritage and materiality
  *   Non-European systems of musical notation
  *   Musical reconstructions
  *   The ownership, authorship, and copyright of textual products
  *   Any other aspect related to written texts and their heritagizationAim
Heritage is spreading as a contagious academic category. Food heritage, herit=
age railways, smell heritage... the popularity of the word suggests that a ne=
w paradigm is quickly taking root across the Humanities and Social Sciences. =
At the same time, surprisingly, manuscripts, books, and other textual product=
s have been notably absent from the interdisciplinary debate over intangible =
cultural heritage (ICH), despite their substantial cultural capital. This int=
ernational symposium aims to explore the meanings and potentialities of textu=
al heritage as a new analytic category through which we can challenge the spl=
it between tangible and intangible heritage. Given the increasingly connected=
 and digitalized nature of research in the 21st century, we believe this deba=
te is both timely and necessary. With this symposium, we wish to strengthen a=
 dialogue between the Humanities and the Social Sciences through the interdis=
ciplinary area of =E2=80=9Cheritage studies=E2=80=9D. Bringing together both =
present-oriented approaches to texts and societies and disciplines that explo=
re history and memory, our aim is to emphasize the role of modern and premode=
rn texts in shaping cultural identities. We expand current notions of textual=
ity, stretching the limits of what a text can be and do. Therefore, we adopt =
a broad approach to texts and their materiality, welcoming contributions that=
 deal with all kinds of documents resulting from a technology of inscription.=
 Such an inclusive conception of =E2=80=9Ctext=E2=80=9D encompasses manuscrip=
ts, epigraphs, musical notations, architectural plans and maps, both in analo=
g and digital formats. We welcome theoretical contributions and case studies =
that engage with the concept of textual heritage, exploring how =E2=80=9Ctext=
s=E2=80=9D are produced, used and re-created in order to make sense of the re=
lation between past and present.Guidelines for SubmissionWe invite abstracts for 30-minute presentations, followed by 15 minutes of ge=
neral discussion.
=E2=80=A2  Abstracts should not exceed 500 words, excluding references but in=
cluding tables and charts.
=E2=80=A2  All abstracts should be submitted in English, which will also be t=
he language of the conference.
=E2=80=A2  Please include a short biography of approximately 250 words.Please submit your abstract and biography in a single PDF file by sending an =
email to edoardo.gerlini(a)unive.it<mailto:edoardo.gerlini(a)unive.it> before=
 December 21, 2020.We plan to collect some of the papers presented at our symposium, substantial=
ly revised, and publish them as an edited volume.For any questions or inquiries, please send an email to a.giolai(a)hum.leiden=
