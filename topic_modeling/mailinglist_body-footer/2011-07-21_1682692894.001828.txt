Text-Image Linking Environment (TILE) is a web-based tool for creating and
editing image-based electronic editions and digital archives of humanities
texts. This version of TILE includes:   - Import/export of TEI P5, and the ability to easily create custom data
   importers
   - Improved workflow and accuracy using the Auto Line Recognizer (ALR)
   - An improved API for plugin developers
   - Enhancements and bug fixes to TILE’s interface
   - Detailed release notes for more information
A MITH-hosted sandbox version of TILE allows you to test the tool online
without installing it on your machine. We encourage users to download a copy
to install on their own servers to customize the tool. Users can import
their own data into the software, or get started by playing with pre-loaded
data of Algernon Swinburne’s poem Anactoria, provided by John Walsh at
Indiana University.The development of TILE has been supported by an NEH Preservation and Access
Grant, and it is a collaboration between the Maryland Institute for
Technology in the Humanities (Dave Lester, Grant Dickie, Jim Smith, Doug
Reside) and Indiana University (Dot Porter, John Walsh, Jeffrey Mudge, Tim
Bowman). We’d love to hear how you are using TILE, and what questions or
suggestions you have, either in blog comments or on the TILE forums.--
