Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Peter,How about the following:<div class=3D"vl">
hr=C4=93ran mid hondum hr=C4=ABmcealde s=C7=A3,
</div>
<div class=3D"n">5</div>
<div class=3D"vl">
 wadan wr=C3=A6cl=C4=81stas. Wyrd bi=C3=B0 ful =C4=81r=C7=A3d.
</div>div.vl {margin-left:6em; text-indent: -2em;}
div.n {
	float: left;
}This way, all the verse lines have the same class and the number div is befor=
e the line it applies to, not in it.I tried it on IE 8, FF 3.6, Chrome 5, Safari 4, and Safari on the iPhone.  Wo=
rked with no problem.  If you'd like me to check it with IE 7, I can tomorrow=
.  I wouldn't worry about IE 6.Best,
