the PDFs, and from what source (is she scanning TIFFs and creating PDFs from =
them, or scanning directly to PDF using Acrobat, or something else?)
It appears that JSTOR is using Atypon Systems PDFPlus software (http://www.at=
ypon.com/solutions/pdfplus/) to generate their PDFs on the fly, which might e=
xplain why theirs are smaller (I don't know anything about this software, but=
 smaller sizes seems to be one of their selling points). =20________________________________________

Jstor can do that to you - I  had a version of that today, trying to
print a 21' X 12"  menu on a regular sheet of paper. I finally found the
correct "fit to page" box: there were 4 different places that purported
