Journal of Medieval CulturesCall for Submissions, 2016 and 2017 Open Issues_Digital
Philology_ is a peer-reviewed journal devoted to the study of
medieval vernacular texts and cultures. Founded by Stephen G. Nichols and Nad=
ia
R. Altschul, _Digital Philology_ aims to foster scholarship that crosses disc=
iplines
upsetting traditional fields of study, national boundaries and
periodizations. _Digital
Philology_ also encourages both applied and theoretical research
that engages with the digital humanities and shows why and how digital
resources require new questions, new approaches, and yield radical
results. The Johns Hopkins University Press publishes two journal issues per
year. One is open to all submissions, while the other is guest-edited, and re=
volves
around a thematic axis.
Articles must be written in English, follow the latest edition of the MLA sty=
le
manual, and be about 8,000 words in length, including abstract, footnotes, and
list of works cited. Quotations in the main text in languages other than
English should appear along with their English translation._Digital
Philology_ is welcoming submissions for its 2016 and 2017 open
issues. Inquiries and submissions (as a Word document attachment) should be
sent to dph(a)jhu.edu, addressed to the Managing Editor (Albert
Lloret). Digital Philology also
publishes manuscript studies and reviews of books and digital projects.
Correspondence regarding manuscript studies may be addressed to Jeanette
Patterson at jpatterson09(a)gmail.com.
Correspondence regarding digital projects and publications for review may be
addressed to Timothy Stinson at tlstinson(a)gmail.com.=20[http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/digital_philology/index.html]_Editorial Staff_Albert Lloret, Managing Editor   =20University of
