s available for page 141 of the St Chad Gospels. Page 141 appears as if it mi=

 offer enhanced viewing of this area. Also, my viewer allows any of the multi=
spectral visualizations to be overlaid with either the RGB or ultraviolet ima=
ge and transparency adjusted to sort out interferences from what might be rem=
nants of text: https://lichfield.as.uky.edu/content/page-141-multispectral .If you have any questions or comments, please contact me: bill.endres(a)uky.e=
