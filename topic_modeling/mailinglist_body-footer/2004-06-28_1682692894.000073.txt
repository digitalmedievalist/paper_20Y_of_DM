esign person last week as the answers came in and wanted to wait until I'd he=
ard from him. Then I forgot to return to it.The AHDS primers have all been very good, though I believe not all are comple=
tely up-to-date. If you are new and don't know about these (and if you are no=
t new and don't know about them, it is worth repeating the address Robert Hau=
g gave us <http://www.ahds.ac.uk/creating/guides/index.htm>.The project management is also huge. Humanities computing projects are almost=
 invariably underfunded and especially understaffed, meaning that a person wi=
th a PhD in some arcane medieval speciality also has to become a specialist i=
n the arcana of markup languages in order to bring their work to market. It w=
as partially to improve that process that we decided to set this up: hopefull=
y we can improve efficiency by pooling the "secondary" knowledge we have acqu=
ired in the course of our projects.What I was asking our web designer about was including a wiki-style encyclope=
dia in the site. I believe we are going to be able to do it. For those of you=
 who don't know what this is: <http://www.wikipedia.org/> This is an encyclop=
edia that is built and edited by the community of users. I'm not up 100% on t=
he organisational details of the link I've just given you, but in essence, a =
member of a community writes an entry, and this is improved on and/or edited =
by other members of the community as they are able to do so.=20There is some danger of vandalism, of course, though this appears to be a min=
or problem (and would be especially in a small group like this), but it is a =
particularly good way of building up a knowledge based aimed at a specific co=
mmunity. It is less good at progressive knowledge (i.e. a series of lessons),=
 but is very handy otherwise.A second thing we have been tossing around for a while involves developing gu=
ides to best practice. A very good one for medieval Norse is <http://helmer.a=
ksis.uib.no/menota/guidelines/contents/contents_1-1.html>.If particular sub-communities were interested in developing these, we would p=
ublish them as a subsidia series.
Cheers.
