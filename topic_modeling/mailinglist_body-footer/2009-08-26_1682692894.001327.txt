need different views of the underlying XML depending on what their=20
interests are, and it is easy in cocoon to create an extensible=20
URL-based pipeline for all the different possibilities.: my first choice=20
was, as always, just a straight Apache XML site, but we needed the=20
flexibility for this.Cocoon has had a module that does basically what you suggest below since=20
2.1--I spent a lot of time looking up pre-2.1 ways of doing things=20
before discovering this! The real question is whether there is an=20
off-the-shelf backend I can point it to that doesn't require me to do a=20
lot of programming or learning new systems.Thanks very much!-danHugh Cayless wrote:
