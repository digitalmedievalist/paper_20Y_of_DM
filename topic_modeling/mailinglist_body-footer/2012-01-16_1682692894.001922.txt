you can see the new advanced typography support in that browser 
tested/demonstrated with Junicode here:http://faculty.virginia.edu/OldEnglish/juntest/Insular letter-shapes, true small caps, historical forms, and more, 
including (my personal favorite) reversed and mirrored runes. I hope 
very much that this kind of typography will eventually be supported in 
all the major browsers.PBOn 1/16/12 7:43 AM, Peter Baker wrote:
