entirely TEI/logocentric in its approach to the data. For an 
alternative approach, you might also want to look into the work of 
Satoko Tokunaga and Tomohiro Kishida at Keio University, Japan. They gave a fantastic talk last summer at Peter Robinson's New 
Technology/Old Text conference on â€œComputer-assisted analysis of 
Caxton's Typography," in which they demonstrate software they had 
developed for morphological analysis of individual characters. Very 
impressive stuff, and an important addition to the usual mode of 
trying to describe visual shapes through textual descriptions.~ Martin Foys
