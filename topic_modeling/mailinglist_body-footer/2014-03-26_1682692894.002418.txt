on this list, at New Mexico Highlands University, in Las Vegas, New 
Mexico (http://its.nmhu.edu/announcementsPIX/%5C/005100.pdf).The position title is Assistant Professor of English Tenure-Track 
(English Language and Linguistics), but the ad indicates that Old 
English would be considered an advantage and I know from speaking to 
people there that they mean that. The job is to succeed Barbara Risch on 
her retirement. In addition to language, OE was one of her areas of 
specialisation. The deadline is the 31 March but UNMH accepts 
applications until the position is filled, so if you think this might be 
for you, you can certainly still apply.I happened to be in Las Vegas New Mexico last week (Las Vegas NM is the 
original Las Vegas, different from the much larger Casino city in 
Nevada). UNMH is a relatively old University in American terms (1893) on 
a beautiful campus in the middle of town. The city of Las Vegas itself 
is well known in the region for its preserved architecture, which ranges 
from pre-U.S. adobe houses through Queen Anne and Modernist styles. It 
is also home to the Armand Hammer United World College-USA, an elite 
International Baccalaureate boarding school. The load is 28 
credits/year, which I believe breaks down to 4:4.For more information, contact Dr. Helen Blythe, Chair of the Department 
of English at (505) 454-3329 or helenblythe(a)nmhu.edu.-dan--
