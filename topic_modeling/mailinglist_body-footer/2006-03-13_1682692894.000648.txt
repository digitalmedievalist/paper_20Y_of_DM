while I fully agree with James about the excellent Manuscript 
Description module (and other goodies in TEI P5), I can't but point out 
that there currently is a deep imbalance between manuscript 
*description* and manuscript *transcription* features in TEI P4/P5. The 
MS transcription SIG was going to deal with lots of interesting stuff 
(time based encoding, substitution/variation issues, revision of the 
transcription chapter, etc.) but discussion seems to have stopped (at 
least on the mailing list, I also wonder if there was a SIG meeting in 
2005 like in 2003-04).I would be very keen to see a restart of the SIG activities. As quite a 
few people mentioned their specific solutions to MS transcription 
problems, I also think it could be interesting to collect and compare 
this information to see what could be used/adapted/useful for 
inspiration for TEI P5.Ciao--
