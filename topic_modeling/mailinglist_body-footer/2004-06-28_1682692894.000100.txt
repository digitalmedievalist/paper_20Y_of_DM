and Media Centre, and we actually spun off a company that makes money out 
of this stuff and feeds some of it back into our unit to support other 
projects. Times change!Our cloze stuff is of course nothing like as sophisticated as what you 
describe; it's aimed at regular instructors who want to make simple 
exercises easily and post them on a Web server without having to worry 
about anything being installed on the server, so they work client-side.Cheers,
