but he current version of the Dictionary of Old English Corpus (0163) 
that we distribute is the 1998 version. It is P3 TEI SGML.  I believe 
the agreement is that we distribute the penultimate version.  We 
don't distribute the searching software.Our other Anglo-Saxon resources are as follows:0163: Complete corpus of Old English [Electronic resource] : 
  the Toronto Dictionary of Old English Corpus / compiled by 
  the University of Toronto Centre for Medieval Studies.(R)
0511: Cartularium Saxonicum : a collection of charters relating 
  to Anglo-Saxon history / by Walter de Gray Birch (F)
0813: King Alfred's version of St Augustine's Soliloquies (F)
0815: Alfred's Orosius (F)
1477: Helsinki corpus of English texts (R)
1936: Anglo-Saxon poetic records (F)
2425: The York-Helsinki parsed corpus of Old English poetry (R)
2462: The York-Toronto-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English prose (R)
2463: Ancrene Wisse Preface (R)With (F) indicating a text that is freely downloadable, and 
(R) indicating one that is restricted and so requires a printed 
form.Old and Middle English texts are one of the areas that we 
are quite interested in getting more complete coverage and 
more modern editions of texts.  Any electronic texts these areas 
that members of this list would like to deposit would be more 
than welcome.-James---
