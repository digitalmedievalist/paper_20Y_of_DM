would have to be re-scanned using special multi-spectral imaging
equipment. However, if the inks are different enough in colour and
tone, I'd think that you could build a process into regular image
processing software (such as Photoshop) that could differentiate
between the two inks. Not that I've ever done this myself.DotOn Mon, Jul 6, 2009 at 2:09 AM, <rwelzenb(a)umich.edu> wrote:
