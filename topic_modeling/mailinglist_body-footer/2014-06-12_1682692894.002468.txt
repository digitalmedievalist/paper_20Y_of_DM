(1913) on CD that I use for such purpose. Georges appartently has fewer entries (62.000 Hauptstichwörter, 200.000
Bedeutungsvarianten und rund 300.000 Belegstellen).  Where is your database
from? The wildcard ? (= single letter)  offered by Georges might be useful in
your search engine as well. Best, Udo Kindermann Dr Udo KindermannProfessor emerit. of Medieval LatinUniversity at Cologne50923 KölnGermany  Von: dm-l [mailto:dm-l-bounces(a)uleth.ca] Im Auftrag von Burghart Marjorie

Betreff: [dm-l] New resource: Enigma - Unpuzzling difficult Latin readings
in medieval manuscripts Dear list members,  Since I assume most of us work with Latin manuscripts at least sometimes, I
would like to share here the news of the release of my latest development,
called "Enigma" (Latin word for "puzzle"):http://ciham-digital.huma-num.fr/enigma/"Enigma helps scholars to decipher Latin words which are difficult to read
in medieval manuscripts. It is sometimes impossible to decipher all the
letters in a word, for various reasons (difficult palaeography, unclear
writing, damage to the document, etc.) If you type the letters you can read
and add wildcards, Enigma will list the possible Latin forms, drawing from
its database of more than 400 000 forms." I hpe you will find this useful :) Best regards, Marjorie Burghart
