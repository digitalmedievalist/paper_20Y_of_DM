prioritize one hierarchy over another where they overlap; if the conceptual 
structure is prioritized, the physical must be relegated to milestones.I think there is a long-term solution to this. I think multiple markups can 
exist on the same text, as long as they're in "different dimensions"; it's 
hard to explain, but imagine the text as a string going through space, and 
the markups as planes radiating out from it. Each markup would have to be 
keyed to positions in the text, rather than embedded directly in it, so 
instead of tags inside text you'd have tags which know which character 
position they belong in. Then you could combine two hierarchies in the 
manner which best suits your current purpose. For example, you might have a 
physical and a conceptual markup both keyed into the same text; either 
markup could be rendered as needed, and they could be combined using 
algorithms which generated well-formed output, prioritizing either one or 
the other, and reducing the second to milestones or divided tags linked by 
idrefs. In a system like this, each markup "dimension" would be much 
simpler and easier to manage. There are two major difficulties, though; one 
is that if the text itself is changed, all the markup pointers need to be 
updated to reflect the shift in character positions, and the other is that 
the combinatorial algorithms may need to be quite sophisticated, especially 
if more than two markup dimensions were to be rendered simultaneously.I'm sure someone must have thought of this before, though -- does anyone 
have references to proposals like this?Cheers,
