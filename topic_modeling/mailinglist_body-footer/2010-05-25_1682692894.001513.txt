recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) for encoding of
digital text. It combines in-depth coverage of the latest version of
the TEI Recommendations for the encoding of digital text with
practical workshops on related technologies. It includes an
introduction to mark-up, explanations of the TEI
Guidelines, and approaches to publishing TEI texts. Practical
exercises expose you hands-on experience of a wide range of TEI
customisation, editing, and publication.Each day will also include a number of afternoon 2.5 hour parallel
workshops on related technologies and topics. These will
include  TEI Publishing; TEI for Language Resources; Transforming TEI
with XSLT; TEI in Libraries; Creating a TEI-based Website with the
eXist XML Database; and Genetic Editing: transcribing documents,
transcribing the process.   There will also be optional surgery
sessions for those who wish to consult with TEI(a)Oxford about their
particular projects or encoding issues. There will also be guest
lectures from Digital Humanities experts familiar with the TEI talking
about their own projects.If you are a project manager, research assistant, or encoder working
on any kind of project concerned with the creation or
management of digital text, this course is for you.The course runs from Monday 12 July - Wednesday 14 July, 2010. The
