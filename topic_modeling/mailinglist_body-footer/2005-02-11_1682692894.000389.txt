Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI have installed some new software, but the problem predates that--and 
my spy and virus software is running and up-to-date. I have been 
wondering if that's maybe the issue, though if it is it seems to be 
buried deeper than spybot and norton can find. I've also backed up a 
couple of restore points, so my system should be operating as it was 
last week sometime.The reason I asked on the list was to see if there was a common issue I 
wasn't aware of before I start really ripping things apart to find the 
problem.The problem seems to manifesting itself in very interesting ways: 
firefox reads the directory the java is writing; ie and opera change the 
directory name to the expected form (with spaces). Since the two 
directories are out of sync, it means that files written by my java are 
now invisible to opera and ie.Thanks Peter. It is days (I hope) til I dumpt the whole windows thing 
and get with Linux. Well maybe weeks.-danPeter Baker wrote:
