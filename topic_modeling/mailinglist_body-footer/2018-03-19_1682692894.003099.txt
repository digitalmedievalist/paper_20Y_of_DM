=95=E2=80=95=E2=80=95=E2=80=95=E2=80=95=E2=80=95It is often said that the digital humanities are =E2=80=9Csituated at the
intersection of computer science and the humanities,=E2=80=9D but what does t=
his
mean? We believe that the point of using computers in the humanities is
not just to automatically analyze larger amounts of data or to
accelerate research. We therefore prefer to understand digital
humanities as (1) the study of means and methods of constructing formal
models in the humanities and (2) as the application of these means and
methods for the construction of concrete models in particular humanities
disciplines. The central research questions are thus correspondingly (1)
which computational methods are most appropriate for dealing with the
particular challenges posed by humanities research, e.g., uncertainty,
vagueness, incompleteness, but also with different positions (points of
view, values, criteria, perspectives, approaches, readings, etc.)? And
(2) how can such computational methods be applied to concrete research
questions in the humanities?The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers involved with
computational approaches in the humanities with the objective of
stimulating the research and exchange around innovative,
methodologically explicit approaches, to encourage discussion among
researchers and developers from different communities, and to help
bridging the divide that still exists between the different disciplines
involved in this field.The program will consist of invited and contributed talks on
computational methods for and in the humanities. The official language
of the workshop is English. Contributions can be submitted in English or
French.The workshop is organized by the Department of Language and Information
Sciences at the University of Lausanne, with the support of the Faculty
of Arts. The workshop underlines the commitment of the Department of
Language and Information Sciences to the computational dimension of the
digital humanities, including formal and mathematical methods.
Topics
=E2=95=90=E2=95=90=E2=95=90=E2=95=90=E2=95=90=E2=95=90  The topics of the workshop encompass formal and computational aspects
  related to the development and use of computational methods in the
  humanities (in particular the disciplines represented in the Faculty
  of Arts of UNIL - such as literature, linguistics, history, history of
  art, cinema studies, game studies).  Topics include, but are not limited to:  =E2=80=A2 Theoretical issues of formal modeling in the humanities
  =E2=80=A2 Knowledge representation in the humanities
  =E2=80=A2 Data structures addressing specific problems in the humanities
    (including text and markup)
  =E2=80=A2 Quantitative methods in the humanities
  =E2=80=A2 Computer vision and image analysis in the humanities
  =E2=80=A2 Spatial analysis in the humanities
  =E2=80=A2 Network analysis in the humanities
Submissions

=95=90=E2=95=90=E2=95=90  We invite researchers to submit abstracts of 500 to 1000 words (1=E2=80=932
  pages, excluding references). Abstracts will be reviewed double-blind
  by the members of the program committee, and all submissions will
  receive several independent reviews. Abstracts submitted at review
  stage must not contain the authors' names, affiliations, or any
  information that may disclose the authors' identity.  Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to present their
  research at the workshop as a talk, and the abstracts will be
  published in the book of abstracts of the workshop.  The abstracts must use the ACL 2017 format. Please strictly follow the
  guidelines that will be published on the workshop Web site. Abstracts
  must be submitted electronically in PDF format. For abstracts
  submissions we use EasyChair:
  [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcomhum2018]. For details
  please consult the workshop Web site at
  [http://www.unil.ch/llist/events/comhum2018].  Authors of accepted contributions will be invited, after the
  conference, to submit a full paper version (6=E2=80=9316 pages), which, aft=
er
  peer-review, will be published in an open-access, electronic
  conference volume endowed with persistent identifiers (to be confirmed
  soon).
