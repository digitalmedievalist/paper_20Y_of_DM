be working as normal.  Please do let us know if something is not
working properly!  Also note that I'll be doing some maintenance on
the machine this Saturday morning (GMT) and so that should be
considered an 'at risk' period if it disappears temporarily.Otherwise the website, journal, wiki, news-posting service, and such
should all be working properly.  Apologies again for this unscheduled
downtime.Dr James Cummings
Director, Digital Medievalist
