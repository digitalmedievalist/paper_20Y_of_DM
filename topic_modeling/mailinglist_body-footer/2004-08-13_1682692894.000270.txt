To: 	TEI-L(a)LISTSERV.BROWN.EDUHi Everyone,I used a mozilla program called Grava to encode images
of ancient documents, producing XML representations of
the strokes found in the images. This was software
originally developed to encode aerial satellite
imaging, and was constructed by Dr Paul Robertson,
formerly of the Robots Group, Dept of Engineering, Uni
of Oxford, now at CSAIL, MIT.  We have a paper
detailing this in the next edition of LLC:
Terras, M. and Robertson, P. (Forthcoming 2004).
"Downs and Acrosses, Textual Markup on a Stroke Based
Level".  Literary and Linguistic Computing, 19/3.Paul says that anyone can have a copy of the software
to play with, should they wish.Hope this helpsMelissa
