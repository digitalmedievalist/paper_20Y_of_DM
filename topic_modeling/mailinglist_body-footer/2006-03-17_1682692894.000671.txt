medievalists, to Sourceforge, the big Open Source software distribution 
service. Today I'm celebrating the 999th download from that site by 
releasing version 0.6.7, which fixes bugs and continues to chase after 
the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative specification. The new URL is 
http://junicode.sourceforge.net.If you have Junicode and have not updated your copy lately, I urge you 
to do so, for it continues to offer new features. Recent additions, for 
example, include characters in all styles for the transliteration of 
medieval Arabic and characters and OpenType features to support African 
languages. If you wish to keep up with releases (and I suggest you do, 
since releases include bug fixes and cosmetic improvements as well as 
new features), you can sign up at the Junicode website for the 
junicode-announce mailing list, which I promise will emit an e-mail 
*exclusively* when a new release is posted.Peter Baker--===============6625936553550828570==--
