al Medievalist Sponsored Session at the 54th International Congress on Mediev=
al Studies in Kalamazoo, May 9-12, 2019:Interdisciplinarity in Digital Medieval StudiesDigital methodologies and tools are commonly used among medievalists working =
in a variety of disciplines; less common, however, is the application of thes=
e methodologies and tools to cross-disciplinary scholarship. This session wil=
l consider 1) the role that digital projects play in reaching across discipli=
nary boundaries in medieval studies, 2) best practices for cross-disciplinary=
 digital and computational research, and 3) examples of the success and failu=
re of such research. For example, proposals may consider the use of stylometr=
ics in historical source criticism, the use of social network analysis in lit=
erary studies, or probe manuscript datasets for evidence in support of liturg=
ical, literary, historical, and art historical research. Our goal is to demon=
strate how the development and application of digital tools, methods, and for=
mats can enable and facilitate the interdisciplinary and collaborative resear=
ch of experts and specialists across their respective subdisciplines in order=
 to produce, provide, and openly share better insights and new knowledge with=
 scholars and the wider public alike.Please send abstracts (ca. 250 words) and the ICMS Participant Information Fo=
rm* to Lynn Ransom at lransom(a)upenn.edu<mailto:lransom(a)upenn.edu>. Deadli=
ne is September 15, 2018.*The ICMS Participant Information form will be available here in July: http:/=
