since I think the discipline required is extremely useful and
instructive. The counter argument might be, however, that "editing" is
important alongside facsimiles, but not necessarily digital editing, and
not necessarily complicated markup. While you probably would lose text
manipulation and selection based on specialised tags in an HTML edition,
for example, you'd retain searchability and core editorial features like
interpretation of data.I'm playing the devil's advocate obviously (and trying not to turn into
a troll!).> I also believe that looking at your texts from a markup perspective

one of the biggest reasons I find it useful. But when I make this
argument people who aren't already convinced seem less than impressed
often.Repurposability (if that's a word) is another strong argument. I often
think that may be the real "selling point": if you are going to
digitise, you may as well do it right so you can pump out your work in
various media and update it easily as needed.-d
