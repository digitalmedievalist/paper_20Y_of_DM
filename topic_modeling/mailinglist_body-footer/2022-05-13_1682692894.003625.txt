Manuscript Fragments and Fragmentology at the Library of Congress<http://www.=
medievalacademy.org/page/2023AnnualMeeting#ManuscriptFragments>
Session held on-side at the Library of CongressFriday, February 24, 2023With the aim of identifying and reconstructing broken books, the field of Fra=
gmentology has adopted digital tools and shared virtual workspaces. What data=
 do we gather and what stories do we tell with this emerging field of researc=
h? How are librarians, curators, collectors, historians, musicologists, textu=
al scholars, students, and digital humanists collaborating and producing new =
knowledge? How do these bits of books intersect with nationality and identity=
, and how do these constructs impact the scholarly work of identifying and re=
constructing manuscripts? This session will be hosted onsite at the Library o=
f Congress, and although it is not limited to any geographical scope, new res=
earch on DC-area collections of medieval manuscript fragments is especially w=
elcome.Organizers: Marianna Stell (Reference Librarian, Rare Book and Special Collec=
