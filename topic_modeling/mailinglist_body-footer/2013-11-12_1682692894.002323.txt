About DiXiT:DiXiT (Digital Scholarly Editions Initial Training Network) is an 
international network of high-profile institutions from the public and 
the private sector that are actively involved in the creation and 
publication of digital scholarly editions.DiXiT offers a coordinated training and research programme for early 
stage researchers and experienced researchers in the multi-disciplinary 
skills, technologies, theories, and methods of digital scholarly editing.DiXiT is funded under Marie Curie Actions within the European 
Commission's 7th Framework Programme and runs from September 2013 until

APPLICATIONAcademic Requirements:Early-Stage Researchers must be in the first 4 years of their research 
careers and not yet have a doctoral degree. This is measured from the 
date when they obtained the degree which would formally entitle them to 
embark on a doctorate, irrespective of whether or not a doctorate is 
envisaged.Experienced Researchers must be in possession of a doctoral degree or 
have at least 4 years of full-time equivalent research experience. At 
the time of recruitment by the host organisation an experienced 
researcher must also have less than 5 years of full-time equivalent 
research experience.It should be noted that an individual researcher may not be recruited 
first as an ESR and subsequently as an ER in the same project.
Marie Curie ITN mobility requirement:Researchers can be of any nationality. They are required to undertake 
trans-national mobility (i.e. move from one country to another) when 
taking up their appointment. One general rule applies to the appointment 
of researchers:At the time of recruitment by the host organisation, researchers must 
not have resided or carried out their main activity (work, studies, etc) 
in the country of their host organisation for more than 12 months in the 
3 years immediately prior to the reference date.Short stays such as holidays and/or compulsory national service are not 
taken into account.
Application process:Please note that applications from any qualified applicants, regardless 
of gender, ethnicity or country of origin are welcome if they meet the 
eligibility requirements.Applicants should send their applications directly to the institution 
hosting the desired fellowship. Applications for more than one post are 
welcome -- however, multiple applications should be indicated via the 
obligatory DiXiT application form (which has to be submitted separately 
from the application documents send to the hosting institution).
Application deadline:The deadline for applications is the 10th December 2013.
Please note that the four remaining ER fellowships will start at a later 
date and the possibility of application will be announced accordingly.
