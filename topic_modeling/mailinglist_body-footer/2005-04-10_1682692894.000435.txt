"Proposed Sessions for 2006," where those who plan on proposing sessions can
post the session title and a brief description. This can give us an idea of
the topics for next year, prior to the DM Business Meeting on Saturday.I've posted the RCH session, "Advanced Technology in Medieval Scholarship",
which is the same (general) session I've sponsored for the past three years.

Subject: [dm-l] Kalamazoo and Leeds Conference programmes on DM WikiThe Digital Medievalist List (see end of message for contact information and
project URLs).----------------------------------
Hello all,
	We are in the process of revamping the DM Wiki. As part of this, I 
thought it might be good to start an annual conference program for 
digital topics at Kalamazoo, Leeds, and elsewhere. I've started the 
Kalamazoo program, by listing the DM topics and the one talk in a 
general session that I know of. If you are giving a paper or organising 
a session at Kalamazoo this year, perhaps you might want to add a 
section for your session/paper. The format should be clear enough, and 
there is now a pretty complete help file. The URL for the Kalamazoo 2005 
page is <http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Kalamazoo_2005>.	I've also started a page for Leeds 2006, but have nothing other thanthe name there. If you are speaking or organising something at Leeds, 
you might want to add it to the Wiki at 
<http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Leeds_2005>Perhaps when the conference is over, speakers might want to link their 
abstracts, slides, or text to this page. The Spring 2006 issue of DM 
(submission deadline, December 31st, 2005) will feature papers from the 
Summer 2005 conference season.
	Finally, I've started pages for Kalamazoo and Leeds 2006: I thought 
perhaps we might be able to collaboratively work out paper topics using 
these pages, though I'm not sure that will work.<http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Leeds_2006>
