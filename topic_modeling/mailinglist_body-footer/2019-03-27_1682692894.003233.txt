tes) at the half-day workshop "Accelerating DH Education" taking place *Monda=
y 8th July from 9am to 1pm* at DH2019 in Utrecht.The workshop offers an exceptional platform for communication between DH prac=

ists. Among its organisers are people connected to several Dutch universities=
 and research institutions alongside nationwide initiatives SURF (the collabo=
rative ICT organisation for Dutch education and research) and the VSNU (the D=

ation, and to map and imagine its implications for accessible, inclusive and =
sustainable approaches to its delivery.=20(2) *Shared educational agendas and initiatives*. How can we move towards mor=
e cooperative and evidence-based approaches to teaching and training in DH ac=
ross the community? What are the key desiderata for educational innovation in=
 DH? This strand will feature both national agendas and international initiat=
ives including the #dariahTeach platform.We welcome 200-300 word proposals from anyone involved or interested in the c=
reation and usage of educational resources in DH.Submissions can be sent via the online submission form<https://docs.google.co=
