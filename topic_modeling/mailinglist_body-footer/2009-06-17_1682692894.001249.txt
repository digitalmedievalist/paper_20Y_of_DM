*Linking and Querying Ancient Texts: A multi-database case study with
epigraphic corpora*ALL WELCOMELaQuAT (a JISC-Engage projct conducted in collaboration with OGSA-DAI at
the Edinburgh Parallel Processing Centre) investigates technologies for
providing integrated views across heterogeneous ancient documentary text
collections, including relational databases with different schemas and
an XML corpus. These structurally diverse datasets overlap
geographically, chronologically, and prosopographically, and so a
mechanism for querying an integrated set of them is of considerable
potential value to the researcher.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk,
Simon.Mahony(a)kcl.ac.uk, Stuart.Dunn(a)kcl.ac.uk or Juan.Garces(a)bl.uk, or

presentation slides will be uploaded a few days after the seminar. All
