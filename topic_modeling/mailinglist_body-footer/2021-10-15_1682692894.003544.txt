manities in Ireland and the UK22 October 2021, 09:30-15:30
Please register for a place at the virtual event:
https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/who-has-access-to-digital-humanities-tickets-1=
68119970357
The convenors of an Arts and Humanities Research Council/Irish Research Counc=
il funded project to undertake research and consultation towards the implemen=
tation of a permanent Digital Humanities association for the UK and Ireland (=
see list of team members at https://dhnetwork.org/) invite submissions from i=
ndividuals to co-create an event relating to DH and inclusion.
One of the dreams of information and communication technologies is that of eq=
uitable and open access to information, to services, and to opportunities. We=
 know, of course, that this is only true on the surface, and that technologic=
al systems tend to recreate the inequities of the cultures and societies that=
 build them. As such, the dream of the digital humanities as a =E2=80=98big t=
ent' (that is, capacious, broad and inclusive) is also one that we ne=
ed to constantly query and challenge if the field is to have a claim to being=
 inclusive and diverse.
This is a particularly pressing issue as we explore the potential for a regio=
nal DH network to support the use and promotion of DH methods in the UK and I=
reland.
