*The Application of Photogrammetric 3D Modeling to Roman Domestic Space*
Kelly McClinton (Bloomington IN)Digital photogrammetry is well-suited to the illustration of Roman wall paint=
ings. Unlike traditional photography, photogrammetry can offer three-dimensio=
nal documentation that captures features in the structure of the wall. It can=
 also preserve the orientation of multiple walls in situ. This seminar will d=
iscuss the results of a photogrammetric campaign recently undertaken in the H=
ouse of Marcus Lucretius at Pompeii. In the process, it will explore the use =
of 3D models to represent complex relationships between spaces and objects. T=
o conclude, future avenues for research will be discussed, including the crea=
tion of a database to visualize connections within the material record.Seminar livestreamed and archived at: https://youtu.be/IlS_SY_lbUoFull programme: http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/wip2018.htmlALL WELCOME
