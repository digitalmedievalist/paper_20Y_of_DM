ould like to share here the news of the release of my latest development, cal=
led "Enigma" (Latin word for "puzzle"):=20
http://ciham-digital.huma-num.fr/enigma/=20
"Enigma helps scholars to decipher Latin words which are difficult to read in=
 medieval manuscripts. It is sometimes impossible to decipher all the letters=
 in a word, for various reasons (difficult palaeography, unclear writing, dam=
age to the document, etc.) If you type the letters you can read and add wildc=
ards, Enigma will list the possible Latin forms, drawing from its database of=
 more than 400 000 forms."=20I hpe you will find this useful :)=20
Best regards,=20
