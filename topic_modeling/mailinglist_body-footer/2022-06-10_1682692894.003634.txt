or the 22th annual Conference and Members' Meeting of the Text Encodi=
ng Initiative Consortium (TEI), which will be held 13-16 September 2022 (Tue-=
Fri) at Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom with pre-co=
nference workshops 12-13 September 2022 (Mon-Tue).https://conferences.ncl.ac.uk/tei2022/This year's theme is:  Text as dataThe past decade has seen a huge increase of data produced by (social)media pl=
atforms, digital literary outputs, and various mass digitization efforts of c=
ultural heritage and administrative records. Though these vast data collectio=
ns hold enormous potential for diverse research, collecting and analyzing tex=
t-based data also presents unique challenges that need to be addressed. The i=
ncreasing quantity of the textual data coincides with its improved availabili=
ty and accessibility, but also the continuously progressing development of da=
ta models, tools, text-mining, and machine-learning techniques. The TEI commu=
nity is working at the intersection of many of these areas.If we want the computer to =E2=80=9Cunderstand=E2=80=9D a text we must either=
 mark textual phenomena or instruct a computer to identify them. In their acc=
laimed work =E2=80=9CThe Shape of Data in the Digital Humanities=E2=80=9D fro=
m 2018, Julia Flanders and Fotis Jannidis refer to this as =E2=80=9Ca choice =
between an algorithmic approach [=E2=80=A6] or what we might call a =E2=80=9C=
metatextual=E2=80=9D approach, in which information is added to the text in s=
ome explicit form that enables it to be processed intelligently=E2=80=9D.This call invites contributions dealing with text-related tasks in all aspect=
s of the research process: discovery, analysis, representation, visualization=
, prediction, causal inference, etc.Possible topics related to this theme include:  *   TEI for analysis, annotation or visualization
  *   TEI and machine learning, data science, or text mining
  *   TEI and literary analysis
  *   TEI and linked open data
  *   TEI and complex data structures
  *   TEI and computer-mediated communication or social media
  *   TEI and computer vision or handwritten text recognition
  *   TEI and formal ontologies or stand-off annotation
  *   TEI and models of text
  *   TEI and galleries/libraries/archives/museumsbut submissions in other areas are also welcome.Submission InformationEach submission should include a title, an abstract, up to five keywords, and=
 a brief biography for each of the authors. (Each biography should be no more=
 than 500 characters, and should include current affiliation, research intere=
sts, and projects).The following word counts apply to the text of the abstract excluding titles,=
 bibliography, keywords, and biographies.LanguageThe proposals must be submitted in English. The conference language is Englis=
h.Submission Procedure  *   Proposals must be submitted online via ConfTool: https://www.conftool.p=
ro/tei2022/. You will need a (free) account to submit a proposal.
  *   The deadline for submissions is 20 June 2022 by 23:59 HAST.
  *   All proposals will be peer-reviewed by the Program Committee.
  *   Notifications of acceptance will be sent out by 25 July 2022.
  *   The deadline for submissions of the final abstracts is 22 August 2022.
  *   Final abstracts have to be in DOCX or ODT format.
  *   For further information please contact the local organizers at tei2022(=
