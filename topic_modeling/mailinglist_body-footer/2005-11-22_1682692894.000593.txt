This is very useful indeed, and yes, I did have a look at eXist, but not
sure I'd be prepared to use this software for the project without
specific technical support.
 
However, I should have perhaps explained that after numerous discussions
with colleagues, trials and advice from our computing centre here in
Leicester, the decision was taken to catalogue our manuscripts creating
a data-capture database. We need to be able to publish our data soon,
ideally June 2006, it is not  a single publication at the end of the
project. We are relying on our computer centre, which suggested managing
our data from Microsoft Access on my desk machine, but then publish it
for Web access on the university SQL server. I am some how hesitant
about using  Access as it does not seem to have any flexibility in
exporting the data, a part from SQL and XML. FileMaker Pro 8 seems to
have more flexibility at this hand exporting in PDF, SQL, XML and excel.
A similar method was used by the PASE project, I think.I am digressing here, anyway, we would still want to export the data in
XML and clearly there are standards which may not be ignored. Thus my
question relating to a possible correlation between TEI and relational
databases. I look forward to the West Midland Catalogue. All the best,Orietta

Subject: [dm-l] re: Relational database and TEI
In fact, this is not quite what Scriptorium does.  Scriptorium was
actually originally built as a relational database, using Access indeed,
and I believe that this is still what it is, at base.  The Scriptorium
people were indeed heavily involved in the drafting of the XML
manuscript descriptoin guidelines which first became the MASTER system,
and now underlie the TEI guidelines.  It was one of their aims to be
able to export data from their database into Master/TEI XML, and
possibly to import from Master/TEI into the database, but I am not sure
how far they got with this. In any case, one should distinguish their
arrangement from that now used by quite a few database systems now
available (mostly proprietary and very very expensive), which can read
XML schemas, configure a database accordingly, and then automatically
import data direct from the XML into the database.
One such system, which seems very powerful, is free, and has been used
with some success by some people at least, is eXist
(http://exist.sourceforge.net/): very powerful, very configurable.  I
don't know of an implementation of EXIST for Master/TEI encoded
manuscript descriptions but this would surely be possible.  One system
which was built specifically for MASTER records was the PHELIX system,
built at Oxford for the MASTER project.  This had some very neat
features indeed -- where is it now?
And, of course, I have to mention the Anastasia implementations of
XML-encoded manuscript descriptions.  The original MASTER catalogue is
not now functioning.  But there is a quite wonderful early print book
(not manuscript! -- but the encodings work just fine, it seems) database
of books printed in or about Japan c.1550-1650 at
http://133.12.23.145:8080/html/.  This features, among many amazing
things, some very clever cross-language searching -- choose 'place name'
in the search menu and look for 'Kyoto' and it will find you Kyoto in
Japanese! It also has many images, and lots of other fine things.
If you are looking for an XML online catalogue of manuscripts: Wendy
Scase's West Midland Manuscripts project is also  coming your way,
again, done with Anastasia.  This is
http://www.sd-editions.com/AnaServer?MWM+0+start.anv.  This website is
currently being updated and should look much nicer in a few days.  But
what is here, gives some idea of what can be doneall the best

***original messageDear all, Does anybody know about electronic manuscript projects which are
using/have used relational databases following the TEI guidelines for
'Manuscript description'?Scriptorium seems to have done it, any other similar project? If so, do
you know of any related publication?I'd be very grateful for any advice, pitfall etc.Best wishes, OriettaDr Orietta Da Rold
