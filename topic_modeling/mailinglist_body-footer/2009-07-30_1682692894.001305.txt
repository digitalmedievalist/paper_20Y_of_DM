Subject: [MEDTEXTL] beyond besic codicology
To: MEDTEXTL(a)listserv.illinois.edu
I am working on the section of the Any Holt Library which will be
similar to what I have done with incunabula. This will be for medieval
manuscripts. The first page will feature how scholars deal with
manuscripts: paleography and codicology, pecia and other procedures in
medieval scriptoria. I am interested in recent scientific
developments: techniques for identifying and examining a palimpsest,
what DNA analysis id doing for manuscript study. Where do I go to find
online material for these? I will include a page on catalogs and
cataloging projects, and I will include the work I have already done
withCONSULTING MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS
