Angelsachsen of Felix Liebermann16-17 July, 2008The Institute for Historical Research, LondonPapers are being sought for a two-day conference commemorating the
one-hundredth anniversary of the publication of Felix Liebermann's
seminal edition of the Old English laws, Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen.
 The conference will be held 16-17 July, 2008, at the Institute for
Historical Research in London.  Proposals of around 300 words are
invited on the areas of Historiography (especially, but not
exclusively, relating to Liebermann), Evidence (manuscripts and
archeological data), Philology, Law, and Editing. Within each of these
areas, we invite proposals that consider antiquarian interest in early
laws, general historiography on the laws to the present, assessments
of Liebermann's accomplishment, the problems with his edition, new
editing work, discovery of new manuscripts or reinterpretations of
known manuscripts, construction and use of individual manuscripts,
legal terminology (Old English, Latin, or early Anglo-Norman),
considerations of individual laws, codes in context, and comparative
work on England and its neighbors.All sessions will be plenary, and the organizers invite proposals for
panels as well as for individual papers.  The conference is being
organized by Stefan Jurasinski (SUNY-Brockport), Bruce O'Brien (Mary
Washington), Lisi Oliver (LSU), and Andrew Rabin (University of
Louisville).  Proposals should be sent to Bruce O'Brien at the
Institute of Historical Research by 31 October 2007 (email:
bobrien(a)umw.edu).  The full CFP may be found at
