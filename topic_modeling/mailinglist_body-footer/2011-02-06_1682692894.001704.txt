command-line utility called "fontswith," which searches the fonts on a 
system for one or more glyphs and reports which ones the system has, e.g.me> fontswith Amacron
me> fontswith U+FB01 eacuteA search can take a minute or so, but fontswith can also build an index 
so that searches can usually be done in about a second. You need Python 
2.3 or higher and a reasonably recent build of FontForge (with its 
Python extensions). It's here:http://faculty.virginia.edu/OldEnglish/fontswith/A reasonably decent little utility for Linux.PeterOn 2/6/11 4:18 PM, Simpson, Grant Leyton wrote:
