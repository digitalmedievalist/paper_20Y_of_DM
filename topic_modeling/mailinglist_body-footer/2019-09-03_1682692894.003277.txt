March 26-27, 2020
Michigan State University

Deadline: November 1
Proposal form <http://www.msuglobaldh.org/submit-a-proposal/>Digital Humanities at Michigan State University is proud to extend its
symposium series on Global DH into its fifth year, on March 26-27, 2020.
Digital humanities scholarship continues to be driven by work at the
intersections of a range of distinct disciplines and an ethical commitment
to preserve and broaden access to cultural materials. In celebration of the
10th anniversary of MSU's Cultural Heritage Informatics Program
<http://chi.anthropology.msu.edu/>, we particularly encourage proposals
along that theme, but as always we strive to showcase DH work in all its
forms.Alongside the expansion of digital humanities in under-resourced and
underrepresented areas, a number of complex issues surface, including,
among others, questions of ownership, cultural theft, virtual exploitation,
digital rights, endangered data, and the digital divide. DH communities
have raised and responded to these issues, pushing the field forward. This
symposium is an opportunity to broaden the conversation about these issues.
Scholarship that works across borders with foci on transnational
partnerships and globally accessible data is especially welcome.
Additionally, we define the term =E2=80=9Chumanities=E2=80=9D rather broadly =
to incorporate
the discussion of issues that encourage interdisciplinary understanding of
the humanities.Focused on these issues of social justice, we invite work at the
intersections of critical DH; race and ethnicity; feminism,
intersectionality, and gender; and anti-colonial and postcolonial
frameworks to participate.This symposium, which will include a mixture of presentation types,
welcomes 300-word proposals related to any of these issues, and
particularly on the following themes and topics by *Friday, November 1,
midnight in your timezone*:   - Critical cultural studies and analytics

   - DH as socially engaged humanities and/or as a social movement
   - Open data, open access, and data preservation as resistance,
   especially in a postcolonial context
