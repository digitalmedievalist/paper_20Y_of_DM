election of the Digital Medievalist Executive Board. Per the Digital
Medievalist Bylaws, Board members will be expected to serve the DM
membership by serving on an editorial committee responsible for the

moderating the dm-l listserv, and/or organizing conference and poster
sessions on behalf of Digital Medievalist. Board members serve
two-year terms.For more information on the Digital Medievalist and the DM Board,

is Lady Day, the Feast of the Annunciation, and was New Year's Day
until 1752, when western dating moved from the Julian Calendar to the
Gregorian Calendar. It is thus a suitable day to welcome the new
Digital Medievalist board members.Everyone subscribed to the Digital Medievalist Listserv is eligible to
vote. Watch for an announcement with details on how to cast your vote
on March 20.Nominee biographies are also posted at

*************************************
Abdullah Alger:My name is Abdullah Alger and I am currently finishing my PhD thesis
at the University of Manchester which examines the verbal parallels
and punctuation of the poems in the Exeter Book.  I have been
interested in the use of IT and literary studies since my
undergraduate degree at Washington State University where I graduated
with a B.A. in English focusing on rhetoric and composition. At the
moment, I am particularly interested in the use and abuse of
manuscript digitization projects, as well as future trends in the
field which might include the merging of text, image and concordance
applications.  Furthermore, I am also interested in formulaic theory,
which explains my interest in concordances, but concerned with the
extension of the theory's basic tenets to analyze and theorize
hypertexts.  Much of my interests lie in the development of
information technology to help explain Anglo-Saxon textual culture,
which I hope to develop further to include the early modern period, or
the English Renaissance.-------------------------------------
Arianna Ciula:Dr. Arianna Ciula is Research Associate at Centre for Computing in the
Humanities, King's College London.She teaches a postgraduate course on Material Culture (Medieval
manuscripts) in the MA of Digital Humanities and, in general, has been
lecturing within undergraduates and postgraduate programmes on
humanities computing and primary sources at the University of
Siena-Arezzo. She is a member of various international digital
communities (e.g. ALLC and ACH associations, Digital Medievalist,
Digital Classicist) and has been an elected member of the TEI
Technical Council for the term 2007-2009.She has collaborated to the organization of two conferences on issues
related to humanities computing (DIGIMED - Digital Philology and
Medieval Texts; CLiP - Computers, Literature and Philology). She
graduated with BA (Hons) in Communication sciences (University of
Siena, Italy) in 2001 and received an MA in Applied Computing in the
Humanities (King's College London) in 2004. She completed her Ph.D. in
Manuscript and Book Studies at the University of Siena in 2005. Her
research interests focus, in general, on the debate and creation of
digital resources related to primary sources. More specifically, she
is interested in the integration of medieval palaeography and
humanities computing, image-based research and textual technologies.-------------------------------------
Dan O'DonnellDaniel Paul O'Donnell is the current director of the Digital
Medievalist project and was the Principal Investigator on its initial
SSHRC grant. He is currently also Chair of the Text Encoding
Initiative and the Department of English at the University of
Lethbridge. He publishes primarily in Anglo-Saxon studies and Digital
Humanities. His digital-and-print edition of the earliest known
English poem, CÃ¦dmon's Hymn, was published by D.S. Brewer in 2005. He
also writes a regular column on Humanities Computing for Heroic Age.-------------------------------------
Peter Robinson:Peter Robinson is Co-Director of the Institute for Textual Scholarship
and Electronic Editing at the University of Birmingham, UK.  He is
developer of the textual-editing program Collate, used by many textual
editing projects worldwide, and of the Anastasia electronic publishing
system.  He is director of the Canterbury Tales Project, and was
editor of its first major electronic publication, The Wife of Bath's
Prologue on CD-ROM (Cambridge UP, 1996.)  He acts as consultant on
electronic publishing to many scholarly groups, and particularly
Cambridge University Press.  He has published and lectured on matters
relating to computing and textual editing, on text encoding,
digitization, and electronic publishing, and on Geoffrey Chaucer's The
Canterbury Tales.  He is active in the development of standards for
digital resources, as a past board member of the Text Encoding
Initiative and as leader of the EU funded MASTER project.  In 2000, he
founded a new electronic publishing house, Scholarly Digital Editions,
specializing in high-quality electronic publications.  He has been
active in Digital Medievalist almost since its inception: attending
various panels, contributing to DM discussions, and writing an article
for the first DM journal, and looks forward to the opportunity to
serve the DM community as a board member.-------------------------------------
Torsten Schassan:I am accepting this nomination for the DM board as I want to support
this initiative which I think is very useful and needed to bring
together people and offer a platform for resources.My main fields of interest are digital editions as well as
digitization and publication of medieval manuscripts. In a more
general view I am interested in markup languages, the theory of
representation of information, in database and GUI design.Currently I am preparing a digital edition of a medieval palimpsest
manuscript at the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenbuettel. Here,
before that, I have been responsible for the adoption of TEI-P5 for
the German medieval manuscript cataloguing system. I am part of the
project team of the projects CESG and e-codices.ch, responsible for
metadata and server administration.My educational background includes a M.A. in medieval and modern
History, German literature and language and Philosophy, received at
the University at Cologne, as well as teaching experience at the
Computer Science for the Humanities (professorship) at the University
at Cologne.
