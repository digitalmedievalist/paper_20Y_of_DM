http://heldig.fi/dhh20We regret to inform that #DHH20 is postponed until 2021, and thus will
be organized under the name #DHH21. The decision was made due to
restrictions in contact teaching and general guidelines at the
University of Helsinki during these challenging times. The new dates in
May-June 2021 and other information about #DHH21 will be announced later
next year.For more information on what the hackathon was like in previous years,
see: http://heldig.fi/dhhIf you are a student and will need the credits for the DHH Hackathon
this year (e.g. to complete the the Digital Humanities minor study
block), please contact Mikko Tolonen (mikko.tolonen(a)helsinki.fi).Regards,
#DHH General organizers
