s,
so aggregating them is no different from aggregating bits of blogs or any oth=
er
RSS/atom feed.I read a whole bunch of blogs and news feeds (using google reader in my case
http://www.google.com/reader) regularly, and would be happy to know of any mo=
re
related to humanities computing and digital medievalism if people have sugges=
tions.I would echo Paul's dislike of digested messages.  If I want to read the other
mailing lists then I'll subscribe to them.However, I have no objection to DM-L being a subscriber to a few very
low-traffic and related announcement lists, like the junicode-announce one, b=

only where it is something specific to DM's mission.  (I.e. although many of =

may also use linux, subscribing DM-L to a particular linux distribution's
