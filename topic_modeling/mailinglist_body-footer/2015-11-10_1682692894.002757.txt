Institute of Historical Research training room
Senate House, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HUThere are a few places left on a training workshop for postgraduate students =

e principles behind 3D imaging, modelling and representation of terrain and e=
levation, and how these can be used in research as well as visualisation. It =
