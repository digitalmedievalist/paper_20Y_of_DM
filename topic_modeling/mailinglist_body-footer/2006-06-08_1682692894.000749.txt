process, consisting a.o. of defining selection criteria, defining the 
spelling of an entry (in historical dictionaries), etc. And it is 
usually based on a corpus of texts, sometimes compiled by the 
lexicographers themselves.It has been tested in court. Someone had published a cd with a rhyming 
dictionary and had used the list of lemmata of the Van Dale dictionary 
of Dutch. Van Dale won the law suit. It was about 10, maybe 15 years ago.KatrienGabriel BODARD wrote:
