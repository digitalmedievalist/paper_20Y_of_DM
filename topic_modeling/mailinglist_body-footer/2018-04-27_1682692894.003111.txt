ly annotate potentially ambiguous critical apparatus entries in critical text=
 editions. Samewords I call it.Some potential users may be kept from trying using it, as it requires you to =
run it through Python on the computer.So I have created an online web service.
There is a UI version available here: http://samewords.stenskjaer.net/.
Upload your edition file, wait a couple of seconds and get back the annotated=
 version.For the more technically minded there is also a RESTful API endpoint that can=
 be used to call the script on any file with a publicly reachable URL. A bit =
of documentation about how to use that can be found here: https://samewords.r=
eadthedocs.io/en/latest/api.htmlI hope this will make it easy for anyone to use the script in creation of the=
ir critical editions in LaTeX.Any feedback is of course very welcome.Enjoy the weekend,
Michael
