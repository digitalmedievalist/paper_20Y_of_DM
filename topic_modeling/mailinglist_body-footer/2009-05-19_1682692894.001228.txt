Please crosspost to other lists as appropriateCall For NomineesDigital Medievalist will be holding elections at the end of this month

terms and incumbents may be re-elected. Members of the board are
responsible for the over all direction of the organisation and leading
the Digital Medievalist's many projects and programmes. This is a
working board and if you are willing and able to commit time to
helping Digital Medievalist undertake some of its activities
(such as hands on copy-editing of its journal) then please take
this into consideration when nominating yourself or accepting a
nomination.Information about Digital Medievalist is available at its website.

subscription to the organisation's mailing list, dm-l(a)uleth.ca) and

digital medieval studies.If you are interested in running for these positions or are able to
recommend a suitable candidate, please contact the returning officers:
James Cummings and Roberto Rosselli Del Turco at:election(a)digitalmedievalist.orgwho will treat your nomination in confidence. The nomination period
