have been abridged (censored?) for Kindle or Nook. Worth

Subject: Re: [dm-l] TAN: How does one reference a location in an electronic  =
   book on Kindle or iPad?Perhaps this occurs only in journals of literary scholarship -- but if I
cite a recent reprint of a book or article, almost inevitably the editor
or the readers insist that I go back to the original edition and make it
the basis of my citations. I have always thought this was silly, as the
more recent reprint may be the only available form in which most people
can read the article -- but perhaps in the case of a Kindle edition,
when it is actually an older print edition, one should seek out the
original IF ONE CAN FIND OUT.  I recently looked at a Kindle version of
a translation of Aristophanes "The Knights", which Amazon advertised as
"new".  It was almost certainly not new, but there was no way at all of
finding out where or when the print version had been done, or even who
translated it. Amazon is doing no one a fvor with this kind of policy.
