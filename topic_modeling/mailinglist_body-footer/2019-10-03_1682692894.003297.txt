Best,Kristen*Global Digital Humanities Symposium*March 26-27, 2020Michigan State Universitymsuglobaldh.org*Call for Proposals*Deadline: November 1Proposal form <http://www.msuglobaldh.org/submit-a-proposal/>Digital Humanities at Michigan State University is proud to extend its
symposium series on Global DH (msuglobaldh.org <http://www.msuglobaldh.org/>)
into its fifth year, on *March 26-27, 2020*. Digital humanities scholarship
continues to be driven by work at the intersections of a range of distinct
disciplines and an ethical commitment to preserve and broaden access to
cultural materials. In celebration of the 10th anniversary of MSU's Cultural
Heritage Informatics Program <http://chi.anthropology.msu.edu/>, we
particularly encourage proposals along that theme, but as always we strive
to showcase DH work in all its forms.Alongside the expansion of digital humanities in under-resourced and
underrepresented areas, a number of complex issues surface, including,
among others, questions of ownership, cultural theft, virtual exploitation,
digital rights, endangered data <http://endangereddataweek.org/>, and the
digital divide. DH communities have raised and responded to these issues,
pushing the field forward. This symposium is an opportunity to broaden the
conversation about these issues. Scholarship that works across borders with
foci on transnational partnerships and globally accessible data is
especially welcome. Additionally, we define the term “humanities” rather
broadly to incorporate the discussion of issues that encourage
interdisciplinary understanding of the
humanities.Focused on these issues of social justice, we invite work at the
intersections of critical DH; race and ethnicity; feminism,
intersectionality, and gender; and anti-colonial and postcolonial
frameworks to participate.This symposium, which will include a mixture of presentation types,
welcomes 300-word proposals related to any of these issues, and
particularly on the following themes and topics by *Friday, November 1,
midnight in your timezone:*   - Critical cultural studies and analytics
   - Cultural heritage in a range of contexts, particularly non-Western
   - DH as socially engaged humanities and/or as a social movement
   - Open data, open access, and data preservation as resistance,
   especially in a postcolonial context

   humanities work
   - Global research dialogues and collaborations within the digital
   humanities community
   - Indigeneity – anywhere in the world – and the digital

   - Global digital pedagogies
