d we are seeking proposals for 5 minute lightning talks to be posted to YouTu=
be as part of the event.Symposium page: https://www.library.upenn.edu/event/translating-science
Lightning talk submission form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfnG=
sFm_CZy4usTyM-Ch2nKJw7XY_VKTromYWXaYF-LIrKI8Q/viewformTranslating Science considers the networks of exchange, transmission, and tra=
nslation of natural knowledge evident in manuscript culture in the pre- and e=
arly modern periods. We will examine in particular the role of the manuscript=
 book in the translation of natural knowledge across linguistic, regional, di=
sciplinary, and epistemic boundaries. How did scholars, physicians, or philos=
ophers use glosses, diagrams, or other elements of mise-en-page to convey inf=
ormation? What does the manuscript record reveal about the diffusion and cons=
ervation of knowledge? How does the materiality of the book itself drive the =
movement and development of scientific knowledge? What was the role of the sc=
ientific manuscript in the era of printed books?The deadline for submitting proposals for a lightning talk is Friday, October=
 14.Applicants will be notified by October 21Videos must be submitted to SIMS by November 7Proposals should be relevant to the theme of TRANSLATING SCIENCE and must be =
5 minutes long or shorter.If you're curious about the lightning talk format you can see the Lightning T=
