'Towards the Digital Squeeze: 3-D imaging of inscriptions and curse tablets'ALL WELCOMECreating records of inscriptions often serves multiple purposes, such as
aiding interpretation, preservation, or dissemination. Traditionally,
squeezes, sketches, and photographs have been the methods by which these
representations have been made. This talk will explore the possibilities
for epigraphic study offered by non-contact 3D digitization, which
enables the ability to capture, distribute, and visualize the full
geometric properties of an inscription.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk or
