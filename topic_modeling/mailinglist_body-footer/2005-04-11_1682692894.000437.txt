	Some members of the list asked me over the weekend to announce a policy 
about posting replies to the list. The issue comes when one
indiscriminately copies the entire message to which one is replying.
After a couple of iterations, this produces very long messages with very
little new content. The length of these messages increases expense for
customers using wireless or dial up service.	Better practice is to copy only fragments of text to which one is 
replying, or, if one is replying more generally, summarising the gist of 
the earlier posting. What we certainly should be avoiding are messages 
that end with a long appendix of quoted material from the thread.	I'm a terrible offender myself, I know, and not all mailers will let 
you eliminate the copied text (my PDA doesn't seem to allow that for 
example). But most mail clients do.	Thanks.-DanP.S. To do my bit, I've eliminated that annoying "DM-L" header that 
prefixed every message... the source of the other complaint this weekend. ;)
