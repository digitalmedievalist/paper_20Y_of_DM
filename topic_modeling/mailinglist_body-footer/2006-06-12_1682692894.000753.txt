since only the original "Draft Recommendations for TEI Digital
Facsimiles" document isn't up to date (read this as: this page can be
useful right NOW! :) ;2. this is also relevant for people interested in transcription, should
be mentioned on the transcription SIG ml (will do that myself later...).Since the purpose of SVG is quite alien to our purposes, I fully agree
with the "[looking at] ways that TEI repeats functionality in SVG and
suggests ways that TEI might incorporate elements from the SVG
namespace rather than using different elements in the TEI namespace"
part. Will follow these pages with interest.Ciao-- Roberto Rosselli Del Turco      roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
