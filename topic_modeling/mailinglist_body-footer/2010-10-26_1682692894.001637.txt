Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitDot et al.,at this year's RSA conference in Venice, Todd Rester --- who not only
knows much about photography, but has a passion for it --- gave a paper:TODD M. RESTER, CALVIN THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY A Digital Researcher's
Toolkit: Sive, Ad Fontes, Renatos ac Digitaliter AcquisitosThe paper was accompanied by slides and detailed description on how to
assemble a light field kit for making digital photos, complete with a
stand and a connection to computer (you control the camera from the
computer).  Later, Todd shared the slides with me, which I can pass on to
those interested.We used Todd's recipes to put together a similar kit and photograph a
three-volume Bible in the field (a Franciscan monastery).  I can tell you
that nothing can beat sunlight, and that getting the values of exposure
and film sensitivity just right is an art. In the end we just stuck to
defaults, and got quite acceptable results.  But having a direct
connection to the computer was very practical.Yours,Neven
