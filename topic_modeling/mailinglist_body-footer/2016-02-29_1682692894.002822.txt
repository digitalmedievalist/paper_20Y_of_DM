=9D based =20
at Hamburg are very pleased to announce the publication of the second =20
issue of the Early Islamic Empire Working Paper Series. =E2=80=9CJedli: A =20
Textual Analysis Toolbox for Digitized Arabic Texts=E2=80=9D by Jos=C3=A9 Har=
o =20
Peralta and Peter Verkinderen is now available for download at =20
https://www.islamic-empire.uni-hamburg.de/en/publications-tools/publications/=
working-paper-series.html. The working paper contains a detailed manual of ho=
w to use Jedli, a toolbox developed by the two authors to help scholars make =
use of digitized Arabic texts more quickly and =20
efficiently.Scholars working with Arabic texts are often confronted with an =20
extraordinary number of sources at their disposal. Manually =20
researching these texts can take an inordinate amount of time. =20
Although many of the primary sources in Arabic have been available in =20
digital form for some time now, the potential inherent in this =20
development has not been fully realized yet. Inspired by the advent of =20
digital humanities, the project team have started developing a number =20
of tools for text mining and data analysis that more fully take =20
advantage of the digitization of Arabic sources.Jedli is a toolbox that currently contains three distinct search =20
functions: the indexer, the highlighter, and the context search. The =20
indexer enables you to produce a custom index of any word in a text =20
(or any number of words in any number of texts at the same time), =20
complete with references to the specific volume and page number of =20
each occurrence, and a user-defined amount of context around the =20
search word. The highlighter marks any number of search terms in =20
different colors according to a user-defined color scheme, to help you =20
identify relevant text segments more quickly. The context search =20
allows you to restrict search results to contexts pertinent to your =20
research through the combination of customized (lists of) search terms.The current version of Jedli can now be downloaded for free from our =20
website at =20
https://www.islamic-empire.uni-hamburg.de/en/publications-tools/digital-tools=
/jedli.html. We also provide a directory containing a collection of digitized=
 Arabic texts that we have already converted into the format required for Jed=
li to work =20
(.txt).The current version only runs on Windows platforms, but we are working =20
to ensure that it will run on other operating systems in the near =20
future as well. If you encounter any bugs or problems during the =20
execution of the program, or have requests for additional features, =20
please let us know by e-mailing us at joseharoperalta(a)gmail.com and/or =20
