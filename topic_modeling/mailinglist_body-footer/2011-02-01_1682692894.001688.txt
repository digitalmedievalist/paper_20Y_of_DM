 to an extent on one's previous experience and knowledge.But even then, I would be hard-pressed to see how XSLT would be better than P=
erl or a similar language when it comes to processing data in which which are=
 not essentially to do with formatting XML documents for display.If I wanted to, say, develop a program to lemmatise text marked up in paragra=
phs <p>, or parse Roman calendar dates marked up with <date>, is that somethi=
ng for which you would recommend using XSLT? XSLT would easily let you find t=
hat data, but I am not sure it would be easy to then process it in XSLT. Not =
having associative arrays or more complex data structures in XSLT makes that =
particularly hard, not?Godfried-----Original Message-----
