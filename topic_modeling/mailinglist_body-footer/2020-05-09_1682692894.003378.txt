Good morning,
I'm Elisabetta Corsi, student enrolled in the third year of the Degree Course=
 in Literary and Philosophical Studies (Classical Literature) at the Universi=
ty of Siena.In the second part of my thesis, I intend to develop a commentary on the Cano=
n for the Rest of the Dead of the Byzantine Poetess Kassia (9th century). In =
particular, I would like to highlight the references to Sacred Scripture and =
Patristics that could be found in the Canon. In an attempt to pursue as much =
precision as possible within the work, I would like to carry out an intertext=
ual research (through the most relevant lemmas and locutions of the hymn), in=
 order to make clear the relationship that the poetess establishes - consciou=
sly or not - with the Scriptural and Patristic texts, so as to draw some poss=
ible conclusions on the way in which the poetess carries out the themes of de=
ath and Last Judgement. Therefore, I would ask if there were any digital tool=
s (such as corpora or repertories or, maybe, ontologies) that could allow me =
to carry out the research I have presented.Kind regards,
Elisabetta Corsi.--===============6723212638616101274==
