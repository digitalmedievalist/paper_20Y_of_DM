scenario you have imagined. I.e. I am a single scholar creating my own data
(TEI XML), creating my own interface, hosting my data in a repository
(bitbucket), and struggling with ways to make this data (and its revisions)
available to other scholars and at the same establish some sort peer review
that will also be preserved for the long term.At the present I'm afraid I've kind of taken the second route described by
Peter.> There is another answer:

I've done 1 and 2, and know I'm struggling with 3 and 4.My data files and my interface are now conceived of as separate projects
(with separate repositories, again on BitBucket). I would love to move my
project from personal server to my institution's (or some other
institution's) server. But currently my library really does not have the
expertise to host my interface or even my raw xml data (in a git repository
or really any other form).My project is visible here: http://petrusplaoul.org
<http://petrusplaoul.org/>
http://www.petrusplaoul.org/about/The project is also being connected to a larger aggregate of projects (MESA:
http://mesa.performantsoftware.com/) using RDF data. They are not hosting
the data or the interface, so that does not help with preservation issues,
but they are attempting to be the kind of editorial board that you seem to
describe. They say that they will eventually provide some sort of
peer-review of the projects they support.As my project has grown, I have thought a lot about how I could develop an
INTERNAL peer-review system that works with a data set that is growing and
being perfected all the time.
Since you ask for an example here are a few links that try to explain my
current strategy which is always evolving.I'm currently trying to create a network of peer-review editors that provide
on-going peer-review reports of the data as progressively gets better. Each
peer-review report is supposed to be tied to a "canonical revision"
(identified by a TAG in the source tree). Ideally, at each canonical
revision, a new peer-review report would be commissioned.Here are a few links that explain my ideas further.
http://www.petrusplaoul.org/preditors/pre_guidelines.php
http://www.petrusplaoul.org/preditors/preditorslist.php
http://www.petrusplaoul.org/about/?t=3DcitationWhile I like my approach, it remains difficult to get other scholars to
actually do the process of peer-review or to provide a 'peer review report'.So in sum.=20
My data lives in a BitBucket repository which can be public or private
My interface can load its data directly from the repository, and in turn can
load and reload the data from any historical point in the source tree (this
allows a user to view any desired "canonical revision")
Finally, trying to create peer-review reports for small sections of the text
that then become part of the text and live within the repository.I hope that's not too off the thread. I felt like everyone was discussing
issues that I'm wrestling with all the time, so I thought I would chime in.

Subject:  [dm-l] Re: How to make your data live forever (and maybe your
project?)Dear Peter and others,Thank you for these helpful responses.I agree completely with your advice that one should seek out repositories
and generally try to get the data freely in the hands of as many as
possible. Daniel's point about DOIs is also very useful.Having said that, these are advice about how to avoid extinction in the
worst case scenario, e.g. when no one is actively curating, revising, or
hosting the data and it is in danger of disappearing because in the short
run there is no one to care.I am curious about how to prepare for the best case scenario, e.g. a single
scholar or small group of scholars create data files which are received by
the scholarly community as of sufficient value to be crowd curated
indefinitely. While the fact that the data will be CC-by means that the
crowd will be free to do what it wants, from a  pragmatic perspective it
seems like it would still be useful to have an editorial board of sorts Joel
mentioned in his post for the following reasons:1. To offer scholarly peer review to the revisions to the data, in effect
creating canonical revisions.
2. To curate guidelines and coordinate collaboration for this revision.
3. To own and administer the URL associated with the project (which is used
for minting URIs, for redirecting to content repositories, and to serve as
the single URL for finding the data).
4. To give some momentum to the project should interest wane for a period
after the initial researchers have stopped intense work on the data.I am very much aware and even happy with the fact that in a certain sense
the work of this editorial board is non-binding since the data is open and
people will do what they want with the data. At the same time, I believe
that scholarly peer review is valuable.So my question is, how do I structure this standing committee? Should it be
based at a university, a publisher, through a scholarly society, as a formal
non-profit corporation, as an informal agreement, etc?In the past such multi-generation collaboration might have occurred through
a press (various dictionaries for example) or through a scholarly society
(long running translation or publication series) but I am wondering about
how this model occurs in the digital age.I would love to see examples from formal arrangements others have made if
any.Thank you!David A. MichelsonAssistant Professor

Subject: How to make your data live forever (and maybe your project?)HI David=20
I think you are hitting upon a very sore point in the DH/editorial
communities.  We have had editorial projects launched all over the place,
with great enthusiasm and often, substantial funding.  Many now face exactly
the problem you outline: what happens after the PI/institution move on?
So, here are three things you can do which will help immensely:
1.  Explicitly declare all your materials as Creative Commons Share-alike
attribution: that is, **without** the 'non-commercial' use restrictions so
often (and wrongly) imposed by many projects.
2.  Place the data, so licensed, on any open server.  The Oxford Text
Archive is, after so many years, still the best place I know to put your
data.
That alone should be enough to make your data live forever.  And
wonderfully, these two options will cost you not a cent, and maybe just  a
few hours of your time to deal with the OTA deposit pack.Optionally, you could also:
3.  Place the data within an institutional repositiory.  This gives you the
option to use the IR tools to construct an interface, and provide basic
search and other tools.  In my mind, this option has been scandalously
underused by DH projects, for reasons which might be the subject of another
post.  But this does provide the opportunity for you to present your project
in a way that will connect its metadata with the whole world of OASIS etc
tools, and offer a sustainable interface.  The University of Birmingham
Research Archive gives some idea of how this might work: see (for example)
the entries for the Mingana collection (eg http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/84/)
and Codex Sinaiticus ( http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/1690/).There is another answer:
1.  Keep the 'non-commercial' licence restriction on your data.  You can
thereby claim that you are allowing all your fellow academics to use it
freely, while (if you choose) not actually making it freely available
outside your interface.
2.  Create an elaborate and very attractive interface to your data
3.  Persuade your university, or someone, to set up a DH centre, with a
minimum staff of a director and programmer, space and dedicated equipment
(say, 100K a year if you can swing this with part-time staff etc).  This DH
centre will then have the task of maintaining your data (which of course,
only the centre has), interface and project.  This centre can then deal with
all the issues you raise in your post.
4.  Persuade your university, or someone, to support data, interface and
project, in perpetuityWell, good luck with that!Peter
