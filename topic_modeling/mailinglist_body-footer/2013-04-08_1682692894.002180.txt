NE.  I thought it might be a good one to attend but have to work out the
cost - flights to the Saskatchewan from St Louis run close to $600 (one
way).  The due date for proposals is a little tight but manageable.best, Gene

> Proposals are invited for the Social, Digital, Scholarly Editing
> conference, to be held in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, from 11-13
> July 2013.  This conference comes at a critical inflection point in the
> transformation of scholarly editing caused by the two massive shifts of
> the digital revolution: the movement of all data into digital form and
> the creation of new modes of collaboration. For the first: the creation
> of massive amounts of data in digital form has already transformed the
> basic materials of scholarly editing, while digital tools offer new
> methods for exploration and publication. For the second: where scholarly
> editing in the past has been typically the work of a single dedicated
> scholar, the development of social media opens up the possibilities of
> collaborative work across whole communities. These changes affect every
> aspect of scholarly editing. This conference will explore the
> theoretical, practical, and social implications of these changes.
>
> Proposers accepted from this open call will join some thirty invited
