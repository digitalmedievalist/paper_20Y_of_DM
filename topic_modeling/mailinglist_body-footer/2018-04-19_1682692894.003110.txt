seums committed to free online access to their collections of pre-modern manu=
scripts. Our website unites scattered resources from many institutions into a=
 national digital platform for teaching and scholarly research. It serves to =
connect an international user community to multiple repositories by means of =
a digital union catalog with sample images and searchable metadata.DS has valiantly served manuscript researchers around the world since it was =
launched in 1997. However, as online technology has changed dramatically sinc=
e then and digitization has become the norm rather than the exception, DS's E=
xecutive Board is undertaking a strategic planning initiative to address the =
future of DS and what needs to be done to ensure its critical contribution to=
 manuscript studies on a national and global level.As part of this process, we would like to get your input on the current DS pl=
atform and your suggestions for ways that DS might improve in any aspect. To =
this end, we invite you to complete a short survey (5-10 mins) to help us det=
ermine how DS is used, what works and what doesn't, and who uses it and why. =
The survey can be accessed through this link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/=
