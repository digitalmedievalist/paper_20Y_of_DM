(King's College London)=20
announce the launch of the new DigiPal website at http://digipal.eu=20For those of you who haven't been following our progress, DigiPal is a web-ba=
sed resource for the=20
delivery of palaeographical content. Although our test case is eleventh-centu=
ry Anglo-Saxon vernacular=20
script, the underlying DigiPal framework has been designed to work with multi=
ple periods and languages,
and we already have Scandinavian and Hebrew projects using our tools, with th=
e intention to extend the=20
framework to further materials, including cuneiform.At present, there are c. 300 high quality images available on our site and we=
've annotated over 12,000=20
individual letters.=20Oh, and thanks to funding from the ERC (EU FP7), everything is available for =
free ;-)To get you started, here are a couple of serving suggestions:A) For f. 29v of Cambridge, Corpus Christi College 173, visit: http://www.dig=
ipal.eu/digipal/page/110/   Things you might like to try:   1) Turn annotations On/Off
   2) Click on a highlighted letter to see our description
   3) Click on "Filter annotations" to highlight a particular letter, or seri=
es of letters, that we have annotated
   4) Click on the "Annotations by allograph" tab. If you click on an allogra=
ph, it will take you back to the ms=20
        context, with that letter highlighted
   5) Click on the "This record has 19 images" to see other folios from this =
ms.NB: The metadata is very basic at the moment. Eventually, there will be all s=
orts of information, including=20
        Ker, Scragg, Gneuss, Sawyer, etc. numbers. A summary of the content o=
f the manuscript. Information=20
        aggregated from other projects who have generously shared their data,=
 e.g.=20
       "English Manuscripts 1060 to 1220": http://www.le.ac.uk/english/em1060=
to1220/mss/EM.CCCC.173.htmB) To see all the manuscripts from Cambridge, Corpus Christi College currentl=
y in the DigiPal database, visit:    http://www.digipal.eu/digipal/page/?town_or_city=3D&repository=3DCorpus+C=
hristi+College&date=3DNB: Click on the "Images" button on the right to see thumbnail images.With a big thank you to everyone who has helped us to get this far! There's c=
. 18 months of the project left=20
and *much* more to come still. So, please get in touch with feedback and enco=
uragement ;-)Have fun, Stewart
