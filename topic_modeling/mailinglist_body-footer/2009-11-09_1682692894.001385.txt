Codicology and Palaeography in the Digital Age II -It is only a year since the Institute of Documentology and Scholarly=20
Editing (IDE) undertook an initiative entitled "Codicology and=20
Palaeography in the Digital Age". Yet its first results have already=20
been written up and published: in July 2009, the anthology "Codicology=20
and Palaeography in the Digital Age" was launched at an international=20
symposium in Munich. Here, experts from all over the world met as a=20
community to share their knowledge, interests and concerns regarding=20
digital issues in the various fields of manuscript research.The feedback on both the anthology and the conference has been=20
remarkably positive, not least from experts who are less acquainted with=20
digital methods. For the first time, widely dispersed, cutting-edge=20
research in the field of computer-aided codicology and palaeography can=20
be surveyed and assessed as a whole phenomenon.Yet, despite the fact that the anthology gives a broad insight into=20
theory and practice, some relevant subjects and questions have not been=20
covered. For this reason the IDE plans to publish a second volume of=20
"Codicology and Palaeography in the Digital Age". The following=20
questions in particular should now be addressed:     * To what extent can quantitative approaches and the analysis of=20
codicological databases be complemented by a systematic analysis of=20
digital manuscript facsimiles?
     * How can manuscript-related research in the history of arts or in=20
musicology be supported by digital tools and methodology?
     * How successfully can methods from the sciences be applied to the=20
analysis of manuscripts (e.g. DNA analysis of parchment)?
     * How can electronic manuscript-catalogues and virtual libraries be=20
brought together by means of comprehensive portals and hybrid research=20
environments in order, for example, to facilitate exhaustive semantic=20
studies?
     * How can existing digital tools for palaeographic transcription be=20
promoted and improved? How can the range of applications be expanded?=20
How can philological analysis and further use in literary studies be=20
enhanced?
     * How can questions about the history of script be addressed by=20
digital methods?
     * How can digital resources best supplement the originals, in the=20
context of restoration and preservation? How can archives, libraries and=20
museums take advantage of the opportunities, for public benefit?
     * To what extent are software-generated answers to codicological=20
and palaeographic questions sustainable, verifiable and reliable?Contributions which explore these and similar subjects (cf. previous=20
CfP) are most welcome and can be submitted in English, French, German or=20
Italian. Again, the launch of the volume will be accompanied by an=20
international symposium.  Proposals of not more than 500 words should be=20
sent by 30 November 2009 to kpdz-ii(a)ide.de or any of the editors listed=20
