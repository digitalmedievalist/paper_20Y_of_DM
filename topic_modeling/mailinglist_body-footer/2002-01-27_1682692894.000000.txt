    I'd like to thank you for the great interest you have shown in this 
list. I see that a welcome message I had set up to explain the list's 
goals did not always go out. I thought I'd break the ice, therefore, by 
mentioning a bit more about our goals for this list.
    As I said in the notice announcing the list, <dm-l(a)uleth.ca> is the 
first part of the Digital Medievalist Project. In its final form, this 
will be a "Community of Practice" for medievalists working with digital 
media. There will be a refereed on-line journal for research articles, 
commentary pieces, project reports, bibliography, and reviews, and a 
notice board/community centre where we will be able to exchange 
expertise, establish and announce new projects, share tips, post 
examples, and work together on common problems. Our designer is working 
on the site right now. We hope to have it up by September, with the 
first issue of the journal following later in the Fall. I'll be issuing 
a cfp for some remaining slots in the first two issues of the journal 
very soon. As some of you know, we also began sponsoring conference 
sessions at Kalamazoo this year. We hope to do the same next year, and, 
in the near future at Leeds.
    Our goals for this list are similar to those for the project as a 
whole. We hope that this will become a collegial forum for the exchange 
of expertise and the development of best practice in the use of digital 
media by medievalists. There are a number of other lists that cover 
aspects of the material we will be discussing here (e.g. tei-l for Text 
Encoding Initiative encoding matters; humanist-l for general aspects of 
computing and the humanities). Our hope is that the distinguishing 
feature of this list will be its focus on the practical needs of a 
specific community rather than a specific topic. I.e. rather than 
specialising in one aspect of research involving digital media, we hope 
to serve as a clearing house and community centre for information on the 
entire process of producing digital resources by people with an interest 
in medieval studies. The topics covered, therefore, may be specific to 
the middle ages (e.g. problems encoding or producing digital images of 
manuscripts or archaeological artefacts), or of more general application 
(e.g. questions involving interface design, or advice on tools). We 
imagine our discussion will often involve material from other, more 
specialised lists and resources, and encourage you to direct members to 
these lists (and report back on the answers) when they are better suited 
to the questions involved.
    In short, the goal of this list is to build a community of people 
with a common interest. By sharing expertise and information, we hope 
gradually to improve the ability of all to work in the new media.
