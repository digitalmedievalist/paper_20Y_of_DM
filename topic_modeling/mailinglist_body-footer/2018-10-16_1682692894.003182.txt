https://dig-ed-cat.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/ looking especially at editions of
medieval texts. Mostly this is for examples for teaching about editions,
courses, workshops, to look at in comparison with others.I was trying to find a good example of some digital editions of late Middle
English (~Chaucer onwards) that I wasn't already aware of from this
catalogue.Any suggestions of ones not included in it?Thanks for your help,James--===============4868917383686416544==
