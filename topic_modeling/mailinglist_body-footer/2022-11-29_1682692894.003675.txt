Dear Friends of the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series,On behalf of the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series, I am writing to request y=
our help in supporting METS's digital redesign efforts by completing =
the following user survey linked here<https://tinyurl.com/mets-redesign> as w=
ell as at the bottom of this email, along with a mobile-friendly QR code.Over its thirty-two years of publishing, METS has published and provided free=
 online access to hundreds of digital editions of medieval texts, many of whi=
ch would otherwise be rare, prohibitively expensive, or nonexistent as tradit=
ional print editions. These open-access editions have made it possible for in=
structors, students, and researchers alike to teach, learn, and advance schol=
arship on medieval British literature wherever they are in the world. An open=
-access digital collection, however, is only as accessible and useful as its =
website and user interface allow it to be =E2=80=93 and over the past few yea=
rs, it has become clear that both the METS website and its approach to digita=
l editions need an update. Feedback from users like you will be pivotal in re=
imagining both with the needs of our diverse user base in mind.This user survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. At the end, =
you will have the option to indicate if you would be open to (1) sharing furt=
her thoughts on the digital redesign in a follow-up conversation and/or (2) h=
elping with usability testing for the redesigned website in the future.Finally, please note that this survey will stop collecting responses on Decem=
ber 31, 2022, at 11:59 pm Eastern Time (UTC-5:00), so please make sure to com=
plete the survey before this deadline.On behalf of METS, thank you for considering this request =E2=80=93 I look fo=
rward to your response.Best wishes,
