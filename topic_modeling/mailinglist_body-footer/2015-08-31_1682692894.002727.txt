they know. There are some great paid internships available, including two
in my labs at the U of L. The programme is aimed at international students
(from high, mid, and low income economies) who wish to intern with Canadian
academics.Our positions involve XML work on journals or 3D and Linked Open Data work
on the Visionary Cross project. We welcome excellent students in either of
these. But there are lots of other positions available!-dan--===============4361780848968978837==
