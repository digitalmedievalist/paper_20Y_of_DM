ges! Applications of translation alignment in digital environments
Live at https://youtu.be/R2Ms6yAMZss
In this seminar, we will introduce the topic of translation technologies, wit=
h particular regard to text and translation alignment, one of the most import=
ant and complex tasks of NLP. Then, we will present Ugarit (http://ugarit.ial=
igner.com/<https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=3Dvideo_description&redir_t=
oken=3DQUFFLUhqa29DRnZFMENwZmMzQUxDZGlvSTdfWE50OXMwQXxBQ3Jtc0ttOExNbEdOUVZ6Zj=

ugarit.ialigner.com%2F>), a web-based tool for manual and automatic alignment=
 of parallel corpora. Conceived as a Citizen Science project to collect train=
ing data for the implementation of statistical machine translation of Ancient=
 Greek, Persian, and English, Ugarit has now become one of the most used digi=
tal environments for the manual alignment of texts in underrepresented and hi=
storical languages. Currently, Ugarit hosts corpora in 43 languages, and has =
been widely used in scholarly projects for the study of Armenian, Persian, Ar=
abic, Ancient Greek, Latin, Portuguese, and Egyptian. It has also been succes=
sfully applied in language teaching to facilitate a direct approach to origin=
al texts through the scaffolding provided by the systematic comparison with t=
ranslations.
While most translation technologies are limited to the coverage of modern, wi=
dely indexed languages like English, Ugarit introduces a new way of working w=
ith languages that is based on manual alignment between parallel texts: with =
the systematic support of translations in a known language, users can create =
datasets of aligned pairs to support language learning for themselves, study =
the reception of a particular text, or to provide alignments for other reader=
s. Moreover, users contribute training data for the implementation of statist=
ical machine translation for underrepresented languages, which has been teste=
d for Persian and Ancient Greek. The database of Ugarit can also be visualize=
d and queried to investigate relationships across languages that have not bee=
n directly aligned: by using the underlying graph database, we can visualize =
connections between words in two different languages by using a third languag=
e as a bridge, with which both languages have been aligned, and investigate b=
roader phenomena such as word frequency across languages and common tendencie=
s in translations.ALL WELCOME
