Humanities With apologies for cross-posting; please redistribute: Postdoctoral Fellowship at MARGOT The MARGOT <http://margot.uwaterloo.ca>  Annotation Tool project (imageMAT),
funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation  Scholarly Communications and
Technology Program (2011-2012), invites applications to its 2011 competition
for a postdoctoral fellowship. imageMAT offers a one-year postdoctoral
fellowship valued at $31,500 + 14% vacation pay and benefits to PhD students
in the final year of their program and recent graduates. Applicants must
have knowledge in medieval iconography and/or literature and manuscript
culture/production. Applicants must also have solid computer skills. The
postdoctoral fellow will provide scholarly leadership and, more generally,
add scholarly content to the project site such as manuscript descriptions
and blog posts. He/she will consult on content creation, and assist the
developer and McWebb with the training of graduate students in content
creation and be responsible for site moderation. Knowledge of French would be an asset, but is not required. The award is
tenable at the University of Waterloo <http://uwaterloo.ca> , Waterloo,
Ontario, and is supervised by Christine McWebb. The start date is September
1, 2011.
Applicants must not hold a tenure or tenure-track position or other
full-time employment. Fellows are expected to engage in full-time
postdoctoral research during the term of the award.  Preference will be given to recent graduates, that is, to graduates applying
within five years of receiving their doctoral degree. The awards are not
renewable beyond the first year. Please send a cover letter, current c.v., and the names of three referees by
