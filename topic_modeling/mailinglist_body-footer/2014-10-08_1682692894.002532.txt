Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitDear Digital MedievalistsI'm glad to inform you about a database which might be of some  
interest to those of you working on the late eleventh century, the  
investiture conflict or papal history.Today, I've finished and published a database collecting and  
containing information on where and in which collections/contexts the  
letters of pope Gregory VII were transmitted.www.g7ldb.history.uni-tuebingen.deNo full text of any letter is included (yet?) but nevertheless you can  
do rather advanced search queries. There are also a synopsis of  
letters and collections and a visualisation of the transmission. Both  
show ALL elements by default, but are designed to display your  
selection of items.I appreciate any feedback, via mail or the forms at the bottom of each  
page in the database.For those of you rather interested in the technical side, just a few  
words: The raw data is all in XML, with some elements in TEI. Wherever  
possible, static HTML pages are created via XSLT. Search and synopsis  
and visualisation of user selections are also done with XSLT, but in  
real time on the server using Saxon/C. PHP is used to manage these  
transformations and also the user sessions. eXist or any other XML  
database is nowhere involved.
I guess, this solution is somehow “unorthodox”, but after all: It's  
working! (At least, I hope so.)I hope, the database is of some use at least to some of you!Best regards
Christian
