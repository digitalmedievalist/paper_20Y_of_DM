Loss
November 17-19, 2021Engaging with pre-modern books and manuscripts necessarily involves reckoning=
 with the paradox of loss. While a historical document from the distant past =
is the material survivor of a singular attempt to hedge against the disappear=
ance of an idea, image, or text, the extant specimen always has to be conside=
red alongside missing exemplars, damage and erasure, lost comparanda, and the=
 vanished life-worlds that produced the object in the first place. This sympo=
sium will interrogate the notions of loss, survival, and recuperation in manu=
script studies, so often in the background but rarely acknowledged as definin=
g features of the field.Bringing together scholars, librarians, curators, and conservators, we will i=
nvestigate losses unknowable and quantifiable, ancient and recent, large and =
small, physical and digital. How have chance survivals shaped literary and li=
nguistic canons? How might the topography of the field appear differently had=
 certain prized unica not survived? What are the ways in which authors, compi=
lers, scribes, and scholars have dealt with lacunary exemplaria? How do longs=
tanding and emergent methodologies and disciplines-analysis of catalogs of di=
spersed libraries, reverse engineering of ur-texts and lost prototypes, digit=
al reconstructions of codices dispersi, digital humanities. and cultural heri=
tage preservation, and trauma studies to name a few,-serve to reveal the exte=
nt of disappearance? How can ideologically-driven biblioclasm or the destruct=
ion wrought by armed conflicts -- sometimes occurring within living memory --=
 be assessed objectively yet serve as the basis for protection of cultural he=
ritage in the present? In all cases, losses are not solely material: they can=
 be psychological, social, digital, linguistic, spiritual, professional. Is m=
ournful resignation the only response to these gaps, or can such sentiments b=
e harnessed to further knowledge, understanding, and preservation moving forw=
ard?The online program will take place in morning and afternoon sessions (EST) fr=
om Wednesday, November 17, to Friday, November 19. The symposium will end wit=
h a keynote address by Professor Elaine Treharne, Stanford University..For more information and to register, please visit https://www.library.upenn.=
