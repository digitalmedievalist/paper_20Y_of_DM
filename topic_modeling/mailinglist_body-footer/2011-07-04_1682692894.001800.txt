vote, please fill in the brief survey at:http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/VDRG7CR
You do not have to be a medievalist to vote, nor highly technical.  If
you are on the DM-L mailing list (where this message has been posted),
then that is the only qualification needed to vote.  The only
information we ask is to confirm the email address you are subscribed
with, and choose (up to four) candidates to vote for. (There is an
optional question about how DM can improve at the end.)  The
biographies of the candidates are available on the survey page. The
information will be destroyed afterwards.The survey will close at midnight GMT this Friday 8th July 2011.
The slate of candidates is impressive:Fred Gibbs
Yin Liu
Samantha Rayner
Malte Rehbein
Torsten Scha√üan
Grant Simpson
Peter Stokes
Dominique StutzmannPlease cast your vote early at http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/VDRG7CRMany thanks,James Cummings (Director, Digital Medievalist)
