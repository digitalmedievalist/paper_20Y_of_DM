Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableThanks Peter,My first thought was exactly what you say - that article 5 only
applies after the work passes into the public domain (after life + 70
years). But if the text from which my hypothetical 1974 edition was
made was in the public domain to begin with, wouldn't the edition fall
under Article 5, not Article 1?DotOn 4/17/06, Peter Robinson <P.M.Robinson(a)bham.ac.uk> wrote:
