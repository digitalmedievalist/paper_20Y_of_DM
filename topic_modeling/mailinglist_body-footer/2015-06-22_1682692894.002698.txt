on the organisation of the comital chancery in the counties of Flanders and
Hainaut (1191-1244). For her research she elaborated a new computer-aided
methodology to determine the editorial origin of charter texts. In 2012 she
received a COST Action grant for a short term scientific mission (one
month) at the Institut de Recherche et d'Histoire des Textes (IRHT) in
Paris, where she examined the interoperability between the Belgian and
French Latin source databases Diplomata Belgica and TELMA-databases
(Traitement =C3=89lectronique des Manuscrits et des Archives). Shortly

Studies, University of Toronto, and will be an RBC-Bodleian Visiting Fellow
at the Centre for the Study of the Book, University of Oxford in 2016. He
is currently producing TEI-encoded collections of the unpublished works of

magistri Willelmi de Monte (Notes from the School of William de Montibus)
will be published by PIMS in 2015 through the Toronto Medieval Latin Texts
series.*****************************
GRETA FRANZINIGreta Franzini is a Classicist by training. She is currently pursuing a PhD
at the UCL Centre for Digital Humanities (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh),
University of London. There, she conducts interdisciplinary research in
Latin philology, codicology, literary criticism and text visualisation.
Greta's specific interests lie within (ancient) languages, codicology and
digital editions. Part of her doctoral studies has resulted in the creation
of a Catalogue of Digital Editions (
https://sites.google.com/site/digitaleds/home) and the final output of her
PhD will consist of a digital documentary edition of an early Latin
manuscript (https://sites.google.com/site/gretafranzini/home). In order to
fund her doctoral studies, Greta works as a full=C2=ADtime early career
researcher (http://etrap.gcdh.de) at the Göttingen Centre for Digital
Humanities (GCDH) (http://www.gcdh.de/en/), University of Göttingen. The=
re,
she's involved in research pertaining to historical text re=C2=ADuse and join=
tly
coordinates the Göttingen Dialog in Digital Humanities (
http://www.gcdh.de/en/events/gottingen=C2=ADdialog=C2=ADdigital=C2=ADhumaniti=
es/), a
seminar series inspired by the Digital Classicist but with a broader scope.
Prior to Göttingen, Greta worked on the Open Greek and Latin Project (
http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/projects/open=C2=ADgreek=C2=ADand=C2=ADlatin=
=C2=ADproject/) at
the University of Leipzig, where she coordinated three major digitisation
projects (imaging, OCR and TEI XML encoding) aimed at producing open
digital versions of a large number of Ancient Greek and Latin printed
editions.*****************************
GREGORY HEYWORTHAfter taking a BA in English from Cambridge and a Ph.D. from Princeton in
Comparative Literature, Gregory Heyworth began his career at the University
of Mississippi as a medievalist with a specialty in textual studies and
classical influence. His first book, Desiring Bodies: Ovidian Romance and
the Cult of Form (Notre Dame, 2009), won the 2010 Choice Oustanding
Academic Title award. His interest in textual science and digital
humanities began with his edition of the badly damaged Old French poem Les
Eschez d'Amours (Brill, 2013) which he recovered using a transportable
multispectral imaging system he developed with a grant from the National
Center for Preservation Technology and Training. In 2010, Heyworth  founded
and now directs the Lazarus Project, a non-profit initiative to recover
damaged cultural heritage objects using various imaging technologies. Since
its inception, the Lazarus Project has digitally restored scores of damaged
works and objects in libraries and collections around the world, including
the Vercelli Book and the Martellus Map; it has supported the research of
numerous scholars by offering its technology and expertise, and has
launched major multispectral digitization projects in Chartres, Tblisi, and
Vercelli. Behind the Lazarus Project is a curriculum in textual science
that Heyworth developed to train students in a combination of the history
of the book, codicology, and spectral imaging, imaging science, and digital
display. He is currently working on an edition of the oldest translation of
the Gospels into Latin, a book entitled Textual Science and the Future of
the Past Roger Easton, and a promising neural net approach to manuscript
OCR with his student Eleanor Anthony.

NICOLAS PERREAUXDoctor in Medieval History, currently postdoctoral researcher at Paris XII
(ANR Pocram), I have been interested since childhood in technology and
programming. After graduating in Science, I headed for the Humanities and
Social Sciences. My Master, directed by Eliana Magnani, led me to apply the
methods of data mining to diplomatics corpora. Through a doctoral contract,
I realized a thesis (directed by Daniel Russo and Eliana Magnani, supported
in 2014), based on the manipulation of several major archaeological and
textual corpora. This research allowed me to acquire skills in data / text
mining, digital humanities, exploratory statistics, geographic information
systems, programming (Perl) and historical semantics. During the period
2009-2015, I have worked with several collaborative research projects,
including four ANR, all of them about Digital History. Since February 2015,
I am postdoc at Paris XII.*****************************DOMINIQUE STUTZMANNAfter degrees in Classics, History and German studies at the Sorbonne,
Dominique Stutzmann studied at the =C3=89cole nationale des Chartes
<http://www.enc.sorbonne.fr/> (2002), received a MLIS and worked at the
Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin and the Bibliothéque nationale de France
<http://www.bnf.fr/>. He completed a PhD on scribal practices of Cistercian
communities in medieval Burgundy (statistical analysis of scribal profiles
based on TEI encoding). In 2007-2012 and 2015 onwards, he is lecturer for
medieval paleography and digital scholarly edition at the =C3=89cole Pratique
des Hautes =C3=89tudes <http://www.ephe.sorbonne.fr/> and, since 2010, senior
researcher at the Institut de Recherche et d'Histoire des Textes
<http://www.irht.cnrs.fr/> (CNRS). He currently leads as Principal
Investigator several research projects in the field of digital humanities (
