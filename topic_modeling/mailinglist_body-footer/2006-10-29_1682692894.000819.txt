ta
crunching.  I have been using Excel for some work I am doing on Old English
poetry where I am looking at specific features of a fixed set of poems.=20
However, I have decided also to look at other aspects of the same set of poem=
s.To put it in a nutshell, I have three sets of data I want to compare concerni=
ng
the same poems in order to see where the trends are.  I know how to use Excel
fairly well - at least to get statistical information - but I have been getti=
ng
into trouble when trying to find trends across several sets of data.  I thoug=
ht
about pivot tables, but I am not sure if that's the way to go, when I think
that I may be able to do things easier in Access - even though I don't know
anything about how to use it.Which application would you suggest I use?Best,
Abdullah Alger
