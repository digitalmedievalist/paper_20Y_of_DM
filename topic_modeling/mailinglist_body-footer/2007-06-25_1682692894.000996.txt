The Silchester Roman Town Life Project is experimenting with new 
digital approaches to the capture of data from the excavation and to 
the subsequent analysis and publication of the stratigraphic record and
its associated sets of material and biological finds.  The overarching 
aim is to speed up the process between excavation in the field and 
subsequent publication, including the more effective integration of the
research team into the publication programme.All are welcome.

everyone is also welcome to join us in entertaining the speaker at a
