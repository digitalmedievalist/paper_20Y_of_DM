3D approaches to cultural heritage and landscapeThursday September 24
Institute of Classical Studies
Senate House, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HUThe Institute of Classical Studies is offering a training workshop for
postgraduate students and researchers on the use of 3D approaches in
the study of cultural heritage artefacts and landscapes. The workshop
will offer a basic introduction to the principles behind 3D imaging,
modelling and representation of terrain and elevation, and how these
can be used in research as well as visualisation. It will also give
participants hands-on experience using simple and free software
packages to produce complete 3D models and visualisations, with
methods easily transferable to their own research.No previous digital experience is required, but participants should
bring a laptop and a digital camera or smartphone and be prepared to
install some free software in advance of the workshop. This workshop
has been made possible by the generous support of the LAHP and AHRC.*Registration is free.*
