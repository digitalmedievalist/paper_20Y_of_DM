ital content within the education sector is becoming increasingly important. =
Substantial investment goes into the creation of digital resources for resear=
ch, teaching and learning and, in the current economic climate, both content =
creators, publishers as well as funding bodies are being asked to provide evi=
dence of the value of the resources they've invested in.But how do we go about defining value and impact? Which metrics should we ado=
pt to understand usage? When is a digital resource a well used resource?This one-day event will explore these and other key issues and showcase the w=
ork of the JISC-funded Impact and Embedding of Digitised Resources<http://www=
