drive?I ask this not to disparage the advice for github, but because when I 
switch, I need something that really eliminates this problem (that is to 
say: be easily trainable to skittish people) rather something than 
replaces it with something else. I don't mean eliminating it in my 
research projects; only a project where there is a lot of turnover and 
people who need only brief access.
