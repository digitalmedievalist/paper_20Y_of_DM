‘From lost archives to digital databases’
*
Of the leather documents used by the administration and individuals of 
the Seleukid empire (ca 312- 63 BC), all that remains are the small 
pieces of clay that were used to seal them; these however survive in 
their tens of thousands in Mesopotamia and the Levant. In this paper I 
will consider the potential and limitations of using these lumps of mud, 
through the construction of digital databases and statistical analysis, 
to reconstruct these lost archives, and to understand the imperial 
structures of the Seleukid power.Full abstract is available at
