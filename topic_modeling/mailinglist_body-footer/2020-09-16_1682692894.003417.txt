Elaine Treharne
Thursday 24th September, 18h00 (BST)
https://research.ncl.ac.uk/atnu/news/virtualspeakerseries202020211.htmlProfessor Elaine Treharne<https://english.stanford.edu/people/elaine-treharne=
> from Stanford University and Stanford Text Technologies<https://texttechnol=
ogies.stanford.edu/> will join us for the first in this year's ATNU visiting =
speaker series, via zoom. Elaine's talk promises a lively discussion on textu=
al representation, beautiful books and, just as a sample text, Beowulf. Join =
us on the 24th of September at 18h00 (BST) from wherever you are in the world=
. See the abstract below for more information, and don't forget to register t=
o receive the joining link<https://forms.ncl.ac.uk/view.php?id=3D9147398>. Th=
e talk is open to all.Abstract:I am interested in three things, all of which center on textual wholeness; my=
 example=E2=80=94'Beowulf'=E2=80=94is simply a case study of a larger theory =
about representations of TEXT. I'll ask: i) What can we say about Beo=
wulf in the context of London, British Library, Cotton MS Vitellius A. xv=E2=
=80=94a book beautiful, without doubt; ii) How did nineteenth- and twentieth-=
century editors and writers try to make of Beowulf a book beautiful? iii) And=
 finally, what can we say about a bodiless Beowulf?=E2=80=94 =E2=80=98Beowulf=
 Beyond': the poem in the digital era, beyond the confines of print.I'll examine editions of Beowulf in a variety of media, including fac=
simile, digitized, and digital instantiations of the work. This will allow us=
=E2=80=94as a collaborative=E2=80=94to reflect upon whether or not any editio=
n can ever be considered more than an illusion: that which is, in essence, an=
 incorrect experience.Register for zoom link at: https://forms.ncl.ac.uk/view.php?id=3D9147398
