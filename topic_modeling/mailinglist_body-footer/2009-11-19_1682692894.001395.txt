Hello Dan,Have no fear. Currently the 'DigitalMedieval' twitter feed is set up
only to forward DM's news feed (and twitterfeed.com seems to be being
highly selective in forgetting to forward some things in any case!) so
anything posted has to undergo the same moderation as posting news
items (approval by a number of volunteers on the board).  As the
person who set up the account I can, if necessary, post something
manually. In my announcement of it when I suggested that we might add
something extra to it during conferences, I was only thinking we might
update it with reminders of important digital/medieval sessions or
something like that.  I don't think anyone would  suggest using any of
the official DM channels for criticising anyone, at any point!But otherwise I'd say that what people post on their very own
non-official twitter feeds, facebook statuses, blogs, webpages, or
bulletin boards is a matter for their own consciences. (It is perhaps
interesting to note the different modes of writing people use in such
things, compared to email and traditional publication, but that is, of
course, a different conversation.)
