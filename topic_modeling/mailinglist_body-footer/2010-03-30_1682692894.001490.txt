of the new Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts.  Since early November, a new
search interface has been available in beta version for testing. Thanks to
feedback from users, we have been able to revise and upgrade search
functionality to offer users a more flexible, powerful, and accurate search.The revised  <http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/schoenberg> Schoenberg
Database of Manuscripts is now available through the Penn Libraries' Digital
Library Architecture. The new search interface features: *	Faceted searching on over 25 fields 
*	Greater search flexibility with multi-field keyword and numeric
range advanced searching 
*	Comprehensive browse lists for sellers, collections, catalogues,
authors, titles, provenance, and more 
*	Revised transaction and bibliographic data for auction, sales, and
institutional catalogues 
*	Plus, the same commitment to providing the most accurate available
data on manuscripts produced before 1600 To access the website, click on the link above or go to:

http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/schoenberg .  Please send comments or
questions to Lynn Ransom (lransom(a)pobox.upenn.edu).The Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts makes available data on medieval
manuscript books of five or more folios produced before 1600 in order to
facilitate research for scholars, collectors, and others interested in
manuscript studies and the provenance of these unique books. Drawn from
auction and sales catalogues, inventories, catalogues from institutional and
private collections, and other sources that document sales and locations of
manuscript books, the records assist in locating and identifying particular
manuscripts, establishing provenance, and aggregating descriptive
information about specific classes or types of manuscripts. It was begun in
1997 by Penn Libraries Overseer Lawrence J. Schoenberg
<http://www.library.upenn.edu/portal/Schoenberg/about.html>  (C'53, WG'56).
In 2007, he entrusted the Penn Libraries with its maintenance and
development. The database now contains over 160,000 searchable records and
continues to grow on a daily basis.  ****************** Lynn Ransom, Ph.D.Project Manager, Lawrence J.
