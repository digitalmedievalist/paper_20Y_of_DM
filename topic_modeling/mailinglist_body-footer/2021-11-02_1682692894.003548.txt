dessaTara L. Andrews, University of ViennaFriday, December 17, 2021, 12:00 -1:30pm EST (via Zoom)Of the thirty-five manuscripts that remain of the 12th-century Chronicle of M=
atthew of Edessa, not a single one dates from before 1590, but over half of t=
hem were produced by 1700. This pattern of survival reflects a wider reality =
for Armenian literature, where the ravages of war and persecution, especially=
 in the 15th and 16th centuries, gave way to a period of relative peace in th=
e 17th century that provided an opportunity for a conscious "rescue" of the A=
rmenian literary heritage, especially (but not exclusively) centered around t=
he Amrdolu monastery of Bitlis, near Lake Van. In this talk I will present so=
me of the features and puzzles of the manuscript tradition of the Chronicle t=
hat speak to this restoration, and at the same time give us glimpses into the=
 history of the developing Armenian diaspora. Click here for more information=
