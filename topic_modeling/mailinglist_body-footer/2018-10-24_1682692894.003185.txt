######  Important Dates  ######Extended Submission Deadline: 5th November 2018
Notification: 15th December 2018###### Call for Papers ######The main topic of the AIUCD 2019 Conference is ‘Pedagogy, teaching, and
research in the age of Digital Humanities’. The conference aims at
reflecting on the new possibilities that the digital yields for pedagogy,
teaching, and scholarly research: how will these transform teaching in the
humanities? What contributions can humanistic cultural critique offer to
the digital revolution? What is the connection with the digitization plan
for Universities outlined by the Ministry? It also concerns the Digital
Humanities as a new discipline, and this brings forward further
considerations: how can the new professional figure of the digital humanist
be developed? Which areas of knowledge define the Digital Humanities as a
subject of study, research, and teaching? How can we recognise, classify,
describe, and evaluate research efforts in the Digital Humanities?While open to other topics related to Digital Humanities, proposals for
contributions are particularly encouraged on the following:General questions:
- the epistemological positioning and area of knowledge of DH in relation
to the systems of Academic Research Areas (Settori
Scientifico-Disciplinari) and  Recruiting in Italy;
- the positioning of DH in the European and International academic systems;
- the evaluation of research in DH beyond traditional publications;
- dissemination, public history, and crowdsourcing within research projects;
- the role of inter(multi-trans-cross)-disciplinary DH research in European
projects, enquiry, and teaching.Pedagogy and teaching questions:
- teaching DH: which models, technologies, and methods?
- teaching the humanities in secondary schools and universities with DH

- DH and media: production, dissemination, and analytical prospects
- teaching history and DH;
- DH and didactic strategies;
- DH and hands-on teaching practices;
- DH and primary source teaching;

integration;
