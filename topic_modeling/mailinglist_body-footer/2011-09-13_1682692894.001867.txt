see if the community had any thoughts on this. That rephrasing probably does
make it clearer. We'll consider modifying it inline with this before putting
it to the community for a vote.> And b) personally, and speaking as a Canadian, I find a simple majority to

community vote to be two-thirds of recorded votes.  If there is a 5/3 split
on whether the proposals are a good idea, taking it to the community for an
RFC seems a fairly good step. (i.e. try to get feedback from the community
as to whether this or that is the right thing to do.)> I don't think it is likely to be a huge deal in practice of course. And
