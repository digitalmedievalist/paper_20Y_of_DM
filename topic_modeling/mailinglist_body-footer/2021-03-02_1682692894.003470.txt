land to discern gaps in capacity and training strategies, and to inform discu=
ssions around the creation of a future Association. We would love to hear you=
r views and would be very grateful if you would consider completing our short=
 survey<https://dariah-ireland.org/pollsurvey/index.php/1> by 15th March: man=
y thanks indeed.We hope to see as many of you as possible for the workshop on the 16th. Pleas=

teaching, research, and infrastructure development
UK-Ireland DH Network workshop
Tues 16th March, 10:00-16:00
Please register via Eventbrite<https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/digital-humanit=
ies-and-advocacy-tickets-139648718075>.
How should a DH Association for the UK and Ireland carry out advocacy? How ca=
n we ensure that any Association that emerges has both the authority and repr=
esentation to speak on behalf of DH communities of practice? What are the ent=
ities that need expert input from the DH community, and how can the Associati=
on ensure that it informs and shapes policy and other decision making process=
es?
The aim of this workshop is to discuss the policy areas in which DH interests=
 need to be heard, and discuss some shared, strategic challenges where a unit=
ed voice of those working in DH is needed. The workshop will explore the key =
issues that affect DH development in the UK and Ireland that have policy impl=
ications, areas where expert opinions and guidance may be needed, and the aud=
iences for these views.
We will focus on three key areas where advocacy is needed in DH: Research, te=
aching, and infrastructure.
In research, these issues include the way that DH tools, methods, and outputs=
 are assessed for national research assessment exercises and peer review of d=
igital content, tools, methods and research outputs, and the impact of open a=
ccess publishing on DH research outputs.
For teaching, central issues have emerged around shared curricula and teachin=
g assessment, especially the lessons learned from recent experimentation with=
 online course delivery.
In terms of infrastructure development, what are areas for investment that wi=
ll impact the development and uptake of DH? And what can we do to effect enga=
gement with those shaping policy regarding key infrastructure investment? Is =
there a need for a shared view? How can we advocate for DH, and to whom? How =
best can we facilitate international cooperation and collaboration: in the UK=
's post-Brexit landscape, how can we stay connected despite the loss =
of schemes like Erasmus? How can we ensure continued UK DH involvement in H20=
20?
And structurally, what model of DH Association in the UK and Ireland would un=
derpin an advocacy agenda? What membership models would support an organisati=
on that has a resonant and authoritative =E2=80=98voice' for our fiel=
d?
