will do what you want for all operating systems.You have a good Computer Science program at Lethbridge. Any undergrad
computer science student should be able to do what you want easily, quickly,
and for half a case of beer.You probably want to use OpenType fonts; if you use Postscript fonts you
will have to use a PS font shell like Adobe Type Manager on any Windows OS
earlier than Win2000 or Mac OS earlier than OSX. If you use truetype, you
will have to have Mac and PC (and what ever linux shell you are using)
version. The fonts aren't actually different; just different header
information. There is freeware out there that will convert between.You will have to put this all on a hybrid CD so the different OSs will
autorun the different installers. You won't really get an auto-execute on CD
insert...there will have to be an explicit command from the user ("A click
here to continue") sort of thing, but you can get the ball rolling.Also, you might have to consider the licensing of the font if you are
distributing it, unless you created it or own the license.Travis

Subject: Re: [dm-l] Autoinstall for fontsFirst, I am uneasy with the idea of installing anything automatically when 
a CD is loaded (I am assuming that by "loaded" you mean simply making the 
CD accessible - ie, just putting it in the drive). At the very least I 
would want to notify the user and provide the option of not doing it.Second, the procedure for installing fonts is very different on the various 
operating systems, and so would require an installer for each target 
system. For example, on Windows you only need to copy the appropriate files 
to the Font folder (usually \windows\fonts); on Mac you (I think) use a 
control panel. I very much doubt that you could have a single installer 
that would work for all systems.Third, what happens when a CD is loaded is different on each system; for 
example, Windows (if enabled to do so) executes a specific file on the CD 
(usually called AutoRun), which contains instructions on what to do next 
(which can be most anything - display an option menu, run an installer, 
load a web page, etc.). I don't know how it works on Mac and Linux, but I 
doubt it is the same. Once again, you would probably need a separate 
process for each system.In short, you would probably need a way to detect the type of system the CD 
is being loaded on, and react accordingly to install the fonts. I don't 
know of any such existing facility, and I suspect it would not be easy to
do.David
