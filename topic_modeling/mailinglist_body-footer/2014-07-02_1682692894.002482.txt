The Europeana network of Ancient Greek and Latin Epigraphy (EAGLE) and 
Linked Open DataALL WELCOMEThe Europeana network of Ancient Greek and Latin Epigraphy aims to 
provide historians and the general public with a curated online 
multi-text edition which has high quality contents and related contents 
as well as high quality data in multiple interoperable formats. Linked 
Open Data principles aim at bringing things together so we have tried to 
follow those guidelines. EAGLE considered two standards: TEIâ€“EpiDoc and 
CIDOC CRM and we work towards tools to facilitate wilful alignment as 
well as coordinated linking via third parties annotations or through the 
alignment to common vocabularies (of contents), gazetteers and 
bibliographies.*The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.*For more information please see the seminar website at
