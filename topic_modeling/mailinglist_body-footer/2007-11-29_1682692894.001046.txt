looked at the Bookends format manager and was impressed by the 
flexibility--not enough, to be sure, but a start. But this morning 
Bookends decided it could not hook up my reference "Cunningham, 1966" to 
the CCSL edition of Prudentius (though it had done so many times 
before): this happens to me quite a bit, and the workaround is to unscan 
the whole document (essentially unlinking from the database) and scan 
again (regenerating all the citations and bib entries). After that it 
decided for unknown reasons that the best citation for a number of works 
which it had rendered correctly before was a space--so the in-text 
reference looks like "( 85)." I'm sure there's a workaround for this 
too, but I have no idea what it is, and I'm of the school that holds 
that software should Just Work without a lot of kerfuffle. BibTeX, 
though inadequate in several ways (I'll spare everyone the rant), Just 
Worked. I won't go on with a tool that puts me through that kind of thing.I'll have a look at zotero, jabref and refdb next--but I might end up 
with biblatex in the end. Certainly for anyone committed to the TeX 
family of tools it looks terrific.PeterO'Donnell, Dan wrote:
