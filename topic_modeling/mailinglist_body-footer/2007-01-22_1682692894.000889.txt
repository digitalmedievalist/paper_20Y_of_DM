University of Lethbridge. Deadline for applications: February 15, 2007.We have two vacancies for permanent "Academic
Assistants" (http://www.uleth.ca/hum/Services/career_fac/English_Academic_Ass=
istant_November_2006_Web_Site.htm). These are career teaching positions that =
are often called "Lecturers" at other universities. The initial appointment w=
ill be for a probationary period of two years. Upon successful completion of =
the probationary period, incumbents will be offered continuing contracts.The minimum qualification for these positions is an M.A. in English or a
related discipline. A PhD is preferred. The successful candidates will
teach mostly junior-level literary courses in our department
(composition is taught in a different department at the University of
Lethbridge and faculty in English do not teach composition courses).
Successful candidates with a PhD will be eligible to teach senior-level
courses in their area of expertise depending on demand and the
scheduling requirements of the department. We are a small and
cooperative department: Academic Assistants can expect to play a role in
developing the shape of the curriculum over their careers.The area of specialisation for these positions is open. We are looking
for enthusiastic and accomplished teachers and are willing to work at
accommodating particular teaching specialisations into our course
offerings alongside the main focus on junior-level literary courses.=20The course load is expected to be seven 13 week courses per year.
Initially, we expect this to be distributed 3:3:1 (i.e. three courses
per semester in term with one additional course in the summer).
Successful candidates for these teaching positions will not have any
formal research requirement though they will be expected to keep up with
changes in the discipline and pedagogy.We are required by law to give preference to Canadian citizens and
permanent residents. This is an international search however, and
non-citizens and non-residents are eligible for consideration and
employment.If you have any questions about the positions, please feel free to
contact me at the addresses below.-Dan O'Donnell
