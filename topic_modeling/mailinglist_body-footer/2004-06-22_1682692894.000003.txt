wondering in particular if their xslt is standards compliant. I=20
understand from the XML bible=20
<http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/books/bible2/chapters/ch17.html> that it is=20
or was not. Microsoft's own pages make it sound like the latest versions=20
might be=20
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=3D/library/en-us/xmlsdk/ht=

but it can be difficult to trust them sometimes.I ask because a neat tool (Textpipe=20
<http://www.crystalsoftware.com.au/textpipe.html>) I use has now=20
built-in XSLT, but depends on MSXML.For those who don't know what I am talking about: XSLT (eXtensible=20
Stylesheet Language-Tranformations) is a stylesheet language used=20
(amongst other things) for converting documents written in XML=20
(eXtensible Markup Language) such as used by the TEI (Text Encoding=20
Initiative) into HTML for display on the web.Once the web site is up, we should put all these acronyms into a FAQ=20
(Frequently Asked Questions) file. Does anybody know of a good existing=20
list of acronyms for beginners?-dan--=20
