here as well. The newest edition of the TEI guidelines is introducing
quite a number of really useful tools, elements, and approaches. It is
about a month away from an official release and the last few things are
still being nailed down and copy-edited, but it going to be quite
interesting.The next release after this should also have a new section on physical
bibliography that will be of interest to medievalists as well.
