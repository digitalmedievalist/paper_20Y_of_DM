(http://www.visionarycross.org/), we are looking into using ontologies
as the basis for building a generalisable platform for connecting
representations of Anglo-Saxon cultural objects, tropes, texts, and the
like (the specific details of this approach, which we've been developing
over the last year, are still too nascent to be reflected in the
website). The idea would be to see if there might not be a way of
building a common, discipline-wide, set of minimal ontological
distinctions that museums, literary and historical scholars,
archaeologists, etc. could then use to place their particular objects of
study in the larger context of the work of everybody else who has used
the same ontology.If any other groups are working on the use of ontologies to represent
any aspect of the study of Anglo-Saxon England, I'd very much like to
hear from you. I suspect at the moment people working on this are mostly
likely to be in museums, libraries, or archaeology, but could be wrong.
I'm considering putting together a grant application that would help
fund the development of common standards and systems. Of course, with
ISAS coming up, their might be some opportunities to meet in the next
fortnight as well. Obviously at this stage, the idea is still fairly
exploratory.-Dan O'Donnell--
