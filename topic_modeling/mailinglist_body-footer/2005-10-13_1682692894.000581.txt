Subject: Re: [dm-l] Introduction and Question re Medieval Law TextsHere's one:digidev.library.ucla,edu/canionlaw/  Corpus Juris Canonici (1582)
"UCLA Digital Library, in collaboration with the Center for Medieval and 
Renaissance Studies, will present a facsimile edition of the Decretals 
of Gregory IX as they appeared with marginal commentary in the Corpus 
canonicum glossatum promulgated by Gregory XIII in 1580. This will be 
the first re-printing of the glossed text of the Liber Extra since the 
appearance of the editio Romana.This edition of the laws, edited by the Roman Correctors, and provided 
with numerous indexes to assist in navigating the canons and 
understanding terminology, will allow historians and legal scholars to 
study canon law with the aid of the original textual apparatus (glossa 
ordinaria). The publication of the Liber Extra will be followed during 
2006 by the appearance of the glossed texts of Decretum Gratiani and the 
Liber Sextus.The project is directed by Professor Henry Ansgar Kelly of the UCLA 
Department of English, and supported by a grant from the Gladys Krieble 
Delmas Foundation."
