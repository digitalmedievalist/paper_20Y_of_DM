http://www.mesa-medieval.orgThe Medieval Electronic Scholarly Alliance (MESA) is a federated
international community of scholars, projects, institutions, and
organizations engaged in digital scholarship within the field of medieval
studies. MESA seeks both to provide a community for those engaged in
digital medieval studies and to meet emerging needs of this community,
including making recommendations on technological and scholarly standards
for electronic scholarship, the aggregation of data, and the ability to
discover and repurpose this data.Read about MESA, click through to the Advanced Search, create an account,
add some tags, join in (or start) a discussion!Many thanks to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for funding, to the MESA
Steering Committee for steering us through the implementation process, to
our project partners for agreeing to have their projects and collections
included in the first iteration of MESA, and to all the medievalists who
have expressed support and interest through the last year.Any comments, thoughts, or criticism, please contact us at
mesa-medieval(a)gmail.com <mesamedieval(a)gmail.com>.Most Sincerely,Tim Stinson and Dot Porter, MESA co-directors--
