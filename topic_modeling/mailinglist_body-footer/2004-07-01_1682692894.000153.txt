In light of a recent announcement about an "extremely critical"
security vulnerability in Internet Explorer (IE), the U.S. Computer
Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has issued a warning advising
computer users to stop using Microsoft's browser. US-CERT is a
nonprofit formed in September 2003 by the Department of Homeland
Security and the public and private sectors to improve computer
security preparedness and response. According to the US-CERT notice,
there are "significant vulnerabilities in technologies relating to the
IE domain/zone security model, the DHTML object model, MIME-type
determination, and ActiveX." The IE bug allows hackers to install
spyware on users' computers without any action on the part of the
user. The notice goes on to say that, particularly for browsing
untrusted sites, use of another browser is an effective way to avoid
the security risks mentioned.
