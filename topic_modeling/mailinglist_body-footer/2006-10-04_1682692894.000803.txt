Thierry Daubos has been working on a project here to do 3D scans, mostly of
inscribed stones, but he'd be able to help you out. You can take a look at
his work at:
http://www.foundationsirishculture.ie
by clicking on the Profilometry of Medieval Monuments tab on the right.
Thierry's e-mail is thierry.daubos(a)nuigalway.ie
Hope this helps!
All the best,
MarkOn 04/10/2006 05.03, "Daniel O'Donnell" <daniel.odonnell(a)uleth.ca> wrote:> Hi all,
