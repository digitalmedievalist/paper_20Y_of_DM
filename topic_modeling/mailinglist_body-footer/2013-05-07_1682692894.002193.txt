the opportunity to connect two related web services for stemmatological
analysis of texts: Stemweb (https://github.com/Stemweb/Stemweb) provided by
researchers at the University of Helsinki, and Stemmaweb (
http://byzantini.st/stemmaweb/) provided by the Tree of Texts project at KU
Leuven in collaboration with the Huygens Institute.After a meeting in Helsinki we have produced a white paper on our plans for
interoperability, and we warmly invite comments or suggestions from any
interested scholar, researcher, and/or developer. We intend to begin work
in June, so comments received by the end of May would be particularly
helpful.The white paper is available here: http://treeoftexts.arts.kuleuven.be/?p=58
Comments may be mailed directly to the authors, or preferably added
directly to the blog post for open discussion.Best wishes,
Tara Andrews (tara.andrews(a)arts.kuleuven.be)
