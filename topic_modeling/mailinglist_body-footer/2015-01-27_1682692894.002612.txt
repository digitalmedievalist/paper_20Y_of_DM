we could turn it into a really good, deep discussion of what we've done
right, what we're doing wrong, and how cultural heritage markup (or its
equivalents) can be made better in the future. Heretics and True Believers
welcome! --Hugh
Cultural Heritage Markup:
Using Markup to preserve, understand, and disseminate cultural heritage
materials
a Balisage pre-conference symposiumMonday August 10, 2015
Bethesda North Marriott Hotel & Conference Center, Bethesda, MD, USAMarkup and markup technologies are used in a wide variety of cultural
heritage projects by linguists, students of literature, librarians,
historians, curators, and others. Markup is used behind the scenes in
archives, libraries, and museums to create and store metadata and the
textual content of a wide variety of materials both textual and
artefactual. We want to know how you or your project are using markup to
preserve, analyze, disseminate, or curate materials of long-term value to
society.Balisage is an excellent venue to discuss both theoretical and practical
questions. Is cultural heritage markup essentially different from
industrial markup? Is it inherently more heterogeneous, more complex? Are
=E2=80=9Cindustrial=E2=80=9D tools like XML and HTML really appropriate for c=
ultural
heritage materials? How well will standards like TEI and EAD serve us as
technology progresses? We dedicate this day to discussion of the challenges
and possibilities of markup technologies used in the preservation of our
cultural heritage and its transmission to future generations.
We welcome proposals to present at the Symposium. Topics may include, but
are not limited to:        =E2=80=A2 Representing heterogeneous materials
        =E2=80=A2 Data modeling to support scholarly research
        =E2=80=A2 Building for the long term, even after the money has run out
        =E2=80=A2 Using/repurposing tools that weren't designed for t=
he kind of
thing you're doing
        =E2=80=A2 Is XML really appropriate for representing texts of scholar=
ly
interest?
        =E2=80=A2 Is XML really appropriate for representing metatdata about
non-textual artefacts?
        =E2=80=A2 What does it mean for cultural heritage texts to be
interoperable? Is it desirable? Is it possible?
        =E2=80=A2 Shared tag sets. Do shared markup vocabularies (e.g., TEI, =
EAD,
LIDO, CDWA) do more harm than good?Full papers should be submitted by 17 April 2015. All papers are
peer-reviewed =E2=80=94 we pride ourselves that you will seldom get a more
thorough, skeptical, or helpful review than the one provided by Balisage
reviewers.
