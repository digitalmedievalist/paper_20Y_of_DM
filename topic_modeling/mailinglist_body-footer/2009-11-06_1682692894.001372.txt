you registered for the mailing list.  This is, in most cases, a name
and your email address.  The point is that revealing subscriber lists
of mailing lists is usually frowned upon because spam bots will read
the mailing list and send you lots of messages about things they want
you to buy.  That is why I'm reluctant to make it open, or even open
only to subscribers (because a spammer could join with a plausible
sounding name, copy the list of email addresses, and leave).> And congratulation for the 500 mark!Thanks! We wouldn't have gotten here without all of you. (literally)  ;-)-James
