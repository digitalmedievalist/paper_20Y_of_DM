the Bodleian rather than OUP. The Bodleian supported the project 
financially (the development of software), provided the images and 
contributed to the development of the interface. All the technical and 
academic work was done by Burnard Muir and his team. The images published 
on the CD were already available when the work on the project started six 
years ago: they are still available free of charge for personal use by 
researchers via Early Manuscripts at Oxford University 
(http://image.ox.ac.uk/). The next project in the series will be MS. Auct. 
F. 2.13 (Terence's Comedies). The images are also available via the Early 
Manuscripts at Oxford University site. The CD-ROM works only with Internet 
Explorer because Microsoft's implementation of JavaScript was used (you may 
have noticed the use of JavaScript in the extract posted by Martin). As far 
as I know Burnard Muir's team will try to overcome this limitation in the 
next CD-ROM.ElizabethDr. Elizabeth Solopova
