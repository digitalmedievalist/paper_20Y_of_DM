Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear AllI came from the computer industry before I came into academia and I think the=
 problem with digital authoring (at least as I have experienced it within the=
 academic community), is that sometimes digital authors either try to be too =
clever or to avoid all commercial packages like the plague. This causes them =
to opt sometimes for obscure readers/encoders that although 'free' probably d=
isappeared soon after the edition was created. For example, a digital edition=
 of Chaucer was authored around 1999 and used Dynatext, an SGML authoring too=
l. Inso the owners of Dynatext went out of business in 2002 and so of course =
the digital edition is largely unusable on later PCs and operating systems. I=
n this case, the error perhaps was not converting to PDF when the writing was=
 on the wall for Dynatext although the installed base of Dynatext was modest =
compared to PDF even at that time. This raises the issue of ongoing maintenan=
ce of course but see my comments later.By comparison, digital versions of a Shakespeare Octavo and the Sonnets that =
I purchased on CDs from the Folger library in 2000 are still working today. T=
he PDFs are locked/encrypted to protect the authors but they are searchable, =
are interactive and there are various scholarly resources that are associated=
 with the editions and which still operate just as they did when I bought the=
m. They have worked on everything from Windows 2000, through XP through Windo=
ws 8 and various Macs and versions of MacOS without problem and without chang=
e. Given that the installed base of PDF documents runs into multiple billions=
, PDF is unlikely to disappear anytime soon and given that PDF is largely a p=
ublished specification (which you can conform to), even if Adobe were to disa=
ppear tomorrow (unlikely), we could still read the documents into the future.TEI is excellent because it is a general purpose and extremely flexible encod=
ing system which can be used as a base to target all sorts of output formats =
(including PDF). Where TEI tends to fall down is that its output filters are =
not always that strong and a lot more could be done to improve them so as to =
take advantage of the features and facilities (modern interactive graphics) t=
hat commercial standards like PDF and ePUB have to offer. The general respons=
e from the TEI group (as I have heard it expressed) is that they don't really=
 see these filters as their job (the ones provided are largely examples). How=
ever, the reality is that for all authoring systems, it is the final output u=
sers see which colours their perception of any underlying authoring system. O=
f course for the development of such filters, funding is always an issue but =
it seems to me that companies like Adobe could be approached to assist as it =
would be in their interest to enhance the standing of PDF within the academic=
 community. Rather than treating such companies as 'the devil incarnate', it =
seems to me that more could be done to cooperate with them. To be fair, they =
have a lot more experience with developing file formats and encoding systems =
that have longevity than the academic community does. Of course Adobe have ha=
d false starts along the way, but PDF seems a good bet now as it's been aroun=
d for twenty years and they aren't going to drop it anytime soon if they want=
 to remain in business because they use it throughout their product lines. It=
 is also used by governments around the world as well as by high-end publishe=
rs and other users too numerous to mention here.It seems to me that we need to accept that commercial standards like PDF, giv=
en their huge installed base are here to stay for the long-term, have proved =
their worth in industry and commerce and perhaps we should reconsider using t=
hem for digital authoring. Either that, or let's really put some serious work=
 into the TEI export systems so that digital editions exported from a TEI bas=
e reflect the full functionality of the target format and the interactive gra=
phical features of the hardware platforms that are available at the time.Tony HarrisFrom: dm-l-bounces(a)uleth.ca [mailto:dm-l-bounces(a)uleth.ca] On Behalf Of J=

Subject: RE: [dm-l] New article on "Medievalists and the Scholarly DigitalEdi=
tion" -- who has actually been using these editions?Dear medievalists,Perhaps I may add one consideration to the discussion. I am an editor of sour=
ces who has published paper as well as digital editions, and I see the advant=
ages of the latter for the user. Of course, text editions are a special type =
of publications: edited by specialists, meant to last for decades or even cen=
turies (it is not that rare for a medievalist to use a seventeenth-century ed=
ition of a medieval chronicle), and in fact only consulted by other specialis=
ts (no matter how often a casual passerby has a peak in a bookstore or on a w=
ebsite).But I am also a historian, and therefore I know that all things must pass, al=
though some things are more durable than others. I think we can safely assume=
 that a text edition printed on paper will be on library book shelves all ove=
r the world a hundred years from now; I strongly suspect that our modern digi=
tal products by then will have evaporated, or will be inaccessible for the or=
dinary user. I am aware that durability is high on the agenda these days, but=
 we all know how fast the technological developments go. I suspect that in th=
e near future it will be increasingly difficult to have enough commitment and=
 money from the decision makers and the scholarly community to store the old =
digital stuff and keep it working on the new machines.Jan Burgers.From: dm-l-bounces(a)uleth.ca<mailto:dm-l-bounces(a)uleth.ca> [mailto:dm-l-bo=

Subject: Re: [dm-l] New article on "Medievalists and the Scholarly DigitalEdi=

I thank you very much for the extremely useful figures you have collected. I =
am an out-and-out supporter of digital editions, and yet I am afraid you unde=
restimate the "contacts" a book can have in a library or even in a bookstore.=
 I suppose that the figures of use of paper books, if we could count them, an=
d mainly the number of actual readers (not just "visits", that can come many =
times from the same user) would and will be bigger than the figures of equiva=
lent digital editions, but I have no evidence of that. So the only data we ca=
n correctly compare are the sold copies.
That said, we all have to do digital editions, whatever it may mean, and give=
n the anarchy that is distinctive of the web, no one can determine what a dig=
ital edition must be: we can just  propose methodological requirements for wh=
at we would accept to call *critical* digital editions and see which models b=
ecome successful or authoritative.
All the best,
Francesco Stella

Subject: Re: [dm-l] New article on "Medievalists and the Scholarly DigitalEdi=
tion" -- who has actually been using these editions?Dear everyone
there is a missing elephant in these discussions.  What evidence do we have t=
hat these editions are being used? who is using them?
Rather to my surprise, there seems remarkably little 'hard' data about exactl=
y how many people are using these editions.  So here is an attempt to provide=
 some real statistics on their use.
1.  Web statistics for edition use.
I have statistics dating back to last October (2012) for two substantial 'sch=
olarly digital editions' (to use Patrick Sahle's convenient description) onli=
ne:
a. Barbara Bordalejo's Origin of Species Variorum, http://darwin-online.org.u=
k/Variorum/
Over six months, this has had 2995 unique visitors (nearly 500 a month, or ar=
ound 16 a day), paying 3727 visits and looking at 15801 pages.  Maybe most in=
teresting: 280 of those visits accounted for nearly half of all page views, w=
ith 280 visits (about 1.5 a day) being longer than 10 minutes as the reader a=
ppeared to look at page after page.  To put this in perspective: one suspects=
 that more people have looked at this site, and used it intensively, than hav=
e used Peckham's printed Variorum in over fifty years.
b. The database/virtual library of books (mostly) printed in or about Japan b=
efore 1650, at http://laures.cc.sophia.ac.jp/laures/start/
Over six months, this has had 1935 unique visitors (over 300 a month, or arou=
nd 10 a day), paying 3494 visits and looking at 27070 pages.  Maybe most inte=
resting: 441 of those visits accounted for well over half of all page views, =
with 441 visits (over two a day) being longer than 10 minutes as the reader a=
ppeared to look at page after page.
2.  Statistics for CD-ROM/DVD/internet sales.
Here are the figures for digital editions, etc, sold by Scholarly Digital Edi=
tions since 2001:PublicationDateCopies sold (approx)Hengwrt Chaucer Digital Facsimile25/10/2000320Bayeux Tapestry Digital Edition31/10/20022500Hengwrt Chaucer Standard Edition3/11/200380Caxton's Canterbury Tales8/10/2003150Miller's Tale5/5/2004110Parliament Rolls of Medieval England5/5/2005560Nun's Priest's Tale3/5/200670Monarchia3/5/200660Leiden Armenian Lexical Textbase (internet)21/2/200836Canterbury Tales Digital Catalogue10/5/201016Commedia1/12/201016
(This will appear in an article in the next few months).  In addition to thes=
e figures:
61 internet access licences have been sold to institutions for the Parliament=
 Rolls, and some 10 individual online licences.
Some points emerge from this.  First, these figures very strongly support Dot=
 Porter's observation, that digital editions of historical materials have ach=
ieved far more use than of literary materials.  Our runaway bestsellers, the =
Parliament Rolls and Bayeux Tapestry, have done far better than our literary =
materials.  The exception appears to be the Hengwrt Chaucer -- but that is, w=
e suspect, used much more to teach about manuscripts than to teach Chaucer.  =
The very few copies sold of the Commedia is sobering: this is probably our ou=
tstanding publication, in terms of sheer scholarly weight, and yet has sold v=
ery few copies.Overall: the figures suggest that for literary works, there is much more eage=
rness on the part of editors to make scholarly editions in digital form than =
there is of readers, to read them.  However, the success of our historical pu=
blications (and of the online publications noticed above) shows that without =
doubt, there is no reluctance to use digital materials online, or in CD-ROM/D=
VD-ROM, per se.  The problem with lack of enthusiasm for digital editions of =
literary works is not, we have to conclude, because they are digital.well, make what you will of this
PeterAm 17.03.2013 18:28, schrieb Patrick Sahle:Dear all,Scholarly Digital Editing? I've just published three volumes on this topic:
    http://www.i-d-e.de/schriften/s7-9-digitale-editionsformenrough translation of titles:
    Digital Scholarly Editing
        Part I: The legacy of typography
        Part II: Survey, theory and methodology
        Part III: Notions of text and textual encoding- the distinction between digitized and digital scholarly editions (DSE) is a=
n important aspect in the definition of scholarly digital editions (SDE); see=
 most recently http://prezi.com/mdt8efbe3o3a/patrick-sahle-what-is-a-scholarl=
y-digital-edition/ (hope to elaborate on that in a forthcoming article); the =
main point here is, that there is a fundamental paradigm shift in thinking th=
e scholarly edition in a typographic setting or in a digital information envi=
ronment- should we make a distinction between digital scholarly editions (DSE) and s=
cholarly digital editions (SDE) ?
    - yes, because it describes two different processes or at least different=
 accentuations
        - DSE emphasizes that we still follow the idea of scholarly editing b=
ut transform it to the digital world
        - SDE emphasizes the relation to other forms of digital publishing wh=
ich are augmented by the dimension of scholarly criticism
    - no, because it should lead to the same results: editions that are truly=
 scholarly AND truly digital- is the edition its content or its presentation?
    - if the presentation is arbitrarily generated from underlying data, then=
 it has some logic to say, that the data is the edition. On the other hand th=
is would not fit well to the common notion of an "edition" as some form of pu=
blication. I think, a SDE must comprise both: the data and some form of publi=
cation of that data. What constitutes a particular edition is the definition =
of its subject together with a personal or institutional creatorship (or resp=
onsibility). Edition of X by Y. The edition may then have different forms of =
presentation (online, print, eBook, relaunched online version after some time=
), which may also be "versions".- do we really have a problem with the acceptance of digital editions?
    - first, I take up, what Andrew wrote...
        - "Compared to a printed book, they're miserable to read, since they =
tend to be designed first for technical analysis, and any attention to typogr=
aphy is typically a very low priority"
            - I'm not sure whether I'd agree on that. I find most SDEs quite =
readable. But yes, we're still in the incunabula age of digital texts. Good d=
igital typography still has to evolve. Anyway, I'call a lot of the editions l=
isted in my catalog "readable": http://digitale-edition.de/
        - "There's no guarantee in many cases that citations made from digita=
l editions will be stable."
            - but this is a known problem which we discuss for at least ten y=
ears now. And the solutions are quite clear: PID/PURL-systems, fine granulari=
ty of adressable objects in editions, institutional committments for the long=
-term support of SDE, versioning etc etc
        - "It's far easier to put a good printed edition together than a good=
 digital edition, especially because of the lack of standard, user-friendly t=
ools."
            - true, but the underlying problem is that SDEs are far more comp=
lex than tradional edition (as regards content, methods, technical aspects) -=
 and that's why generic tools are so hard to build
        - "There is no standard way of presenting online critical editions (w=
hereas most printed texts are published in series that follow a style guide)."
            - important point that the community has to address; but I see th=
ese publications series coming up; just some arbitrary examples:  http://elec=
.enc.sorbonne.fr/ - http://www.sd-editions.com/index.html - http://www.hab.de=
/de/home/bibliothek/digitale-bibliothek-wdb/digitale-editionen.html - http://=
www.rc.umd.edu/editions/
        - "Delving into academic politics, publishers hate them and many univ=
ersities don't count digital projects toward tenure."
            - traditional publishers will not solve the problems of SDEs
            - academic interest groups are starting to deal with the problem =
of credibility of digital work (the German Historians Union has just set up a=
 working group on digital scholarship with a subgroup on crediting digital wo=
rk in tenure and promotion)
    - second: success on the reader's side can only be measured in comparison=
 to the success of traditional printed editions. In comparison to the fact th=
at those often had an extremly low circulation, were bought nearly exclusivel=
y by libraries ....
    - third: success on the side of the editors. We had 6 summer schools on s=
cholarly digital editing in the last 5 years (http://www.i-d-e.de/events-des-=
ide). All have been overbooked. I see fewer and fewer newly starting edition =
projects that don't have a digital component or basis. There is some pressure=
 from the funding bodies, that new projects and new editions have to be digit=
al. But change takes some time.Best, Patrick
