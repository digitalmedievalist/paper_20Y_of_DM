The Canterbury Tales Project (https://www.canterburytalesproject.org/) is see=
king curious and enthusiastic graduate students for funded research positions=
 at the MA and Ph.D. levels. If you are interested in Chaucer, Middle English=
 literature, manuscript culture, early print, textual scholarship, Humanities=
 Data or the Digital Humanities, we are interested in hearing from you. We ca=
n also consider other proposals related to our work.The Canterbury Tales Project is a long-standing digital editorial project wit=
h almost 30 years of history leading in the development of editions and innov=
ative methods for research and delivery.In February 2020, the project published the CantApp: General Prologue, which =
has been downloaded more than 70.000 times since its release. The CTP also de=
fines the cutting edge of textual research: we use an integrated digital edit=
ing platform (Textual Communities) and bioinformatics software to study and a=
nalyze the textual tradition of the Tales. Although the project's mai=
n aim is to reach a better understanding of the textual tradition of the Cant=
erbury Tales, we also seek to discover and implement better ways of deliverin=
g complex information.The project was recently awarded a five-year $330,000 Insight Grant by the So=
cial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and is associate with=
 several other recently funded projects in Digital Humanities at the Universi=
ty of Lethbridge, the University of Calgary and the University of Saskatchewa=
n. This allows us to offer funding for Ph.D. and MA candidates to work with u=
s at the University of Lethbridge and the possibility of co-supervision arran=
gements through the University of Calgary and/or the University of Saskatchew=
an).What we want:
We seek students interested in researching combined aspects of the Canterbury=
 Tales, manuscript studies, digital research methods, digital humanities and =
Open Science. You are a curious and enthusiastic research student who will ta=
ke an active role in the project while carrying out your individual line of r=
esearch. You want to work as part of a team and contribute to the lab=E2=80=
=99s research environment. You believe in open science and open data publishe=
d under FAIR principles.
Your interests might be:
Chaucer
Middle English Literature
Manuscript Culture
Early Printed Books
Textual Scholarship
Open Data
Digital Humanities=E2=80=A6
...but we are open to considering other proposals.We will be particularly interested in discussing ideas beyond traditional tex=
tual criticism and attuned to areas of research expanding the canon and conve=
ntional views of the text of Chaucer. If you have an innovative critical appr=
oach, we want to hear from you.What we offer:
We are offering funding for a Ph.D. or M.A. within a lively and diverse worki=
ng environment. You will learn from peers and project leaders in the framewor=
k of our lab, where you can learn about all aspects of the project and its ma=
nagement while sharing in the lab's collaborative and interdisciplina=
ry research environment. Our project works closely with several other well-fu=
nded Digital Humanities and Open Science projects at the University including=
 work on Indigenous languages, Scholarly Communication, and Open Data. The Un=
iversity has a number of innovative cross-disciplinary programmes, including =
Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (which takes an interdisciplinary app=
roach to problems in the Humanities and Social Sciences) and a new Data Scien=
ces programme, which is developing an approach that will span the Sciences, S=
ocial Sciences, and Humanities.
