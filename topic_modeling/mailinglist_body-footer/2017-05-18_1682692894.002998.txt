the University of Rochester that is now named "Rochester Cultural Heritage
Imaging, Visualization, and Education" ("R-CHIVE") will be holding a small
conference on 6/19-20th (6/19 at RIT, Tuesday 6/20 at the UR). The
conference is intended to stimulate interest in the growing and important
field of imaging to recover cultural heritage. The general areas of focus
of the conference are best practice for imaging of cultural heritage and
how studies of materials (parchment, papyrus, and ink) can help in the
imaging and image processing. Confirmed speakers include Ira Rabin of
Federal Institute for Material Research and Testing in Berlin and the
Center for the Studies of Manuscript Cultures at the University of Hamburg,
Chet Van Duzer, NEH-Mellon Fellow at the U.S. Library of Congress, and
Michael Phelps of the Early Manuscripts Electronic Library.Everyone who is interested in the field is invited to attend. The
conference has a small registration fee of $10 for students and $30 for
faculty and staff to cover costs. Register at the "Conference" tab at
www.r-chive.netFeel free to contact Helen Davies (hdavies2(a)ur.rochester.edu )  with any
questions.For a sneak peak of the kind of things we will be discussing at the
