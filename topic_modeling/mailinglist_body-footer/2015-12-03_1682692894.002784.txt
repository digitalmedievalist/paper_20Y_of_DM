information on small and large collections. My point of interest was 
what happens to small digital (manuscript) collections (running their 
own web sites or portals) when they get aggregated into some large 
collection or digital library. How does this double modus vivendi look 
like with regard to the visibility of the original small collection, 
once aggregated into the large one?The examples (that you helped me to collect) prove that the answer to 
this question is not straightforward and unambiguous at all. There is a 
range of practices how the web-design of the large collection represents 
the original data and how it redirects (or not) the user to the original 
collection.To give an example, The European Library and Europeana seem to be two 
similar large aggregators. But in fact, there is a serious difference: 
The European Library strives to represent only the minimal metadata and 
a small informative thumb picture of the primary material, where the 
links to the original collection are visibly exposed to the user, who is 
graphically "encouraged" to visit the original contributor. In my view, 
this is an example of fair balance between the interests of the 
aggregator and the contributor. If we have a look to the same material 
in Europeana, on the other hand, we find that the interface is designed 
rather to retain the user on the Europeana pages: it gives a bigger 
image and the user is "warned" that he/she will leave the Europeana 
pages (the link to the original collection is labelled "View item at 
..."). Examples from other areas -- e.g. language technologies -- reveal 
even more drastic conflicts. In the area of manuscript studies however, 
in my opinion, MESA is by far the best aggregator. In the search-results 
area, a small "card" with metadata and a thumb-image invite the user to 
go deeper, and by one click, we come to the original collection.In the field of Digital Humanities, there are "small" and "big players", 
as we can call them. This is inevitable. Often, the big players are big 
because they manage to attract and aggregate many small players. Yet, is 
is true that the detail, analysis, commentary -- most of what in 
Humanities constitutes the "quality" -- is provided by the small 
players, while the big players, on the contrary, provide evidence, 
quantity, and infrastructure. The two roles are profoundly different, 
clearly. The rules which should govern a "fair aggregation", however, 
are not so clear. Hopefully, good practise will establish them.Regards,
Matija Ogrin
