the Spring issue of DM, which is currently being mounted on the server 
and should be available after proofing by the end of next week. In 
alphabetical order:Arianna Ciula, "Digital palaeography: using the digital representation 
of medieval script to support palaeographic analysis"  andKevin Kiernan, "The Source of the Napier Fragment of Alfred's Boethius" 
(which I know Dot is familiar with).Ciula's article is the closest in relevance: it describes a quantitative 
  approach to describing letterforms using a software tool, the System 
for Paleographic Inspections (SPI). In fact it discusses the question of 
(qualitative and quantitative) paleographic description directly and has 
a nice bibliography.Kiernan's article is less directly concerned with description, but (to 
simplify greatly) uses imaging software to assess the authenticity of 
the Old English "Napier Fragment". It also has a nice bibliography
