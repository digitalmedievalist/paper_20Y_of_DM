Medieval Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age: 16â€“21 February 2009The Institute of English Studies (London) is pleased to announce a new
AHRC-funded course in collaboration with the University of Cambridge,
the Warburg Institute, and King's College London.The course involves six days of intensive training on the analysis,
description and editing of medieval manuscripts in the digital age to be
held jointly in Cambridge and London. Participants will receive a solid
theoretical foundation and hands-on experience in cataloguing and
editing manuscripts for both print and digital formats.The first three days involve morning classes and then visits to
libraries in Cambridge and London in the afternoons. Participants will
view original manuscripts and gain practical experience in applying the
morning's themes to concrete examples. The final three days focus on
cataloguing and describing manuscripts in a digital format with
particular emphasis on the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). These three
days will also combine theoretical principles and practical experience
and include supervised work on computers.The course is free of charge and open to all arts and humanities
doctoral students registered at UK institutions. It is principally
aimed at those writing dissertations which relate to medieval
manuscripts, especially those on literature, art and history. Priority
will be given to PhD students funded by the AHRC. Class sizes are
limited to twenty and places are 'first-come-first-served' so early
registration is strongly recommended.For further details see http://ies.sas.ac.uk/study/mmsda/ or contact the 
course organisers at mmsda(a)sas.ac.uk.
