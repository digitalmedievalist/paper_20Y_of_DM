Best, Marjorie/////////////////////////////////////////////////////British Library summer internship 2010 (two months)The British Library has started digitising its medieval and earlier 
manuscript collections as part of its plans to make them all available 
to everyone online. The first volumes to be digitised are drawn from the 
Greek manuscript collections.To support this project, the British Library wishes to recruit an 
undergraduate or postgraduate intern to work on the TEI XML markup of 
over 600 Classical, Biblical and Byzantine manuscripts in Greek. The 
existing descriptions are available as MS Word documents and need to be 
converted into TEI-compliant XML code. Authority-list entries for 
authors, scribes and titles of works will be generated from the XML code 
and will need to be edited, looked up in other resources provided, and 
linked accordingly.
The intern will be supervised by Dr Juan Garces who manages the Greek 
Manuscripts Digitisation Project.Requirements
Essential:
The right to live and work in the UK (The British Library is unable to 
apply for a work visa for this internship). Undergraduate or postgraduate.
Good knowledge of XML and a basic understanding of the TEI guidelines. 
Experience of editing XML.
Fluent in written and spoken English.
Good time-management and organisational skills.
Desirable:
Experience of Greek/Byzantine Studies and working with manuscripts.
Familiarity with the Oxygen XML editor.
Able to work using own initiative.Terms
Two month internship, ideally starting late June 2010.
Pay: £6 per hour, 36 hours per week.How to apply
Please email your CV, including the names and contact details of two 
referees, and a covering letter explaining why you wish to undertake 
this internship and how your skills and experience match the 
requirements to claire.breay(a)bl.uk (Claire Breay, Head of Medieval and 
Earlier Manuscripts, The British Library) by 17:00 on Wednesday 26 May
