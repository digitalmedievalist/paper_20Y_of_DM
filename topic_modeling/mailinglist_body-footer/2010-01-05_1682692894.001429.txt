time for me to fix some minor details :) I'll keep the list posted as 
soon as they are available.

Yes indeed, the span of image was probably a bit too large for comfort 
on smaller screens in this exercise. On the other hand, the "zoom" of 
the current zone is always visible (but I agree it's useful to have the 
"big picture" to decipher a word) ; another trick might be to hide the 
lines of the transcription box when one has finished to transcribe them 
(not only the full zones can be hidden, but within the zones each line 
can also be hidden by clicking on its label).Best, Marjorie--
