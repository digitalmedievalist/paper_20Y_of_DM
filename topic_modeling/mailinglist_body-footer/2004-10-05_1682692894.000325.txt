<xsl:stylesheet version = '1.0'
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
     xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
 
<xsl:output method="xml" doctype-public="-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 
Transitional//EN"            
doctype-system="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"/>
 
<xsl:template match="/">
  <xsl:copy-of select="."/>
</xsl:template>
 
 
</xsl:stylesheet>then your entities should all get converted to UTF-8 automagically.PeterDaniel O'Donnell wrote:> Digital Medievalist Journal (Inaugural Issue Fall 2004). Call for
