en 750 and 1500 words on any aspect of digital humanities, from information t=
echnology to problems in humanities research and teaching. We welcome submiss=
ions particularly relating to interdisciplinary work and on new developments =
in the field, and we encourage submissions relating in some way to the theme =
of the 2012 conference, which is 'Digital Diversity: Cultures, languages and =
methods'.=20With the Digital Diversity theme in mind, we especially invite submissions fr=
om scholars representing emerging digital humanities communities, scholars in=
 the digital arts and music, in spatial history, and in the public humanities=
. The conference web site is at http://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/ and will be=
 developing over the next few weeks. The program committee aims for a varied =
program and for that reason will normally not accept multiple submissions fro=
m the same author or group of authors for presentation at the conference.=20Proposals might, for example, relate to the following aspects of digital huma=
nities:research on data mining, information design and modelling, software studies, =
and humanities research enabled through the digital medium;=20computer-based research and computer applications in literary, linguistic, cu=
ltural and historical studies, including electronic literature, public humani=
ties, and interdisciplinary aspects of modern scholarship. Some examples migh=
t be text analysis, corpora, corpus linguistics, language processing, languag=
e learning;
=09
the digital arts, architecture, music, film, theatre, new media, digital game=
s, and related areas;the creation and curation of humanities digital resources;the role of digital humanities in academic curricula.In the spirit of the conference theme, and in consultation with the ADHO Stan=
ding Committee on Multilingualism & Multiculturalism (MLMC), we particularly =
invite proposals on the potential and impact of digital methods and models in=
 fostering multilingualism and multiculturalism, and on the challenges and po=
tential presented to DH in terms of linguistic and cultural diversity. Propos=
als regarding endangered, lesser-known or minority languages and cultures are=
 especially welcome, as are case studies demonstrating the successful integra=
tion of multilingualism and multiculturalism with digital methods. Selected p=
apers may be eligible for inclusion in future ADHO publications devoted to th=
e topic of multilingualism and multiculturalism.The range of topics covered by digital humanities can also be consulted in th=
e journal of the associations:  Literary and Linguistic Computing (LLC), Oxfo=
rd University Press.The deadline for submitting poster, short paper, long paper, and sessions pro=
posals to the Program Committee is November 1, 2011.  Since the deadline is f=
irm, we urge you to begin preparing your proposals before the submission form=
 is ready.  Presenters will be notified of acceptance by February 1, 2012.  T=
he electronic submission form will be available on the conference site at the=
 beginning of October 2011. See below for full details on submitting proposal=
s.  =20A separate call for pre-conferences and workshops will be issued by the Progr=
am Committee shortly.  In addition, proposals for non-refereed or vendor demo=
nstrations should be discussed directly with the local conference organizer, =
Jan Christoph Meister, as soon as possible.  His email address is jan-c-meist=
er(a)uni-hamburg.de. All other proposals should be submitted to the Program C=
ommittee through the aforementioned electronic submission form on the confere=
nce web site.=20For more information on the conference in general, please visit the conferenc=
e web site http://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/.II.  Types of ProposalsProposals to the Program Committee may be of four types:  (1) poster presenta=
tions; (2) short paper presentations; (3) long papers; and (4) sessions (eith=
er three-paper or panel sessions). =20
The type of submission preferred should be specified on the application; howe=
ver, the committee may accept the application in another category based on th=
e number of proposals and the nature of the abstracts.  In part this addresse=
s the incredible response to recent calls and in part recognizes that all app=
lications are refereed and that the types of presentations are therefore equa=
l in importance.=20Papers and posters may be given in English, French, German, Italian or Spanis=
h.=201)  Poster presentations =20Please submit an abstract of 750 to 1500 words.  Poster presentations may inc=
lude any work in progress on any topic of the call for papers as outlined abo=
ve, computer technology, project demonstrations, and software demonstrations.=
  Posters and software demonstrations are intended to be interactive, with th=
e opportunity of the presenter to exchange ideas one-on-one with attendees an=
d to discuss their work in detail with those most deeply interested in the sa=
me topic.  Presenters will be provided with board space to display their work=
, computer connections may be available, and presenters are encouraged to pro=
vide a URL, business card, or handouts with more detailed information. Poster=
s will be on display at various times during the conference, and a separate c=
onference session will be dedicated to them when presenters should be present=
 to explain their work and to answer questions.  Additional times may be assi=
gned for software or project demonstrations. Poster sessions may showcase som=
e of the most important and innovative work being done in the digital humanit=
ies.  In recognition of this, the Program Committee will award a prize for be=
st poster.=202)  Short papersThis is a new category of presentation, allowing for up to five short papers =
in a one-hour session, with the length held to a strict ten (10) minutes each=
 in order to allow time for one to two questions per paper.=20Short paper proposals (750 to 1500 words) are appropriate for reporting short=
er experiments; describing work in progress; and for describing newly conceiv=
ed tools or software in early stages of development.   At the behest of the P=
rogram Committee, short papers may be presented as both a short paper and as =
a poster session.  For research or projects further along in development, pre=
senters should consider applying for a long paper presentation.=203)  Long PapersProposals for long papers (750-1500 words) are for reporting substantial, com=
pleted, and previously unpublished research; the development of significant n=
ew methodologies or digital resources; and/or rigorous theoretical, speculati=
ve, or critical discussions.  Individual papers will be allocated twenty (20)=
 minutes for presentation and ten (10) minutes for questions.=20Proposals about the development of new computing methodologies or digital res=
ources should indicate how the methodologies are applied to research and/or t=
eaching in the humanities, what their impact has been in formulating and addr=
essing the research questions, and should include some critical assessment of=
 the application of those methodologies in the humanities.  Papers that conce=
ntrate on a particular application or digital resource in the humanities shou=
ld cite traditional as well as computer-based approaches to the problem and s=
hould include some critical assessments of the computing methodologies used. =
 All proposals should include relevant citations to sources in the literature=
.=204) Multiple Paper Sessions (90 minutes) are either:=20Three long papers.  The session organizer should submit a 500-word statement =
describing the session topic, include abstracts of 750-1500 words for each pa=
per, and indicate that each author is willing to participate in the session; =
or,A panel of four to six speakers.  The panel organizer should submit an abstra=
ct of 750-1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will be organized, th=
e names of all the speakers, and an indication that each speaker is willing t=
o participate in the session.=20The deadline for session proposals is the same as for proposals for papers, i=
.e. November 1, 2011.   =20Several points about the sessions papers:  papers that are submitted as parts=
 of special sessions may *not* also be submitted individually for considerati=
on in another category. Session proposers should justify bundling the three p=
apers into a special session, i.e., explaining the added value of the special=
 session as opposed to including the papers separately, particularly how the =
special session addresses the conference theme.III.  Format of the ProposalsAll proposals must be submitted electronically using the online submission fo=
rm, found at the conference web site at http://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de begi=
nning October 1, 2011.  Anyone who has previously used the confTool system to=
 submit proposal or reviews should use their existing account rather than set=
ting up a new one.  If anyone has forgotten their user name or password, plea=
se contact Paul Spence at paul.spence(a)kcl.ac.ukIV.  Information about the conference venueHamburg on the river Elbe has about 1.8 million inhabitants within the city l=
imits, making the
old Hanseatic merchant city Germany's second largest metropolis. Hamburg is c=
haracterized by its port, its international orientation and a cosmopolitan fl=
air.=20The University of Hamburg was founded in 1919. Today the Faculty of the Human=
ities is home to over 10,000 students. Since its inception Hamburg University=
 has maintained a strong focus on foreign languages and cultures. To foster a=
nd to explore such diversity is a key task of the Humanities - and to provide=
 theories, methods and tools to this end poses a particularly interesting cha=
llenge to the Digital Humanities. We hope you will join in the discussion on =
"Digital Diversity" at the DH2012 and look forward to seeing you in Hamburg!V.  Bursaries for young scholars A limited number of bursaries for young scholars will be made available to t=
hose presenting at the conference by the Association of Digital Humanities Or=
ganizations (ADHO).  Young scholars who wish to apply for a bursary will find=
 guidelines on the ADHO website http://www.digitalhumanities.org later this a=
utumn (roughly November 1st).=20More details will be issued about this subject in the next few weeks.VI.  International Program CommitteeSusan Brown (SDH-SEMI - Vice Chair)
