tools is have a degree of openness and a fair bit of documentation on
the process.  If in your documentation you spell out exactly how it
makes an identification, and what the limitations and assumptions of
the tool are, then in having a greater understanding of the software,
I'm likely to trust it more.  If your software source code is released
under an open licence and I can go and see how it works, and perhaps
more importantly in this kind of software, fiddle with the rules it
uses to ascertain a particular scribe or author so I can re-run it and
see the effect on a test suite sample texts, then that might make me
trust it more as well. So for me comprehensive user and technical
documentation, open source code and open sample data would make it
more trustworthy or usable.  Because I'm that naturally skeptical sort
of person, what wouldn't make me trust it more would be just
high-profile journal articles or well-respected luminaries going on
about how great it was.  (In fact, that would probably make me more
suspicious and curious as to how it worked underneath...)  Not sure if
that was the kind of answer you were looking for.-James
