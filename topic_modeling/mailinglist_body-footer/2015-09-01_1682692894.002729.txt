olabe=E2=80=9D as an
early technical document, yet few similar medieval texts have been
discussed as specimens of technical communication. This session seeks to
consider the traditions and conventions of medieval technical communication,
as well as the connections between medieval and contemporary technical
writing.Possible texts for consideration might include (but are not limited to)
penitential and conduct manuals, monastic rules, business correspondence,
medical treatises, scientific and pseudo-scientific manuals (including
alchemical and astrological ones), cookery books, law codes, and government
and military documents. Papers should consider the texts as technical
communication, but may focus either on any aspect, including writing,
layout, design, etc.Please send abstracts and participant information forms via e-mail to Wendy
Hennequin=E2=80=8B (mwhennequin(a)gmail.com) by September 15.Thanks,
Wendy
