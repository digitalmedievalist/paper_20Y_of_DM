using Git for version control, then I'd probably stick with something like
Google Drive because the learning curve is almost zero. I don't think I'd
go with Dropbox because is basically a file repository and you'd have to
look at the dates when files are modified to see if changes have been made.
Can you view the changes that were made to a file in Dropbox? I don't know.
In Google Drive you can see the changes, but is it good for code projects?
Not really. Have people written entire XML projects or any kind of code in
a Word doc? Yes, but it's not good practice. I haven't seen projects that
involved code using Dropbox or Google Drive because there are no mechanisms
in place to stop bad code from entering the system. That's why most
programmers use Git and that's why version control is not simply an
exercise in tracking the dates when changes were made. It's inevitable that
people will write bad code, but using a system that will allow you to
accept or reject changes is better than putting code into the system then
throwing your hands in the air when something goes wrong. Git shows you the
changes and allows for moderation before connecting it to the master code.I'd have to disagree with the comment that Git has a problem because it
does not work with users' expectations and/or is too complicated. I learned
it in a couple days. Just take a course on Code School for free. Millions
of programmers use Git and Github daily without problems. You just have to
follow certain steps in order to preserve good code and not push
potentially problematic code into your system.Saying that, if your students are working on digital humanities projects
and are coding, they should learn Git. It's an essential tool that
professionals use every day.On Tuesday, December 30, 2014, Stuart A. Yeates <syeates(a)gmail.com> wrote:> https://ifttt.com/ - IF This Then That. It's a tool for getting
