symposia and printed media to disseminate the fruits of their research. In
the last two decades, the Internet and the World Wide Web have made new
forms of publication possible. Electronic journals have been founded, such
as the Bryn Mawr Classical Review and the Medieval Review. Academic
websites, including De Imperatoribus Romanis, Perseus, Diotima, Electronic
Antiquity, ORB, Lacus Curtius, the Stoa, and the Medieval Sourcebook,
provide wide audiences with primary materials, scholarly studies, and access
to other resources. Search engines like Index Antiquus have been developed
to help navigate the rapidly multiplying opportunities of this new medium. In spite of these advances, the Internet is just beginning to fulfill its
potential as a scholarly medium. This conference will address various ways
in which the World Wide Web is being, and can be, developed, in the fields
of Classical, Medieval, and Byzantine studies. Participants are encouraged
to use their imaginations in considering different ways in which the WEB can
help to promote ancient and medieval studies. Presentations are not only of
a theoretical nature, but also of a practical, "how-to", nature.
