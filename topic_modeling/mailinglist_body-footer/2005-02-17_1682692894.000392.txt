Dear list members,
I=C2=B4m not sure if this is the right forum for such a query, but I=C2=B4m s=
ure
you will know if anyone does!  I=C2=B4ve found lots of on-line resources with
illutrations and descriptions of manuscripts. I=C2=B4d like to find an example
which I could use to illustrate, for the same text,
1) the manuscript itself
2) a diplomatic transcription
3) a normalized transcription
and (if possible)
4) a translation.
The point is to illustrate the various possibilities
to students who may not have thought about
manuscripts.
It strikes me that this sort of information is more likely to be on a=20
"teaching" website
(in paleography, perhaps?) than anywhere else. Any suggestions where I=20
should
start looking would be greatly appreciated!
