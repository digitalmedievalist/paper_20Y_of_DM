Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThanks for all the comments.  I am currently using Excel, but I may end 
up using
SPSS.  I've tried Access, and it's complicated trying to obtain statistical
information that I want which Excel seems to do with ease.To tell you the truth, what I am doing is calculating the number of formulaic
patterns and the number of punctuation marks in the Exeter Book.  It is quite
simple to look at all the information in Excel, but I cannot really compare
results from the formulaic patterns with the punctuation practises, since the
data is quite large and multidimensional. I think that Minitab would work well
from what I have been told, but I have no experience with this tool.Best,
A.
