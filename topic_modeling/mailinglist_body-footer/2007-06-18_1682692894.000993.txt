an interesting conference in addition to the usual posters, keynotes,
and member's business. There is one session on the markup of
manuscripts, for example.Also, we will be having a granting roundtable with representatives of
many of the major funding agencies: IMLS, NEH, NSF (U.S.), DFG
(Germany), almost certainly SSHRC (Canada) and possibly agencies from
the U.K. and EU. These will be discussing new directions in Digital
Humanities funding.This should be a very interesting event.-dan
