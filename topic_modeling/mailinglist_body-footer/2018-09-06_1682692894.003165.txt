Text as object in the Middle AgesCall for Papers - Leeds International Medieval Congress, 1-4 July 2019,
LeedsThe International Medieval Congress (IMC) is the largest medieval studies
conference in the world. More than 2,900 medievalists from more than 60
countries participated in the 25th annual International Medieval Congress
(IMC) from 2-5 July 2018.In line with the Special Thematic Strand in 2019 =E2=80=9CMaterialities=E2=80=
=9D (
https://www.leeds.ac.uk/ims/imc/imc2019_call.html) and the recent creation
of the strand =E2=80=9CManuscript studies=E2=80=9D, we organize sessions on *=
=E2=80=9CText as
object in the Middle Ages=E2=80=9D*. Texts, indeed, are at the same time an i=
dea
and a form. The latter is the result of a combination of inherited social
uses and specific intentions by the various actors involved in transmitting
the text as idea. This process begins with the authors, continues to the
craftsmen (parchment and paper makers, copyists and chancery clerks,
painters and illuminators, sculptors and weavers, booksellers=E2=80=A6) and t=
hen on
to possessors, readers, archives and libraries. All textual artefacts are
concerned: manuscripts, charters, inscriptions, tapestries, seals, coins,
etc.What scholars can study nowadays is however only one specific, if not
final, state of those manuscripts, documents and inscriptions, from which
they seek to reconstruct the respective intents of the actors. Under the
topic =E2=80=9CText as object in the Middle Ages=E2=80=9D, we intend to study=
 the interplay
of the original creation act, the possible transformations, and modern
scholarship, especially along the following lines: =E2=80=9Carchaeology of a
research concept=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cmateriality in scholarly editions=E2=80=
=9D, =E2=80=9Cgenre and
materiality=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cfragments=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cimaging technique=
s and physicochemical analysis=E2=80=9D-          *Archaeology of a research concept: awareness of materiality in
the 15th-19th centuries*Medieval library catalogues started including *dictiones probatoriae*
or *secundo
folio* as identifiers of a given manuscript as object rather than as the
bearer of a text; additional information on the physical appearance could
also be indicated (size of the script, illumination, =E2=80=A6). Cartularies =
and
registers, but also inventories, sometimes include a description of the
original charter, be it in a text form, be it as a  drawing (=E2=80=9Ccopie
figur=C3=A9e=E2=80=9D), also for elements which are no validation signs. Thes=
e are early
examples of an awareness of material aspects in textual artefacts.
=E2=80=9Cmateriality=E2=80=9D as a term is rather new in historiographical re=
search,
however there is a complex archaeology of this research concept applied to
texts. Starting in the Middle Ages, it became more prominent with the rise
of the =E2=80=9Cauxiliary sciences=E2=80=9D such as palaeography and diplomat=
ics in the 17th
and 18th century which were very much focused on the material aspects of
written objects. By the 19th century it found its way into the
bibliographic descriptions, either in a scholarly environment or in auction
and sales catalogues as part of a bibliophilic interest.This pre-historical time of =E2=80=9Cmateriality=E2=80=9D as a research conce=
pt is not well
known. We welcome proposals dealing with examples of a =E2=80=9Cmaterial=E2=
=80=9D approach
to manuscripts and documents in medieval and early modern times, and
evidencing the consequences of this past material concern on modern
scholarship (e.g. identification of well described manuscripts in past
collections vs. apparently lost collections).-          *Materiality in Scholarly Editions*When doing editorial work, scholars may take the materiality of the text
into account and either decide to discard their observations or communicate
them to the user. From imitative, so-called =E2=80=9Cdiplomatic=E2=80=9D edit=
ions to very
normalizing ones, several models coexist depending on editorial goals,
national traditions, text genres, or witness tradition with regard to the
nature of the textual work. Discussions of former editions and practices
are welcome, as well as proposals discussing the current developments in
scholarly editions. This could include reflections on the tensions
resulting from tight schedules due to fixed-term contracts and the ideal of
exhaustive material description and analysis.-          *Genre and materiality: literary genre and their influence on
layout, decoration, and scripts*The connection between text and object is reflected by specific
requirements for the written object in the fields of diplomatics,
epigraphy, codicology (layout, material structure), art history
(iconography, decoration), and palaeography (script types, abbreviations,
script size and degree of formality).Recurrent patterns in book production have already been identified, such as
books of hours and prayers for lay people being small in size, illustrated,
and written in long lines, or genealogies and universal histories being
written in scroll format in order to stress the continuity. There are also
illuminators working mainly in the production of one or two literary
genres, for whom it is not always possible to ascertained if it is a
consequence of being hired by one librarian or if they specialized into
specific iconographic types. Illuminated charters as a category may also be
connected with specific conditions in their creation.Connexions between script types and text genres also may be a medieval
reality uncovered by modern research (Beneventan/Caroline scripts depending
on genres) or a historiographical construct (such as the misleading =E2=80=9C=
gothic
liturgical script=E2=80=9D or Uncial as Christian script). In this regard, cu=
ltural
divide and contact zones (Beneventan, Wisigothic vs. Caroline; Humanistic
vs. Gothic) deserve special attention, as well as a further study of
=E2=80=9Cpragmatic literacy=E2=80=9D under the pragmatic aspect of writing.Medieval autographs form a cross-genre domain, in which the intervention of
the author may provide modern scholars with additional information. Yet,
only a reciprocal analysis of text and handwriting in their context should
allow the expertise of autography. Theoretical proposals and case studies
demonstrating how material (here mainly palaeographic) and textual
inquiries interact are welcome. Papers could focus on new results within these known patterns or new
connections between text and materiality.-          *Fragments and damaged text objects: an ex post decided layout
and format definition*Fragments are a challenging form to study manuscripts both as texts and
objects. They pose specific challenges for the identification of the
textual contents as well as the objects' origin and life. Proposals m=
ay
present innovative tools and projects, as well as scholarly research based
on virtual or physical reconstruction of dismembered or fragmentary text
objects. The organizers particularly welcome proposals dealing with the
fragment as source for the broader historical context (e.g. textual
history, reception and cultural transfers).-          *Imaging techniques and physicochemical analysis of medieval
text objects*The material analysis is not a new field any more. Imaging techniques
available for manuscript research include those based on physicochemical
properties (multispectral, X-ray fluorescence, etc.) as well as those that
allow a better perception of the object (Reflectance Transformation
Imaging, 3D scan). Recent technological advances now allow a better
coordination of textual studies,imaging and physicochemical research.
Examples include the Archimedes palimpsest, the manuscripts from Mount
Sinai or the rolls from Herculanum and Ein Gedi. For this session we expect
proposals illustrating how material analyses or imaging techniques can
reveal hidden or illegible text layers and therefore have a direct impact
on our understanding of the textual content and its history.Papers of 20 minutes in length are invited. To propose a paper, please send
a brief abstract (250 words max) to=C2=B7         dominique.stutzmann(a)irht.cnrs.fr=C2=B7         katharina.kaska(a)univie.ac.at=C2=B7         sebastien.barret(a)cnrs-orleans.fr=C2=B7         paul.bertrand(a)uclouvain.be=C2=B7         christoph.egger(a)univie.ac.at=C2=B7         georg.vogeler(a)uni-graz.atThe deadline for receipt of submissions is 25th September 2018.
