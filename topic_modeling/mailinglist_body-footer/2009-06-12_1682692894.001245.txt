Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableHi all,A note from Larry Swain. The new issue has a contribution from your=20
humble correspondent that is based in part on a discussion we had on=20
this list some time ago about the essential skills we need as humanists=20
in the digital age.The Editorial Board of <i>The Heroic Age</i> is very pleased to announce=20
the publication of our twelfth issue. Point your browsers to=20
http://www.heroicage.org <http://www.heroicage.org> and click on=20
"Current Issue." Information elsewhere on the site has also been updated=20
including the staff, links pages, and the Call for Papers. Please take a=20
look; comments are always welcome. I have taken the liberty of pasting=20
below the Letter from the Editor which has some items of interest in it.=C2=A71. Sumer is icumen in! Or so said the poet, in agreement with the=20
weather prognosticators for once. It is both a frustration and an=20
embarrassment that the Winter issue is seeing the light of day as summer=20
is fast approaching, but regrettably that is too often the state of=20
affairs in academic publishing. But it isn't for lack of trying.=C2=A72. So, I'd like to begin by mentioning the important people who=20
volunteer their time to make The Heroic Age happen each issue. First,=20
and foremost, there are three people who work very hard to make each=20
issue come together, edited, polished, and coded. Deanna Forsman, our=20
webster, formats and codes each page on our website, including each=20
issue, taking time from her own academic duties and courses, family, and=20
leisure to do so. Without her efforts, there would be no The Heroic Age.=20
Eileen Joy has done an enormous amount of work for the journal. Not only=20
is she now editing a column for us, but she has been a reader, an=20
editor, and copy editor. It is not as if she is not busy elsewhere: in=20
addition to her work for us, she has been editing volumes of essays=20
(http://www.siue.edu/babel/ProspectusFragmentsVolume.htm=20
<http://www.siue.edu/babel/ProspectusFragmentsVolume.htm>), putting=20
together a new journal (www.palgrave-journals.com/pmed/), blogging at In the Middle=20
(www.inthemedievalmiddle.com), and other activities. I am very grateful=20
for all her efforts with The Heroic Age. Last but certainly not least,=20
Bill Schipper is our archivist and is another of those wonderful people=20
whose helping hand is everywhere. In addition to his work with us, Bill=20
is planning and hosting the next meeting of The International Society of=20
Anglo-Saxonists, hosts and manages several well-known email lists in=20
early Medieval Studies, and of course has his own work to undertake. My=20
very grateful thanks to each of these three for their very hard work on=20
my behalf.=C2=A73. In addition to those three, others have had a hand in producing this=
=20
issue who should be mentioned: Rolf Bremer, Tim Clarkson, Michael=20
Treschow, Linda Malcor, Rolf Bremmer, Dan O'Donnell, and Michel Aaij=20
have all undertaken editing at several levels. Finally, I will mention=20
our readers, who will remain nameless for obvious reasons, but they know=20
who they are. The only reward I can offer all these people is my sincere=20
gratitude. If you have a moment whether via email or at a conference,=20
please say "thanks" to these folk who have made this issue possible.=C2=A74. Before turning to the issue itself, there are some exciting=20
developments in connection with the links pages hosted at the journal's=20
site. For this issue, the Anglo-Saxon links have been culled, weeded,=20
and expanded. Ten years ago, in winter 1999, when I first split the=20
Anglo-Saxon links off into their own subpage, I had grand plans to do=20
the same for other subfields within the journal's purview. While it=20
won't make it for Issue 12, there is at least one subsection and=20
possibly two in development that will make debut appearances in Issue 13.=C2=A75. More importantly, and in my view far more exciting, is a new=20
development for some older but useful tools. As many know, the Richard=20
Rawlinson Center at the Medieval Institute=20
(http://www.wmich.edu/medieval <http://www.wmich.edu/medieval>) of=20
Western Michigan University once hosted several online bibliographies=20
and other projects that covered a range of subjects in Early Medieval=20
Studies. A few years ago, some decisions were made that caused the=20
removal of these tools from the Richard Rawlinson Center website, at=20
that time intended to be a temporary situation. Several years later,=20
however, the bibliographies remain inaccessible to the medieval=20
researcher. These bibliographies are now in the process of being=20
migrated to The Heroic Age site and will be linked off the HA links=20
pages. There are many to thank for these developments. First, and=20
foremost, Paul E. Szarmach, now Director of the Medieval Academy of=20
America (http://www.medievalacademy.org=20
<http://www.medievalacademy.org>), James M. Murray and Elizabeth=20
Teviotdale of the Medieval Institute, and Bill Schipper and the good=20
folks at Memorial University of Newfoundland (http://www.mun.ca=20
<http://www.mun.ca>) are all owed a deep debt of gratitude for allowing=20
this to happen and making the migration possible. As of this writing,=20
the first such bibliography, Robert Fulk and Kari Ellen Gade's online=20
edition of A Bibliography of Germanic Alliterative Meters, is almost=20
ready to go to its new home and may be included in Issue 12's update=20
links release.=C2=A76. Turning to our regular features for this issue, I would like to draw=
=20
your attention to a new column: Philological Inquiry written by Michael=20
Drout and Scott Kleinman. The plan is for this to be a recurring column=20
on philological approaches to the field. This first foray examines the=20
word "Merovingian" in Beowulf in order to "illuminate culture, history=20
and politics and shed new light on an old problem." Please join me in=20
welcoming Mike and Scott and this new contribution to our columns.=C2=A77. Eileen Joy has edited a second offering in our still new "babelisms"=
=20
column. The column is devoted to publishing essays that explore=20
convergences between early medieval and modern texts and ideas. In this=20
issue's column, Helen T. Bennett offers a meditation on halls in=20
Beowulf: "The Postmodern Hall in Beowulf: Endings Embedded in Beginnings."=C2=A78. In Michel Aaij's Continental Business column, Michel reviews and=20
discusses recent scholarly works on Rabanus Maurus, and Dan O'Donnell=20
returns as columnist of Electronic Medievalia with "Byte me:=20
Technological Education and the Humanities." This rounds out our=20
recurring columns.=C2=A79. Elsewhere in this issue's Forum, Jonathan Jarrett, well-known to=20
many as the blogger behind A Corner of Tenth Century Europe=20
(http://tenthmedieval.wordpress.com=20
<http://tenthmedieval.wordpress.com>) and author of the forthcoming=20
Pathways of Power in late-Carolingian Catalonia: Charters and=20
Connections on a medieval frontier from the Royal Historical Society,=20
contributes to our ongoing series about current developments in=20
subfields of medieval studies. He offers us "Digitizing Numismatics:=20
getting the Fitzwilliam Museum's coins to the world-wide web." As this=20
issue's installment of our series introducing projects in the field,=20
Margaret Cormack introduces us to her site and asks for readers' aid in=20
a column titled "Saints and Sacred Space: An Interactive Database=E2=80=94A C=
all=20
for Collaborators." Howard Wiseman offers a review essay on a fiction=20
novel, Albion. Finally, Cullen Chandler offers a review essay discussing=20
several recent books on things Carolingian in his contribution titled=20
"Regna et Regnum: Studies of Regions within the Carolingian Empire."=C2=A710. We have three excellent articles in this issue. Karmen Lenz=20
examines the liturgy for St. Cuthbert in her Liturgical Readings of the=20
Cathedral Office for Saint Cuthbert. This is followed by Douglas Simms=20
who contributes an article focused on linguistics titled Heavy=20
Hypermetrical Foregrounding in the Old Saxon Heliand and Genesis Poems.=20
Rounding out the General Article section is a team-sponsored article=20
titled King Alfred's Scholarly Writings and the Authorship of the First=20
Fifty Prose Psalms by Michael Treschow, Paramjit Gill, and Tim B. Swartz=20
that examines the attribution of these psalms to Alfred. These three=20
very solid and interesting articles complete the issue.=C2=A711. Looking ahead, Issue 13 is already well under way. Originally=20
imagined as an issue to focus on medieval manuscripts, as it turns out,=20
the issue will instead focus on translations from early medieval texts!=20
Nonetheless, the issue will also include articles on Old Norse, Hincmar,=20
and Arthur plus our usual columns.=C2=A712. Issue 14 is in development as well. Its a twin-themed issue=20
guest-edited by Andrew Rabin and Eileen Joy. Andrew is collecting and=20
editing a group of essays on Early Medieval Law. Eileen has gathered and=20
is editing a number of essays on the topic of theory and early medeival=20
literature. I myself enjoy the juxtaposition of a traditional topic with=20
a more cutting-edge, perhaps even edgeless topic and placing these in=20
conversation. If all goes well, this issue should be published in early=20
2010.=C2=A713. The Heroic Age will celebrate its first decade in 2010. We formed=20
the board in late 1999 and published our inaugural issue in Spring 2000,=20
imagined then as appearing quarterly. That first issue was all about=20
Arthur. Our fifteenth issue is scheduled to be published in mid-2010 and=20
is seeking papers on "Arthur-related" topics, revisiting the edges of=20
that first issue. The three sections currently planned for that issue=20
will cover the world of Late Antique Britain and Gaul, connections with=20
the rest of the continent in Late Antiquity, and new views of the=20
Adventus Saxonum. The second section will examine Arthur and Arthurian=20
literature. The third section will include studies of Late Antique and=20
Early Medieval authors.=C2=A714. Even further ahead, Issue 16 is already gathering papers. A special=
=20
section on Alcuin is being guest-edited by James LePree. Issues 17 and=20
18 are in the planning stages as well. One will be guest-edited by=20
Jonathan Jarrett, mentioned above, on "Carolingian Border-lands" and=20
Issue 18 will focus on Old French/Provencal/Occitan studies. That takes=20
the editorial planning up through the beginning of 2012.=C2=A715. As always, feedback is appreciated. I now turn you over to the=20
issue itself, lest this note become as long as what it introduces! On=20
behalf of the editorial board, our readers, and editors, I hope you the=20
reader enjoy the issue.
