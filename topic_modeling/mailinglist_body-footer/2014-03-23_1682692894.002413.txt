Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Klaus and list,Thank you for the updated URLs, and I apologise for the e-mails about old pro=
jects which have just been posted to the list. We are in the process of recon=
figuring the DM infrastructure, and a slip-up during this has meant that some=
 pages from the old DM wiki were sent to the list by mistake. We believe that=
 the problem is now fixed, and we will send out more information about the ne=
w infrastructure shortly.Best wishes,Peter Stokes (Director, DM)
