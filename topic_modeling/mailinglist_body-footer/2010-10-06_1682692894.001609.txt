in a book on a Kindle that (apparently) has no pages or paragraph=20
numbers, what does she do? She says Kindle has something called=20
"locations" but it isn't clear to me if these are canonical or more like=20
arbitrary bookmarks from how she is describing them (I don't have any=20
ereaders, and so don't know).Anybody know what you are supposed to do? I guess she could count=20
paragraphs if it was that important, or, as with a very long webpage,=20
just skip providing a location more precise than the entire work on the=20
theory that you could full-text-search for it.-dan--=20
