Subject: [PhillyDigitalHumanities] GLAM Hack Philly - Feb 1-2, 2014
To: phillydh <phillydigitalhumanities(a)googlegroups.com>
   GLAM Hack Philly is a free, weekend-long hackathon focused on building
apps with open data from Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums. It
will take place the weekend of February 1-2, 2012 at the University of
Pennsylvania's Kislak Center for Special Collections.The event will bring together programmers, curators, librarians, designers,
archivists, and anyone else with a passion for GLAM data, to build fun and
interesting apps with the tremendous amount of GLAM data that is openly and
freely available. On the morning of Saturday, February 1st, participants
can pitch ideas for projects related to a specific data set or for broader
GLAM-related applications. This could be anything from creating Omeka
plug-ins to building a virtual city tour app using local digital
collections. Small groups will form and participants will begin working on
their projects through Sunday, with a goal to present a working prototype
by Sunday afternoon.
Challenges and DataWe are seeking proposals of Data Challenges for teams to work on during the
hackathon. Challenges can be as simple as a dataset and a vague idea of
what could be done with that data, or could be an already identified
problem with your data that you are seeking help to solve.The only requirements for proposing a challenge are:   -   Someone from your organization commits to participating in the event.
   They will help steward teams who take up that challenge by giving context
   to your data.
   -   If you r challange includes a dataset, that data should be made
   available for use and reuse. Providing your data openly means that anyone
   can build applications with your data before, during, and after the
   hackathon.
Submit a Challenge Now <http://bit.ly/1bp5xpV>If you're not sure how your organization's data could be used or want=
 some
help brainstorming a challenge, just get in touch with
glamhackphilly(a)gmail.com <javascript:_e({}, 'cvml',
'glamhackphilly(a)gmail.com');>, we're happy to help.You can also submit your dataset without proposing a
challenge<http://bit.ly/1cg6bEr>.
We'll highlight your dataset on our website for attendees consideration.But I'm not a programmer -- can I participate?The input of content specialists like museum curators, librarians,
archivists, catalogers,GLA researchers and others who know the data
produced by GLAM organizations, is crucial to creating successful projects.
We don't just want your participation, we need it!You can find more information on http://glamhack.comThanks,
Philly GLAM Hack organizers --
