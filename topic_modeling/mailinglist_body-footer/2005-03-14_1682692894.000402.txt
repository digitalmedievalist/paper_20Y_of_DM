Some readers may be interested in an AHDS information paper that we have 
recently released.  It was written by Thijs van den Broek as part of his 
technical report on the possibilities of Benchmarking XML-editors.http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/information-papers/xml-editors/It is a highly subjective report and really concerns the perceived 
usability of the editors by different groups of people.My preferred editors are tei-emacs and oXygen, by the way.-James--
