Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThanks very much for prompt and helpful replies. I'm off skiing today, 
and so can't try the various suggestions out until this evening, but 
they look pretty right. They certainly diagnosed missing elements in my 
sheets.To sum up:The problem I was having involved additional material being put in my 
output (namespaces, extra lines of meta information) and the stripping 
out of the solidus in empty elements (e.g. <br> for expected <br/>).The solutions (I'm pretty sure they will work) involved1) specifying xhtml or xml as my output, e.g.<xsl:output method="xml"
            encoding="UTF-8"
            doctype-public="-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
 
doctype-system="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"
            omit-xml-declaration="yes"/>2) if necessary, using the <xsl:element> element instead of plain text 
for entering the xhtml tagging.
Again, thanks.-dan--
