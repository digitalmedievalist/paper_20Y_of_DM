Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThe newest version of the Junicode font adds the Gothic range 
(U+10330-1034A) in all four faces. The original Gothic added in 0.7.4 
has been moved to the bold face. In regular the Gothic now harmonizes 
with the rest of the face. The two italic faces have skewed versions of 
the regular and bold. OpenType features in all four faces automatically 
handle transliteration from Latin to Gothic and Gothic to Latin. If you 
work with Gothic at all, have a look and tell me what you think. This 
feature isn't for everyone, but I've really enjoyed adding it.Peter Baker
