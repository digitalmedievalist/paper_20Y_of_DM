Medieval manuscripts will be discussed!***http://www.rarebookschool.org/globaldigitallibraries/Global Digital LibrariesA symposium sponsored by Rare Book School, the Scholars' Lab, and the
Buckner W. Clay Endowment for the Humanities at the Institute of the
Humanities & Global CultureUniversity libraries and humanities centers are shifting many resources
toward the development of digital libraries and archives, intended to
foster scholarly research in networks that span both national and financial
borders. Large-scale projects along these lines, such as Europeana and the
Digital Public Library of America, have developed out of academic
discussions and endeavors initiated by professors and librarians. At the
same time, large-scale, international, collaborative initiatives present
new organizational challenges for humanities departments and research
libraries alike. This symposium will explore and critique the kinds of
models that have emerged for building global digital libraries, and the
kinds of comparative research that have been made possible through them.The symposium is intended for digital humanists from departments throughout
the UVA community and beyond, and is designed to contribute to UVA's
strategic planning and development of ongoing and emerging global projects
to digitize and interpret collections. The symposium will also foster
collaborative relationships among UVA and other research centers that are
helping to form global digital libraries.
