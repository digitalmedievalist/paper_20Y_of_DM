in Paris where a regular visitor to the Vatican Library pronounced that the
Vatican would NEVER digitize, much less release in any way, their
manuscript collection.   A little over a year later, I sat in a meeting
with the Vice-Prefect of the Vatican LIbrary where he outlined their plans
to begin digitizing the collection.I was shocked that even these images have been made available, but this is
probably becasue they are connected to the Lorsch Project.I would not say that this policy of contol will last.  I remain optimistic
that all the libraries in Europe will eventually come around to open data.
 It is a challenging decision to make, given the history of these
institutions.  There is a lot of tradition and institutional intertia to
overcome.  We must continue to exter pressure and demonstrate how valuable
open data can be for scholarship.Jim
