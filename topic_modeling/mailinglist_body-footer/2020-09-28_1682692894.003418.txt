ania Libraries is pleased to announce the 13th Annual (Virtual) Schoenberg Sy=
mposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age:Manuscript Studies in the Digital Covid-19 Age
November 18-20, 2020
In the early spring of 2020, as the world shut down, scholarship and teaching=
 were thrown into a virtual, online world. In the hands-on world of manuscrip=
ts studies, students, teachers, researchers, librarians, and curators lost ph=
ysical access to the very objects upon which their work centered. But we were=
 ready. Thanks to world-wide digitization efforts over the past twenty years,=
 scholars at all levels and around the world have, by all counts, virtual acc=
ess to more manuscripts and manuscript-related metadata than even a generatio=
n ago and are benefited by a broad array of digital tools, technologies, and =
resources that allow them to locate, gather, analyze, and interrogate digitiz=
ed manuscripts and related metadata.But in a Covid-19 Age, have these resources and tools been enough to continue=
 manuscript research and study? Has scholarship and teaching been supported b=
y these resources and tools in the ways that those who created them intended?=
 Has access to these artifacts of our shared intellectual heritage become mor=
e open and equitable or are there still hurdles for scholarship around the wo=
rld to overcome?  Has a forced reckoning with digital tools, technologies, an=
d resources spurred new questions or avenues of research or thrown up barrier=
s? As creators and users of digital tools, technologies, and resources, have =
we learned anything since March about the success or failure of such projects=
? We will consider these questions and the opportunities and limitations offe=
red by digital images and manuscript-related metadata as well as the digital =
and conceptual interfaces that come between the data and us as users. Our goa=
l is to offer a (virtual) space to discuss lessons learned since March and ho=
w those lessons can push us to better practice and development of strategies =
in the future.The symposium will take Wednesday, November 18 to Friday, November 20. Each d=
ay will consist of a 90-minute session with papers in the morning, followed b=
y a 90-minute panel discussion led by invited moderators in the afternoon.  A=
ll sessions will be recorded and made available after each session.Two events will be held conjunction with the symposium:  *   Scholarly Editing Covid`19-Style: Laura Morreale will lead a 3-day crow=
d-sourcing effort to transcribe, edit, and submit for publication an edition =
of Le Pelerinage de Damoiselle Sapience, from UPenn MS Codex 660<https://cole=
nda.library.upenn.edu/catalog/81431-p3cr5nc34> (f. 86r-95v).  *   Virtual Lightning Round: Pre-recorded 5-minute lightning round talks fe=
aturing digital projects at all stages of development, from ideas to implemen=
tation. Want to feature your digital project? Submit your proposal here<https=
://forms.gle/aW4eRSr8fKtU6kPq8> by Friday, October 28, to be considered.For program information and to register, go to: https://www.library.upenn.edu=

public but required. A Zoom link for all three days will be provided upon reg=
