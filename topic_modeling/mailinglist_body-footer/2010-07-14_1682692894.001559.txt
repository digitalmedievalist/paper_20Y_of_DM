Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit  Can anyone report on the status of Oxford's Holinshed Project?  The 
website (http://www.cems.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/) is still up, the parallel 
texts and comparator are functioning, but there's been no news posted 
since September 2009 and the project contact person doesn't reply.  OUP 
was apparently committed to publishing a handbook on the chronicles and 
was considering a 15-volume edition, but the press website is silent on 
Holinshed ("Did you mean to search for: hollingshead?").  Did funding 
disappear altogether?Cheers,
Al Magary
