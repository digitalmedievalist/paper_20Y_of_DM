Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age: Writing the East: History and New
Technologies in the Study of Asian Manuscript Traditions, to be held October
21-22, 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania and the Free Library of
Philadelphia.  This year, our focus is on medieval and early modern Asian
manuscript traditions. Together with Justin McDaniel, University of
Pennsylvania professor of Religious Studies,  Penn Libraries are pleased to
present a distinguished panel of speakers who will explore a range of issues
relating to Asian reading and writing cultures, especially as they pertain
to manuscripts from the Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian
traditions. An addition to the program this year is the Friday afternoon workshop:
Bringing Out the Best from Your Collections:  Ask the Experts!, to be held
Friday, October 21, 2-5 pm, at the Free Library of Philadelphia (Parkway
Central Library, 1901 Vine St, Philadelphia, PA, Room 108).  This workshop
is geared especially toward librarians and curators who oversee collections
of Asian manuscript material but is open to anyone who wishes to learn more
about caring for and interpreting these fascinating and often little
understood objects. For more information on the symposium and workshop and for registration, go
