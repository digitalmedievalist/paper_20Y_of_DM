list of Digital Classicist on (see below).I wonder if you know of sites that catalogue or index original medieval 
texts (Latin, but also Greek and Vernacular). The Corpus Corporum 
(http://www.mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/) sure is the most complete 
(meta-)repository of freely available Latin texts. Other texts are 
indicated in the catalogues of digital editions by Patrick Sahle 
(http://digitale-edition.de/) and Greta Franzini 
(https://dig-ed-cat.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/), both browsable by language and 
period.What would medievalists suggest?Many thanks,
Franz-------- Messaggio Inoltrato --------
Oggetto: 	[DIGITALCLASSICIST] Index or catalogue of original ancient texts?

A: 	DIGITALCLASSICIST(a)JISCMAIL.AC.UKDear colleagues,Do you know of a site that catalogues or indexes original ancient texts 
(Greek, Latin—including Mediaeval Latin etc.—and other classical 
languages are all relevant in this context) wherever on the web they may 
be? Sites such as Perseus, Latin Library, Intratext, Poesia Latin, 
Loebolus, Wikisource, Google Books, all have different coverage (and 
quality) of ancient texts. The DLL Catalog 
(https://catalog.digitallatin.org/) aim to catalogue Latin texts of this 
kind, but don't seem to capture things like Wikisource, Gutenberg or Google.Where would you go to find all possible free and open sources of Latin 
text of, for example, Geoffrey of Monmouth? Or Greek equivalent?Many thanks in advance for any suggestions, and all best,Gabby==
