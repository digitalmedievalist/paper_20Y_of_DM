A snippet of Lydgate, at http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/lydgate/ (a pilot XML 
project at the University of Victoria)
The EETS pilot project (part of the Ancrene Wisse), at 
http://www.tei-c.org/Projects/EETS/
The Charrette Project, at http://www.princeton.edu/~lancelot/ 
<http://www.princeton.edu/%7Elancelot/> (if your students want something 
in French)All provide MS images and transcriptions. The EETS Ancrene Wisse also 
provides a translation. Translations of some material from the 
Auchinleck MS are readily available in print.There is a good on-line paleography course at 
http://www.medieval.unimelb.edu.au/ductus/You may also wish to investigate some CD editions, e.g. Murray 
McGillivray's _Hypertext Book of the Duchess_ (University of Calgary 
Press) or Gerrit Bunt's _William of Palerne_ (SEENET).Hope some of that is helpful. I would be interested to know of other 
similar sites.Yin--
