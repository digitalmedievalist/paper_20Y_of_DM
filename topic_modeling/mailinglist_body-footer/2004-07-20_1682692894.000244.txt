be no further development. I've heard that it doesn't do Unicode; are 
thorn and eth still problems? Mac users are migrating to Safari, and it 
won't be long before IE will be quite rare on Macs. Next time you 
upgrade your system, you may decide that it's just not worth it to have 
IE hanging around just so you can run your Junius 11 CD. Let's hope 
there's a standards-compliant upgrade before that time.PeterMartin K. Foys wrote:> Digital Medievalist Journal (Inaugural Issue Fall 2004). Call for
