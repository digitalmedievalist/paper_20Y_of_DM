we've just released EVT 0.1.62 with experimental support for the=20
embedded transcription method. A sample edition collecting miscellaneous=20
examples (including those presented in the Guidelines) is available here:http://vbd.humnet.unipi.it/evt-et/and a blog post describing EVT changes is here:http://visualizationtechnology.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/tei-embedded-transcri=
ption-support-in-evt/while the EVT code with all of above is as usual available on Sourceforge:https://sourceforge.net/projects/evt-project/We'd appreciate feedback and suggestions on how to improve it (and of=20
course other EVT features), as written in the blog post we weren't sure=20
of how to interpret some of the possible use cases. Seeing TEI XML from=20
the point of view of a tool developer, for once, was an eye opening=20
experience!Last, but definitely not least, let me thank the EADH "small grants"=20
program which made this expansion of EVT's features possible.Best,R--=20Roberto Rosselli Del Turco      roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
