the release notes:This release continues to add characters from the MUFI recommendation
to benefit medievalists. Many messy outlines have been cleaned up,
improving efficiency and reducing the likelihood of bugs. Most of the
goodies in this release are for users of OpenType-aware programs such
as InDesign and XeTeX: the OpenType features list has been thoroughly
worked over and rationalized, and consistency imposed across all four
faces (though it is still true that there are more OpenType features
in Regular than in the other three). Use of ccmp, mark and mkmk has
been greatly expanded, making use of combining diacritics more
practical than before. Many MUFI glyphs have been made accessible via
OpenType features, especially ccmp (for glyph+diacritic combination)
and hlig (Historical Ligatures). Fractions, Roman numbers, subscripts
and the various "Enclosed Alphanumerics" have been made accessible as
ligatures (either liga, Standard Ligatures, or dlig, Discretionary
Ligatures).Peter Baker--===============4049142779807585273==--
