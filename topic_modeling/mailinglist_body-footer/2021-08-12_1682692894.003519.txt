Dear list members,
I would like to call your attention to the following job opening in the ERC C=
onsolidator Grant-funded Dissident Networks Project (DISSINET, https://dissin=
et.cz), where we use various computational methods to shed new light on medie=
val religious dissidence and inquisition. We are now searching to extend the =
team by hiring a computational linguist, programming Latinist, or NLP special=
ist to join the adventure. The role will be to lead the constitution of a cor=
pus of OCR-ed editions of inquisition records and, in collaboration with the =
larger team, study features related to the language of those records such as =
their vocabulary, the style of recording, the construction of deposition narr=
atives, the use of language for social control, etc.
In contrast to a call I circulated earlier, we are not only open to postdocs =
but also to those who have not yet completed their PhD studies, and even thos=
e who would like to do their PhD in the Study of Religions with us at Masaryk=
 University on the topic of this research strand within DISSINET.
The deadline for the submission of applications is 15 September 2021.
For more information, please see below.
I would be very grateful if you could forward this message to candidates pote=
ntially interested in this position.
All the best,David Zb=C3=ADral
Number of open positions: 1Expected start: 1 November 2021 (negotiable)Duration: 31 October 2022 (first contract), 31 August 2026 (very probable ext=

The Dissident Networks Project (DISSINET, https://dissinet.cz/) - an ERC Cons=
olidator Grant-funded research initiative based at Masaryk University (Brno, =
Czech Republic) - offers a full-time research fellowship in computational tex=
t analysis. The research of the successful applicant will focus on the discur=
sive patterns in medieval inquisitorial records, with the aim of shining a ne=
w light on the production of these texts, their discourses, and the religious=
 cultures they describe.
We are searching for a research fellow with one of the following types of pro=
file:(a) programming Latinist, or digital humanist, with competence in one or more=
 historical languages and some experience in programming; or(b) computational linguist, NLP specialist or text mining specialist, with in=
terest in history or historical languages;(c) another kind of mixed/interdisciplinary profile, with some of the previou=
sly mentioned competencies and strong interest in working on a historical res=
earch project.
The successful candidate will develop their own research direction in consult=
ation with the Principal Investigator (Dr. David Zb=C3=ADral), focusing on th=
e computational text processing and analysis of medieval inquisition records.
DISSINET also works extensively on the manual coding of medieval inquisitoria=
l material, offering a significant close-reading layer of data. We focus on v=
arious computational approaches to Christian dissent and inquisition, also in=
cluding social network analysis, socio-semantic network analysis, and geograp=
hic information science: the successful candidate will have the opportunity t=
o produce mixed-methodology work in this collaborative context. The ERC-funde=
d position thus represents a unique opportunity for building a truly cutting-=
edge research profile.
The position is residential (although with reasonable flexibility for pandemi=
c-related travel restrictions). Brno is a very pleasant university city in th=
e Czech Republic, European Union, ca. 2 hours by direct train connection from=
 Vienna and Prague, and offers all the opportunities of a modern metropolis.

nformation.
