SESSION DESCRIPTIONS
----------------------------------------"Digital Methods: Anglo-Saxon Manuscript Studies"The aim of the papers in this session is to consider what twenty-first
century technology might offer us in the study of the handwriting of
the scribes who were producing charters, homilies, farming memoranda
and other aspects of the written culture of Anglo-Saxon England. Utilising
computer-based resources for the study of medieval handwriting, the papers
will investigate the development of letter forms; the influence of scriptoria
and the politics of writing style; the significance of scribal choices such
as vernacular script in preference to, or alongside, Caroline letter forms; a=
nd
whether text type can be said to determine the style of writing.
"Digital Methods: Reading between the Lines of Medieval Manuscripts"Glosses and marginalia in Old English manuscripts have been understudied, with
nineteenth century editions often being relied upon in the absence of more
recent work. In this session, the papers will ask whether the development
of methodologies based in digital technologies affords us the opportunity to
produce new work and new discoveries in this area. Areas explored will include
the study and detection of scratched glosses; the handwriting of the Old
English glosses to the Lindisfarne and Rushworth Gospels; the relationship
between so-called main text and writings in the margins; the hierarchy
of scripts for glossing and annotation; and producing new edited texts.
