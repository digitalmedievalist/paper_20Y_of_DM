21st Jan: Info-viz and political activism. Paolo Gerbaudo (King's College Lon=
don)
Abstract: Info-visualisation is a practice that has been widely utilised in c=
ontemporary digital culture, in order to get to grips with the complex patter=
ns emerging from huge sets of data. Among the different categories utilising =
info-viz, including programmers, marketers, financial analysts, security pers=
onnel, and government advisors, also activists have found in info-viz a power=
ful visual language to get to grips with the complexity of social grievances =
and economic problems in a highly complex and globalised world. In my present=
ation I will look at the political positioning of info-visualisation as a rad=
ical political language in collectives such as Bureau d-Etudes and RTMark, as=
 well as drawing on my own work infondoalmar.info. I will discuss the extent =
to which info-viz can constitute a platform for radical politics, and look at=
 some possible lines of future development of these practices.
