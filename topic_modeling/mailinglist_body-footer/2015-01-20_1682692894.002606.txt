the ancient world that employs innovative digital and interdisciplinary 
methods. The seminars are held on Friday afternoons from June to 
mid-August in the Institute of Classical Studies, Senate House, London, 
WC1E 7HU.We are seeking contributions from students as well as established 
researchers and practitioners. We welcome papers discussing individual 
projects and their immediate contexts, but also wish to accommodate the 
broader theoretical considerations of the use of digital methods in the 
study of the ancient world, including ancient cultures beyond the 
classical Mediterranean. You should expect a mixed audience of 
classicists, philologists, historians, archaeologists, information 
scientists and digital humanists, and take particular care to cater for 
the presence of graduate students in the audience.There is a budget to assist with travel to London (usually from within 
the UK, but we have occasionally been able to assist international 
presenters to attend).To submit a proposal for consideration, email an abstract of no more 
than 500 words to s.mahony(a)ucl.ac.uk <mailto:s.mahony(a)ucl.ac.uk> by 
midnight GMT on March 8th, 2015.Further information and details of past seminars, including several 
peer-reviewed publications, are available at:
