University of Lancaster, UK

international calendar as a major forum bringing together scholars,
postgraduate students, librarians, archivists, curators, information
scientists and computing professionals in a unique and positive way,
to share ideas and information about the creation, exploitation, use,
management and preservation of digital resources in the arts and
humanities.At this, the tenth DRH conference, we plan to encourage papers and
sessions that focus on critical evaluation of the use of digital
resources in the arts and humanities.  What has the impact really
been?  What kinds of methodologies are being used?  What are the
assumptions that underlie our work?  How do we know that the work
that we accomplish is truly new and innovative? How does technology
change the way that we work?The Conference will also address some of the key emerging themes and
strategic issues that engagement with ICT is bringing to scholarly
research in the arts and humanities, with a particular focus on
advanced research methods.  The kinds of questions that we would like
to see addressed might include the following: what sort of research
does ICT in the arts and humanities enable researchers to do that
could not be done before at all? Does this enable 'old' research to
be done in a significantly new way? In what ways does the technology
serve the scholarship?  Similarly, what are the key aspects of
virtual research environments ("cyberinfrasture") which can
facilitate collaborative research?Proposals for individual papers, sessions, workshops and posters are
invited, and the abstract submission system at the conference website
will be accepting proposals from January 31st, 2005.
Types of presentation for which proposals are invited:PapersProposals for papers should be no less than 750 words. Papers will be
allocated 30 minutes for presentation, including questions.SessionsSessions (90 minutes) take the form of either:Three papers. The session organizer should submit a 500-word
statement describing the proposed session topic, and include
abstracts of no less than 750 words for each paper. The session
organizer must also indicate that each author is willing to
participate in the session;orA panel of four to six speakers. The panel organizer should submit an
abstract of 750-1500 words describing the panel topic, how it will be
organized, the names of all the speakers, and an indication that each
speaker is willing to participate in the session.Poster PresentationsPoster presentations may include computer technology and project
demonstrations. Posters presentations may be a more suitable way of
presenting late-breaking results, or significant work in progress.
There should be no difference in quality between poster presentations
and papers, and both will be submitted to the same refereeing process.As an acknowledgement of the special contribution of the posters to
the conference, the Programme Committee will once again award a prize
for the best poster presentation.
The Local Organising Committee is headed by Tony McEnery and Andrew
Hardie, Department of Linguistics and English Language, University of
Lancaster.Please contact the local organizers with any questions about
registration or conference arrangements at Lancaster:
