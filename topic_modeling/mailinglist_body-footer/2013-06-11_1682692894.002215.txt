difficulties in finding people with corresponding experiences and 
willingness to share their thoughts:When planning to set up a platform on which an international and 
interdisciplinary community of humanities researchers (most probably not 
all versed in digital technologies) is invited to exchange their ideas, 
questions, announcements around a certain thematic focus consisting in a 
"historically localizable" discourse (in this case the so-called "School 
of Salamanca" of the 16th and 17th centuries), what type of platform 
would you prefer, and why? Blog, Mailing list, Bulletin Board, Wiki, 
...?
How do you perceive access and participation thresholds, 
popularity/dissemination/visibility, feedback likelihood, etc?To possibly provoke some comments, here are a few intuitions of mine. 
Please contradict and challenge (or confirm) based on your experiences, 
or your intuitions:- Blogs are easily accessible and can be viewed/read comfortable, but 
   they tend to have a restriced set of authors. Can anyone imagine 
   applying for authorship rights to a blog administration in order to 
   just pose one question or to advertise one conference?- The same holds for wiki sites.- Social networks like academia.edu, itergateway groups etc. depend on 
   people to focus on one such network which might not be their favorite 
   one, so a too large portion of interested persons is kept out.- Bulletin Boards are a mess.- Twitter messages are too short.- Mailing lists are not subscribed to because they look old-fashioned. 
   Being somewhat nerdy myself, they are my personal favorites, however.On the other hand, when I have asked that same question on my facebook 
profile, the only response I did get was a suggestion to go for a blog. 
In other social networks or fora (academia.edu, 
community.itergateway.org, researchgate.net etc.) I did not get any 
reply at all (although some are watching/following the question).I would be very grateful for any insights shared...Best regards,Andreas
