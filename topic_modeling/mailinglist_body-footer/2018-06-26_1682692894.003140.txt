ital Age
November 15-17, 2018Illuminations: Manuscript, Medium, MessageIn partnership with the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of Philadelp=
hia, the Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies at the University of Penn=
sylvania Libraries is pleased to announce the 11th Annual Lawrence J. Schoenb=
erg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age.Manuscript illumination has often been considered in relation to the texts it=
 accompanies, but rarely in terms of its interplay with other artistic media.=
 Historically, however, the technique was closely associated with other forms=
 of artistic expression and served as a crucial point of contact and transfer=
 for visual motifs across space and time. The goal of this year's symposium i=
s to examine cases of intermedial exchange through the lenses of technique, s=
tyle, iconography, social context, and cultural geography, while also posing =
broader questions about the deep connections between the craft of illuminatio=
n and other arts more widely. Of special interest will be insights gained fro=
m the technical examination of works in different media, new comparisons made=
 possible by digital technology, and the discovery of linkages once obscured =
by strict historiographical divisionsFor more information, go to https://www.library.upenn.edu/about/events/kislak=
