CAPAL16: BEYOND THE LIBRARY: AGENCY, PRACTICE, AND SOCIETYCAPAL/ACBAP Annual Conference =E2=80=93 May 28=E2=80=93June 3, 2016
Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences 2016
University of Calgary
Calgary, AlbertaThe Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians (CAPAL) invites =
participation in its annual conference, to be held as part of Congress of the=
 Humanities and Social Sciences 2016 at the University of Calgary, Calgary, A=
lberta, Canada (http://congress2016.ca/). The conference offers opportunity t=
o share critical research and scholarship, challenge current thinking, and fo=
rge new relationships across all disciplines.THEMEIn keeping with the Congress 2016 theme, Energizing Communities, CAPAL16 seek=
s to look =E2=80=9CBeyond the Library=E2=80=9D to rethink how academic librar=
ians engage with their communities within which our institutions are situated=
 or those with whom we share disciplinary concerns or approaches. Such commun=
ities may be physical, epistemic, academic, or imagined communities, communit=
ies of identity, or those communities around us and to which we contribute.What can the discipline of library and information studies (LIS) learn from o=
ther disciplines?  What might LIS as an interdisciplinary field look like?  W=
here and how should academic librarianship be situated within and in relation=
 to other communities?RATIONALELike any institution, academic libraries both reflect and help shape the soci=
eties of which they are part. It is therefore critical for academic librarian=
s to consider how they and their work are situated =E2=80=93 professionally, =
ontologically, ethically, epistemologically, and physically. As social agents=
, we share and occupy socio-economic, political, and technological spaces in =
our efforts to provide diverse, high quality, informational resources and cri=
tical education within a contemporary (i.e., neoliberal) legal and economic f=
ramework.In such an environment, effecting change requires seeking out, examining, and=
 engaging with new ideas, approaches, theories, communities, understandings, =
and ways of knowing, which, themselves, may fall outside the traditional boun=
daries of the discipline of library and information studies. We need to move =
our lines of inquiry =E2=80=9Cbeyond the library=E2=80=9D=E2=80=93physically =
and intellectually=E2=80=93into new arenas and new communities. This conferen=
ce is an invitation to academic librarians and scholars who study libraries a=
nd information to discuss how we can reframe academic librarianship: in pract=
ice, in policy, in theory, and in society.Potential topic areas include but are not limited to:SUBMISSION INFORMATIONThe Program Committee invites proposals for individual papers as well as prop=
osals for panel submissions of three papers. Individual papers are typically =
20 minutes in length. For individual papers, please submit an abstract of 300=
 words and a presentation title, with brief biographical statement and your c=
ontact information. For complete panels, please submit a panel abstract of 30=
0 words as well as a list of all participants and brief biographical statemen=
ts, and a separate abstract of 300 words for each presenter. Please identify =
and provide participants' contact information for the panel organizer=
. International proposals and proposals from non-members and students are wel=
come.Please feel free to contact the Program Committee to discuss a topic for a pa=
