on transcriptions of some very formulaic accounting documents. It was
enough work to get them through the medieval paleography and language
that I didn't want them spending a lot of time mastering XML or new
programs. So, I created a simplified schema that they could easily
memorize and let them insert tags in their generic word processor.The tags (e.g. <id>...</id> for a proper name of a person;
<amt>...</amt> for amount, etc.) are easily converted into TEI
compliant XML with a simple search and replace macro. I wanted two
sets of eyes on the transcriptions, so I had each text transcribed by
two different students, but only one copy included tags.  I created a
couple of tag validators so they could easily check their markup.
Then, I designed an editorial review utility that allows me to
highlight differences between the dual transcriptions, and incorporate
any of my modifications (to transcriptions or tags) into the final
transcription.The grad students who were in charge of supervising teams of
undergrads worked pretty hard at removing ambiguity in our editorial
conventions through lots of communication. I've still got plenty of
master editing to do, but we cranked through an awful lot of pages
this way, and the students loved the experience.Jesse
