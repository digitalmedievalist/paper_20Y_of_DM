Humanities Series. The series is overseen by an international board of 
experts and its books subjected to rigorous peer review. Its objective 
is to encourage and support the development of experimental monographs, 
edited volumes and collections that extend the boundaries of the field 
and help to strengthen its interrelations with the other disciplines of 
the arts, humanities and beyond. We are also interested in introductory 
guides for non-specialists, best practices guides for practitioners and 
"state of the art" surveys. The Series will offer digital humanists a 
dedicated venue for high-quality, Open Access publication.Proposals in any area of the Digital Humanities are invited. For further 
details and instructions on how to submit please see
