**/Cultural Heritage Markup:
Using Markup to preserve, understand, and disseminate cultural heritage mater=
ials
a Balisage pre-conference symposiumMonday August 10, 2015
Bethesda North Marriott Hotel & Conference Center, Bethesda, MD, USAMarkup and markup technologies are used in a wide variety of cultural heritag=
e projects by linguists, students of literature, librarians, historians, cura=
tors, and others. Markup is used behind the scenes in archives, libraries, an=
d museums to create and store metadata and the textual content of a wide vari=
ety of materials both textual and artefactual. We want to know how you or you=
r project are using markup to preserve, analyze, disseminate, or curate mater=
ials of long-term value to society.Balisage is an excellent venue to discuss both theoretical and practical ques=
tions. Is cultural heritage markup essentially different from industrial mark=
up? Is it inherently more heterogeneous, more complex? Are =E2=80=9Cindustria=
l=E2=80=9D tools like XML and HTML really appropriate for cultural heritage m=
aterials? How well will standards like TEI and EAD serve us as technology pro=
gresses? We dedicate this day to discussion of the challenges and possibiliti=
es of markup technologies used in the preservation of our cultural heritage a=
nd its transmission to future generations.We welcome proposals to present at the Symposium. Topics may include, but are=
 not limited to:=E2=80=A2 Representing heterogeneous materials
=E2=80=A2 Data modeling to support scholarly research
=E2=80=A2 Building for the long term, even after the money has run out
=E2=80=A2 Using/repurposing tools that weren't designed for the kind =
of thing you're doing
=E2=80=A2 What are the benefits and challenges of using XML for representing =
texts of scholarly interest? What about non-textual artifacts?
=E2=80=A2 What does it mean for cultural heritage texts to be interoperable?
=E2=80=A2 Shared tag sets. Are shared markup vocabularies (e.g., TEI, EAD, LI=
DO, CDWA) sufficient? How can we improve them?Full papers should be submitted by 17 April 2015. All papers are peer-reviewe=
d =E2=80=94 we pride ourselves that you will seldom get a more thorough, skep=
tical, or helpful review than the one provided by Balisage reviewers.Key dates:
