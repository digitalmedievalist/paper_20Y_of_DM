         15th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng 2015),                         September 8-11, 2015,
       at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland                       http://www.doceng2015.org-----------------------------------------------------------------------The 15th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng 2015) seeks 
original research papers that focus on the design, implementation, 
development, management, use and evaluation of advanced systems where 
documents and document collections play a key role.DocEng is a leading international forum for researchers, practitioners, 
developers and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and to exchange 
techniques, tools and experiences.DocEng emphasizes innovative approaches to document engineering 
technology, use of documents and document collections in real world 
applications, novel principles, tools and processes that improve our 
ability to create, manage, maintain, share, and productively use these.You are invited to submit original papers to the 15th ACM Symposium on 
Document Engineering (DocEng 2015), to be held at the Ecole 
Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. Attendees at this 
international forum have interests that span all aspects of document 
engineering and applications.DocEng is sponsored by ACM by means of the ACM SIGWEB Special Interest 
Group. Proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library.Symposium Chair: Christine Vanoirbeek (EPFL, Switzerland)
Program Chair:   Pierre Genevès (CNRS, France)
Submissions
===========Authors are invited to submit original work in one of the following forms:* Full papers describing complete works of research (up to 10 pages)
* Short papers describing smaller complete works of research or novel
   challenges or visions (up to 4 pages)
* Application notes describing systems or tools of interest (up to 4 pages)
* Workshop/tutorial proposals: tutorials are by a domain expert and
   introduce a current topic of interest to symposium attendees while 
workshops provide an informal setting in which to develop vision and 
exchange ideas in a specialized field of interest.Accepted papers will be included in the DocEng proceedings and published 
in the ACM Digital Library.Students presenting their work at DocEng 2015 will be eligible to apply 
for SIGWEB Student Travel Awards.
