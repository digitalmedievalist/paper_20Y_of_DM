BEOWULF THE ETHEREAL EVENT BRINGS BEOWULF TO ZOOMOn November 14 and 15, Beowulf the Ethereal Event will present all of the poe=
m Beowulf, performed live on Zoom.  The entire epic will be split into two pe=
rformances, live-streamed to the SCA East Kingdom's YouTube channel: =
https://www.youtube.com/c/SCAEastKingdomEthereal=E2=80=A2         Part 1: Saturday, November 14, starting at 7:30 pm Eastern =
time.=E2=80=A2         Part 2: Sunday, November 15, at 2:00 pm Eastern time.The performances will be posted to YouTube permanently at a later date.Beowulf the Ethereal Event will feature the talents of 50 performers from all=
 over the United States and Canada.The performance is being produced by the artistic team who staged live story-=
telling performances of Beowulf in 2011 and 2012 and of Njal's Saga i=
n 2017.The poem tells the story of the hero Beowulf, who rescues the Danes by killin=
g the monstrous Grendel. He goes on to kill Grendel's mother, become =
king, and then=E2=80=94in his old age=E2=80=94must face a dragon. Throughout,=
 he learns lessons about kingship, feud, and the dangers inherent in fighting=
 monsters.The performance will be presented with the natural, organic backgrounds of ou=
r homes=E2=80=94bookshelves, workshops, home offices, kitchens, and living ro=
oms. We will tell the story without stage magic, but instead will use the ava=
ilable medium to bring Beowulf into the homes of the audience.The performance text includes translations by Howell Chickering, R.M. Liuzza,=
 Craig Williamson, A.S. Kline, Francis Grummere, M. Wendy Hennequin, Michael =
Dixon, and Emily Holbert. We are grateful for the permission to use their wor=
ks. The artistic team gratefully acknowledges the support of the East Kingdom=
 Web Ministry, and the East Kingdom Ministry of Arts and Sciences.From Director Michael Dixon:=E2=80=9CBeowulf is still relevant today. Leadership matters, well-earned loy=
alty is essential, and pride is a dangerous path," Toki said, adding that Nie=
tzche's advice was true for Beowulf, and is true today, "Beware that, when fi=
ghting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster."For more information, see the performance web site: https://sites.google.com/=
