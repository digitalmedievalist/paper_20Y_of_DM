converting SGML to XML using osx on my Powerbook for months. I installed it 
from the opensp3 package using fink (google fink for details). Wouldn't work 
on OS9, of course...I'm not really familiar with everything that goes on in the background with 
SGML catalogs and so forth, but it certainly can work on a mac.David Mimno
