teiPublisher site more thoroughly. Now as to Al Magary's specific 
question, since I'm in the odd position of actually liking XSLT (as 
opposed to merely tolerating it), why yes, if you marked up your Latin 
quotations with <lq> tags, just a few lines of XSLT would pull those out 
and display them in (say) a web page. Just a slightly more complex 
script would display the Latin quotations in Ch. 5, or allow for more 
flexible types of searches. This kind of script works extemely well as a 
back end for a web site.PeterMartin Holmes wrote:> Hi there,
