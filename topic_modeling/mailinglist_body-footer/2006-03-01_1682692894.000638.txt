Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitApologies if this sounds a bit like carping about what is indeed a great 
step forward in enhancing access to these resources, but I'm rather 
disappointed to see that UM still appears to think that HTML is the only 
way of delivering them.According to the front page "All texts in the archive are valid SGML 
documents, tagged in conformance with the TEI Guidelines, and converted 
to the TEI Lite DTD for wider use."However I'm blessed if I can see any way in which the texts can be 
obtained from the site *in* that SGML format. Which rather devalues that 
nice promise about "wider use" doesn't it?Some of us would like to be able to do other kinds of research, beyond 
what the web interface offers. I'd like to do corpus linguistics kinds 
of things. I want to crunch these texts up and look for linguistic 
patterns in them. I don't want to depend on the web for access and I 
don't want to be restricted to what UM has decided is the way these 
texts should be presented.Why do I have to resort to "screen scraping"? Do I really have to 
download each file individually and convert the HTML back into something 
more expressive? Actually that's not too hard -- as a quick "view 
source" shows -- but what a waste of time! That's not what I signed up 
for when I joined the digital revolution!still crazyLouAl Magary wrote:> [Announcement by Paul Schaffner forwarded from another medieval list.
