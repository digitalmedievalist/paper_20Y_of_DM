Scott CatledgeEven a mere list of lemmata is the result of a serious decision making
process, consisting a.o. of defining selection criteria, defining the
spelling of an entry (in historical dictionaries), etc. And it is usually
based on a corpus of texts, sometimes compiled by the lexicographers
themselves.It has been tested in court. Someone had published a cd with a rhyming
dictionary and had used the list of lemmata of the Van Dale dictionary of
Dutch. Van Dale won the law suit. It was about 10, maybe 15 years ago.Katrien
