on that catalogue (... of course you should also go make sure to add them
to that publicly contributed catalogue!).   I'm planning an assignment
where students might compare/contrast various medieval critical digital
editions and the suggestions that those made to me privately are great
additions.  (If people have any more, I'm all ears...  I might even go add
them to the catalogue myself.)Thanks!JamesOn Tue, 16 Oct 2018 at 18:24, James Cummings <james(a)blushingbunny.net>
