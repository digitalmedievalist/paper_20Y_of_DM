We are delighted to announce a new seminar and workshop series to take
place from November 2014 to May 2015 at the University of Leeds: Medieval
Studies in the Digital Age
<http://medievalstudiesinthedigitalage.wordpress.com/>.Designed as a forum for medievalists from various disciplines who are
interested in the digital humanities, our aim is to critically discuss the
role of digital technologies in the field of medieval studies as well as
providing insights into current practices and ways of using digital tools
in scholarship through a series of seminars and workshops.We will be launching the Medieval Studies in the Digital Age Seminar and
Workshop Series <http://medievalstudiesinthedigitalage.wordpress.com/> at
Leeds with *Professor Ralph W. Mathisen*'s seminar entitled *=E2=80=
=98 =E2=80=9CGarbage In
Garbage Out=E2=80=9D: The Unfulfilled Promise of Prosopographical Databases=
'* on 18
November 2014, Tuesday.Professor Mathisen is Professor of History, Classics, and Medieval Studies
at the Department of History at the University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign, USA, and he will be talking about how prosopographical
databases can be created and thus help us to understand how people
interacted with each other in the past. He will then speculate about why
the great promise of prosopographical databases never has come to fruition.
