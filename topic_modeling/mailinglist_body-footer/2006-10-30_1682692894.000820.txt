'counting and computing numbers'. If so, stick to Excel. Access is a
database. Databases are about describing/modeling, categorising, searching
and selecting data. Spreadsheets are the things of use if you actually want
to count things and apply statistics.That said, you could do it in Access - but it would take a considerable
amount of additional VBA-scripting to get Access to count your phenomena
properly. Excel should provide standard functions and solutions in most
cases.If you're talking about really vast amounts of data, consider using more
advanced statistical tools like SPSS or Stata.Hope this helps,
y.s.,
Joris van Zundert
