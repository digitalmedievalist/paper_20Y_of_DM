Dear list,the Centre for Information Modelling - Austrian Centre for Digital
Humanities at the University of Graz is inviting to a two days sympoisum
on DIGITAL SCHOLARLY EDTIONS AS INTERFACES which is kindly endorsed by
DiXiT. The symposium will discuss the relationship between digital
scholarly editing and interfaces by bringing together experts of DSEs
and Interface Design, editors and users of editions, web designers and
developers. It will include the discussion of (graphical/user)
interfaces of DSEs as much as conceptualizing the digital edition itself
as an interface. Keynote Speakers are Dot Porter (University of
Pennsylvania) and Stan Ruecker (IIT Institute of Design).
Please find attached the details about dates and venue, the link to the
registration form and the official programme.
