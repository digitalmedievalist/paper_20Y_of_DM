I have a pleasure to invite you join Medieval Colloquium - in this new
project we want to socialize with Medieval great people. Please find all
details and an invitation for an online meeting below. Apologies for any

With best regards,

Being a Medievalist is so much fun mostly because of the colourful and
fascinating personalities you encounter. It=C2=B4s all about people. Medievals
are sophisticated and primitive, their discussions and wars are full of
zeal, their problems are fresh and their answers - surprising.Let=C2=B4s begin this new season at Collegium Volatile by meeting some really
interesting Old Masters.Medieval Colloquium is an online event and anyone can join.  Each week we
watch a short video lecture given by an expert Medievalist who talks about
his or her favourite Medieval personality (a thinker, an artist or a
historical protagonist). We also read a short text assigned for that week:
a source text related to the person we discuss. The same week we have a
live online meeting (using video, voice and typing) to ask questions and
share our ideas on the subject. Participants are also invited to share
notes and links with each other. All the activities are available only to
registered Colloquium participants (they are not publically visible on the
web).We also plan to publish ebook proceedings with all the lectures beautifully
edited and illustrated.If you would like to join the lecturers team - come to the online meeting
25 Sept 2013 at 22.00 CEST time (please find your time here:
