Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitWhen I think of publishers and series of digital medieval studies, the
first two that spring to mind are SEENET (Society of Early English and
Norse Electronic Texts) and SDE (Scholarly Digital Editions). Are there
others? I'm particularly interested in finding series or publishers with
several digital studies published, and, even better, any that have
developed a house style adopted by more than one project (i.e. not just
several volumes issued by the same project, but also several projects in
the same press/series).Appreciate any help!-dan
