weeks ago. pegging your applications and content to proprietary 
technology leaves you exposed when that technology turns out to be so 
problematic that people are starting to abandon it, as is the case now 
with IE and its security issues.on the other hand, if you're building according to standards, when one 
browser turns out to be so problematic that people abandon it, they can 
still use your app on their new standards-compliant browser. and you 
don't force people who use a different OS to use two or more different 
computers. of course, if you have a captive audience, you can force 
people to do a lot of things.interestingly, it looks like it's just possible that Apple is 
cooperating with Mozilla and Opera in developing a standards-compliant 
version of something like ActiveX. The following, posted this morning 
to an information architects mailing list, may be of interest to this 
group:http://homepage.mac.com/jhobbs/essays/in any case, the idea is a good one, imo.jjeffrey fisher
