Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit	Sorry, this is dumb and somewhat TANgential.  I've been browsing
Peter Lang's site (http://www.peterlang.com) and find that higher-order
characters are not rendering in Firefox 0.9.1.  The page info says it's
UTF-8, but when I set Firefox to that (Tools | Options | Languages |
Default character encoding) nothing happens.
	I've added German and French to the languages, but that changes 
nothing.  My system is running WinXPpro.  Advice?  Thanks!--
