Finding a Friendlier Front End: User Interface Design for Electronic 
Critical EditionsAbstract submission deadline: Sept. 15, 2005This session hopes to feature both real practices and imagined ideals 
for crafting a better presentation of data in electronic critical 
editions. While some presentations may deal in part with tools or 
initiatives for developers, the focus is really on the user. Are 
there factors of layout and design that make it easier for the user 
to access complex data? What tools can we provide that facilitate the 
user's experience with an ancient text? In what ways can we yet 
exploit the new media to enhance the interaction of the reader with a 
textual tradition? What are some best practices in designing an 
interface that adequately reflects the 'mouvance' of a text? What is 
the potential functionality of an electronic critical apparatus? 
Topics need not be limited to existing technologies.Send abstracts (include websites if appropriate) to Jesse D. Hurlbut at:jesse_hurlbut(a)byu.edu
