in London July 7-10), I hope some of you will be there as well. If you're
curious, here is the website: http://dh2010.cch.kcl.ac.uk/We'd like to give DM folks an opportunity to meet informally during the
conference, so I'm working with Peter Stokes (who won't be able to attend
the conference, but who lives in London) to organize a lunch on one of the
days of the conference. It looks like Wednesday will be the best day to
meet; although it's technically registration day (no sessions until the
evening keynote and reception following), the other days have association
AGMs during lunch, and we want to encourage people to attend those if they
can.So...
If you are going to be at DH2010, and/or if you live in London,
and if you would like to meet informally with other DMers,
and if you will be available at lunchtime on Wednesday July 7 (or, if you
would like to petition that we aim for another day),please send me a message at dot.porter(a)gmail.com to let me know. Peter is
looking at local venues, but it would help if we could have a rough estimate
of how many people we might expect.Thanks! Hope to see some of you in London soon.Dot--
