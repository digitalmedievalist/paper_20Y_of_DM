I just wanted to remind you about the open CfA (see the call below).The deadline is on the 15th!
Digital methods are by definition at the border of Medieval Studies. This bol=
d statement is primarily justified by the observation that the application of=
 digital methods is triggered by a research community outside Medieval Studie=
s, i.e. Computer Science and New Media Studies. Therefore, in its interdiscip=
linary nature digital medieval studies is a border-crossing discipline and br=
eaks up traditionally developed scholarly silos and institutional borders. Wi=
thin this field, experimentations with and applications of new methods and te=
chnologies challenge traditional perceptions and research approaches. Another=
 kind of digital borders are "metadata borders". For example, digital catalog=
ing standards create unintended, and sometimes intended, borders and boundari=
es that prevent data-sharing and linking.
In light of this proposition, the Digital Medievalist will take the opportuni=
ty of next years' general IMC theme ("Borders") to discuss cutting edge and "=
border-crossing" digital methods and technologies and/or borders and boundari=
es caused by digital methods. Topics may include current research in machine =
learning, computer vision, 3D modeling, IIIF, multispectral imaging, Handwrit=
ten Text Recognition, Linked Data and distant reading, etc. Machine learning,=
 for instance, poses specific problems for Medieval Studies, as its success d=
epends on the availability, findability, reusability, and accessibility of la=
rge amounts of data. Similar issues exist with the application of other digit=
al methods to medieval materials, and the session(s) "Digital Borders of Medi=
eval Studies" will be the place to present and discuss them.
The Digital Medievalist community invites the submission of proposals for 20-=
minutes papers covering a topic relating to the session title and focusing on=
 the application of digital methods and technologies for current and future r=
esearch in the field of Medieval Studies.Please send your proposal (300 Words incl. a short CV) to dm.imc2020(a)gmail.=
com by Sept. 15th.--===============3016978738880595227==
