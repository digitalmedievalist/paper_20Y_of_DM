be able to sort according to individual words and then map those usages
against other terms to map out their relationships. I'd also like to be able
to tag the terms in a number of ways, especially according to date of
appearance. I know I've run across references to software that allows this
kind of thing (other than just fancy SQL programming), but I can't call any
of it to mind. Anyone know of any easily accessible and not too expensive software that
does this kind of thing? Or is my memory completely faulty? Thx, and best from Anchorage, Dan ____________________________________Daniel T.
