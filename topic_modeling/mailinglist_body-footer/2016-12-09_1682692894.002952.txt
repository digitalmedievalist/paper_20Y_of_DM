symposium series on Global DH into its second year. Digital humanities
scholarship continues to be driven by work at the intersections of of a
range of distinct disciplines and an ethical commitment to preserve and
broaden access to cultural materials. The most engaged global DH
scholarship, that which MSU champions
<http://cplong.org/2016/10/critical-diversity-in-a-digital-age/>, values
digital tools that enhance the capacity of scholarly critique to reflect a
broad range of literary, historical, new media, and cultural positions, and
diverse ways of valuing cultural production and knowledge work.
Particularly valuable are strategies in which the digital form expresses a
critique of the digital content and the position of the researcher to their
material.With the growth of the digital humanities, particularly in under-resourced
and underrepresented areas, a number of complex issues surface, including,
among others, questions of ownership, cultural theft, virtual exploitation,
digital rights, and the digital divide. We view the 2017 symposium as an
opportunity to broaden the conversation about these issues. Scholarship
that works across borders with foci on transnational partnerships and
globally accessible data is especially welcome.Michigan State University has been intentionally global
<http://www.isp.msu.edu/about/about-isp/> for more than 60 years, with over
1,400 faculty involved in international research, teaching, and service.
For the past 20 years, MSU has developed a strong research area in
culturally engaged, global digital humanities. Matrix
<http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/>, a digital humanities and social science
center at MSU, has done dozens of digital projects in West and Southern
Africa
<http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/portfolio_categories/africa-related-projects/>
that have focused on ethical and reciprocal relationships, and capacity
building. WIDE <http://wide.msu.edu/> has set best practices for doing
community engaged, international, archival work with the Samaritan
Collections, Archive 2.0
<http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/portfolio-item/samaritan-archive-2-0/>. Today
many scholars in the humanities at MSU are engaged in digital projects
relating to global, indigenous, and/or underrepresented groups and topics.This symposium, which will include a mixture of presentation types,
welcomes 300-word proposals related to any of these issues, and
particularly on the following themes and topics by Tuesday, December 13,
