2010 MARGOT conference, Digital Medievalist is now accepting papers for 
volume 7 of its on-line, refereed journal.We are asking for contributions of original research and scholarship 
that meet the mission statement of Digital Medievalist. Contributions 
should concern topics likely to be of interest to medievalists working 
with digital media, though they need not be exclusively medieval in 
focus. This includes notes on technological topics (markup and 
stylesheets, algorithms, tools and software, etc.), commentary pieces 
discussing developments in the field, bibliographic and review articles, 
and project reports. All contributions will be reviewed by authorities 
in humanities computing prior to publication.Journal submissions or enquiries should be emailed to: 
editors(a)digitalmedievalist.orgSubmissions guidelines are available at 
http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal/1.1/submission/With this forthcoming volume, we are re-establishing our "rolling issue" 
policy which means that contributions will be published as soon as they 
are ready for publication without firm deadlines. To allow inclusion in 
volume 7, however, submission before end of August 2011 is recommended.Digital Medievalist is an international web-based Community of Practice 
for medievalists working with digital media. Established in 2003, the 
project helps medievalists by providing a network for technical 
collaboration and instruction, exchange of expertise, and the 
development of best practice. The project operates an electronic mailing 
list and discussion forum, on-line refereed journal, news server for 
announcements and calls for papers, a wiki and FAQ. It also organises 
conference sessions at international medieval and humanities computing 
congresses. It is an elected organization and has developed some 
governing bylaws. The Digital Medievalist Project is overseen by an 
eight-member executive of medievalists with considerable experience in 
the use of digital media in the study of medieval topics. See our 
website at http://www.digitalmedievalist.org for more information.Malte Rehbein (Editor-In-Chief), Peter A. Stokes and Dan O'Donnell
