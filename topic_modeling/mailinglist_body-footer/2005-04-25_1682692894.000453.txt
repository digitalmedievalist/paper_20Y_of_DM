after much dealying I finally accepted the idea that I will need to use
a customized version of the TEI DTD for my project(s): I read the
guidelines, but would surely appreciate any further help, can anybody
point me to tutorials, examples etc. on the web? Has anybody had any
luck in using Roma? I couldn't save my modifications as a DTD, is it
going to remain a schema-only tool?Thanks in advance.Ciao
