Digital Ageat the University of Pennsylvania & The Free Library of PhiladelphiaOctober 21-22, 2011Writing the East: History and New Technologies in the Study of Asian
Manuscript TraditionsIn partnership with the Rare Book Department of the Free Library of
Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and
Anthropology, Penn Libraries are pleased to announce the 4th annual Lawrence
J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age. This
year's symposium will explore a range of issues relating to Asian reading
and writing cultures, especially as they pertain to the manuscript source.
Our focus will be on manuscripts from the Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist,
and Confucian traditions. We will bring together scholars representing these
traditions to examine the ways in which hand-produced texts shape both
meaning and interpretation, and to a larger extent, the cultural norms that
define their use.  We will also consider the role that modern digital
technology can play in facilitating the study of manuscripts today.  This
year's program will feature a special Friday afternoon workshop, "Bringing
Out the Best from Your Collections:  Ask the Experts!", on the care and
preservation of manuscripts and documents from Asian manuscript traditions.For more information and to register, go to:
