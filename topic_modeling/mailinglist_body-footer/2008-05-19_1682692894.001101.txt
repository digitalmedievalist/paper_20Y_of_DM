 Digital Medievalist Executive Board: *Burghart, Marjorie (Lyon)
 *Cummings, James (Oxford)
 *Porter, Dorothy Carr (Lexington, KY)
 *Rosselli Del Turco, Roberto (Torino) There were 35 total votes, or 9% of the DM listserv membership. The slate was strong and the election was quite close. Thanks very
 much to all the candidates and to these individuals for being willing
 to serve. The board has to thank especially Murray McGillivray who has been
 member of the Executive Board and dedicated his time to the project.- --
