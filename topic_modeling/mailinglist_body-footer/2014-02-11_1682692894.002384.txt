erable value to musicians, particularly to learners and teachers in classroom=
s or during private teaching.  The quantity and range of these technologies i=
s now considerable, such that, for instance, musicians have access to a wide =
range of sophisticated notation software that provides almost as many ways of=
 writing and editing music as are available in word processing.   The apps ca=
n be classified as pertaining to (a) the learning of content about music (b) =
the learning of the skills of performance (c) sharing performance and (d) cre=
ativity in music - with many sub-divisions in each section.The presentation will focus on the website - musicappsforlearning.weebly.com =
- in which the author has set out the apps according to the above classificat=
ion, and will briefly explain the most important features of some examples in=
 each category.  The value of most of these new technologies is very similar =
to the value of much of the newest software in the general:  to give musician=
s tools through which they can work more quickly and easily, and from which t=
hey can receive automated assistance.  For instance, there are apps that enab=
le transposition from one musical style to another, or that will flag up erro=
rs in playing a specific piece, or that exploit the power of multimedia.The general impact of these technologies is likely to be towards independence=
 of learning, performance, and creativity.  This in turn would enhance motiva=
tion among people - young or old - who might otherwise not expect to be able =
to learn or perform or compose music.
This will be an interactive seminar with audience participation encouraged, i=
.e. rather than talk followed by questions, we hope for an ongoing dialogue b=
etween speaker and audience members.
Speaker bio:  Anita Pincas is Visiting Fellow, formerly Senior lecturer, at t=
he Institute of Education, University of London.  Though not a musician, she =
takes an active interest in music learning and creativity, having a singer-so=
ngwriter son.  She has published on the comparison between language and music=
 as different modes of communication.  Her professional fields embrace most a=
reas of education, with a special focus on language learning, which, she feel=
s, is not a million miles away from music learning. Her major academic fields=
, in a long career, have been English language and literature, new technologi=
es especially those relevant to learning and online and/or distance education=
. She has taught and supervised at all levels from bachelors, through masters=
