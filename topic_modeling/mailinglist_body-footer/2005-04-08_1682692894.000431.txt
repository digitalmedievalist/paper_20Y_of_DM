a task dynamically, then we are forced into adopting one of several clunky
solutions.  James suggests that we introduce redundancy into the mix.  But
in so doing, we now are faced with issues of synchronization.  What happens
when changes are are made to the document?  Any change made to the "master"
must be reflected in all derived versions.  So one must either edit each of
the generated versions to include the change (which will almost guarantee
the loss of synchronization) or re-generate the reduced, and redundant,
versions of the document after any change.  Again, loss of synchronization
is bound to result (as it relies on a human being to remember to do this).
Indeed, any system that relies on the proper functioning of human beings
will surely fail at some point.  I agree with Peter Robinson.  A dynamic approach is always best./****************************************
