follow the 'view sample' links and you will see that Monarchia/NP/ 
PROME/Miller/Hengwrt all follow a similar style.  PROME is  
interesting here as it is rather different from the others, so you  
will see rather a lot of differences between PROME and the others:  
but even so, the overall frame is common.  There is a lot to be said  
about this issue: and we are conscious now of some deficiencies in  
this design.  It has served us well, however, and there is life in  
the dog still.  An advantage is that if you like one, you'll like  
them all -- but the reverse is also true.Two other publishers Dan does not mention are 'Rotunda': the  
University of Virginia Electronic Imprint , and the HRI online  
imprint of the University of Sheffield.  Rotunda seems to have a  
uniform approach to its 'letters' volumes, but I could not tell  
whether the Typee and Clotel volumes are similar.  HRI appears to  
tailor each interface for each publication.  But really, I have not  
done a very detailed look at what they have done, or for that matter  
at Rotunda.  Nor have I looked at any of the recent publications from  
SEENET.  Maybe someone else has looked at these more thoroughly than  
I have.
