r very early birds, is now open for the Sixth British Patristics conference.The conference will be held at the University of Birmingham from Monday 5th t=
o Wednesday 7th September 2016.
Proposals are invited for papers on any aspect of patristic study. We are par=
ticularly keen to receive contributions on the reception of Pauline literatur=
e or commentaries more generally. As in previous years, we expect to organise=
 two or three thematic sessions running in parallel. Proposals should be subm=
itted with an abstract of up to 250 words through the conference website by 3=
0th April 2016.The website, with all details and forms, is available at:
