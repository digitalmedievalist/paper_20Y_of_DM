two Canon 12 megapixel point-and-shoot cameras (SD 780). I am not convinced
that you need a DSLR camera for this (they are way to expensive and do not
necessarily provide a better image quality). I use them in combination with
some software (http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/sdm/index.htm) that allows to use a
usb switch to trigger both cameras at the same time (you get two pages -
left and right - in the same instance and 12 megapixel is quite enough for
up to A4 format). Thus, I end up with two flashcards holding left and right
pages separately. There are programs which allow to renames images in
batches (so,  I rename all right images as XXXX-1 and left images as XXXX-2,
where XXXX are automatically generated numbers). Then, copy them into one
folder and they are automatically arranged. Then, for processing images I
found an excellent freeware program, ScanTailor, that does a great job -
most of it automatically - processing images into nice looking pages (
http://scantailor.sourceforge.net/), which then can be combined into a very
nice looking PDF.Maxim2010/10/27 Neven JovanoviÄ‡ <neven.jovanovic(a)ffzg.hr>> Hi,
