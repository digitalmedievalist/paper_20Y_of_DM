2474-3135) (www.walkingtheworlds.com) is seeking articles for its Winter
2017 issue. This is a journal dedicated to the intellectual exploration of
ancient and modern Polytheisms, polytheology, and contemporary Pagan
religions. The journal is published twice a year. Submission guidelines may
be found here: https://walkingtheworlds.com/submission-guidelines/.The theme for the Winter 2017 issue is "Text and Tradition." Of particular
interest in the context of reconstructionist polytheisms like Heathenry,
Asatru, Kemeticism and Hellenismos, as well as polytheisms continuous from
antiquity, this issue will seek to explore the ways in which polytheisms
engage with literary sources, devotional texts, and the role that textual
exegesis plays in the development of ancient and modern cultus.The deadline for this issue is December 1, 2017. Submissions should be sent
to Galina Krasskova at krasskova(a)gmail.com or Edward Butler at
