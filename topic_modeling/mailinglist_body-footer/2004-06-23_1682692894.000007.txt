to choose what parser it uses, but I'm assuming it is a .NET program
which makes that more difficult.  There is no reason to not use
that for the types of conversions it uses and a sensible parser
like saxon ( http://saxon.sf.net ) for real transformations.> For those who don't know what I am talking about: XSLT (eXtensible

has lots, but
doesn't give much explanation.http://www.dictionary.com/ has less acronyms (though all the ones
you mentioned) but usually links to better definitions.Thanks for setting up the list,-James
