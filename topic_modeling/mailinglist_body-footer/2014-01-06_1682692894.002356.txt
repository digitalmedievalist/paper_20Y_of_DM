esearch into the ancient world that employs digital and other quantitative me=
thods. The seminars, hosted by the Institute of Classical Studies, are on Fri=
day afternoons from June to mid-August in Senate House, London.We welcome contributions from students as well as from established researcher=
s and practitioners. We welcome high-quality papers discussing individual pro=
jects and their immediate context, but also accommodate broader theoretical c=
onsideration of the use of digital technology in Classical studies. The conte=
nt should be of interest both to classicists, ancient historians or archaeolo=
gists, and to information specialists or digital humanists, and should have a=
n academic research agenda relevant to at least one of those fields.There is a budget to assist with travel to London (usually from within the UK=
, but we have occasionally been able to assist international presenters to at=
tend).To submit a proposal for consideration, email an abstract of approximately 50=
0 words to s.mahony(a)ucl.ac.uk by midnight UTC on March 9th, 2014.Further information and details of past seminars are available at: http://www=
