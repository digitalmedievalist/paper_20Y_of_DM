humanities computing. Of course, there exist a couple of good examples like 
the TEI XSLT style sheets or some open source archival software etc. 
Nevertheless, the situation is not satisfactory and I wonder what are its 
causes and by which means it could possibly be improved.  Briefly 
summarized the main causes, I can think of, are the following:- Most software development in the humanities takes place in an ad hoc 
fashion: People have specific problems and develop specific solutions.
- There is a lack of institutional support for developing tools for others. 
Tools are only by-products.
- If there is institutional support for developing tools for others, these 
tools need to be sold in order to re-finance the work.
- It is not advisable for a scholar trying to build an academic career on 
developing tools for humanities computing.
- There exists no academic infrastructure *focused* on developing tools for 
the humanities, ie. a specific society, journal and annual conference.Since one of my main research interests is considered with the development 
of tools for humanities computing, I would be very interested in the 
opinions of others on the above list of causes. Perhaps together we could 
find ways to improve the situation.Dieter KÃ¶hlerInstitute of Philosophy and
