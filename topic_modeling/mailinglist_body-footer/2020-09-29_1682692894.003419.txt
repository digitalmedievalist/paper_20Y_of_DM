t few months.1. The iconography of manuscripts from French libraries in the Biblissima Por=
tal:The data from Initiale, the catalogue of illuminated manuscripts from the Mid=
dle Ages maintained by the IRHT-CNRS, can now be consulted in the Biblissima =
Portal [1], thus joining those of the Mandragore database (Biblioth√©que =
nationale de France). More than 306,000 records of illuminations and decorati=
on elements can be consulted through a common interface, representing at this=
 stage a corpus of approx. 230,000 digital images accessible via IIIF protoco=
ls. For more details, read this Twitter feed [2]. The Portal home page offers=
 a thematic entry point [3] into this large iconographic corpus.2. Publication of a repository of quotations for ancient manuscripts and prin=
ted works:Biblissima's shelfmarks authority file has been published on data.biblissima.=
fr<http://data.biblissima.fr>, the Biblissima authority data platform [4]. To=
 date, it references nearly 200,000 shelfmarks from various catalogues and da=
tabases from Biblissima's partners, progressively integrated into the Portal =
since 2017, and from the datasets aggregated into the IIIF-Collections search=
 engine. The creation of this authority file responds to the need to unambigu=
ously and uniformly identify manuscripts and printed books thanks to a stable=
 and unique URI identifier that acts as the indispensable pivot for aggregati=
ng metadata about the same object.3. Enrichments of the IIIF-Collections of Manuscripts and Rare Books search e=
ngine:IIIF-Collections, the search platform for digitised manuscripts and rare book=
s, aggregates data from 17 digital libraries and allows a federated search on=
 more than 75,000 records [5]. The last two datasets that have been processed=
 and integrated this month come from the Badische Landesbibliothek Karlsruhe =
and the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto.We remain open to any collaboration on shared entity files in the fields cove=
red by Biblissima, and for the integration of new resources in its Portal.The Biblissima Team.Campus Condorcet
