http://junicode.sourceforge.net.These are the major changes:* By request, improved handling of Turkish and some Eastern European 
languages.* Small caps in the bold face.* Capital Eszett at U+1E9E in all four faces now; also a small cap 
version accessible via OpenType feature c2sc.* Obsolete MUFI characters (for some three years now rendered unusable 
by a superimposed x) have been removed.* Various characters added by user request.* The usual bug fixes (minor) and outline cleanups.Thanks to all those who have left recommendations and reviews. As 
always, bug reports and feature requests are welcome.Peter Baker
