Hi Matthew,On the DM-L listinfo page at:
http://listserv.uleth.ca/mailman/listinfo/dm-lYou can view archives but currently the subscriber list is only
available to list admins.This could be changed to allow list subscribers to view the roster, or
indeed make it entirely public.  I think we decided to err on the side
of caution with respect to this rather than give people's email
addresses up to lots of spam-bots.  Is there any sort of general
feeling that we should open the list membership roster to viewing by
subscribed individuals?  Membership is moderated, in that we try not
to approve random looking email addresses or those that really look
like spam-bots.-james
