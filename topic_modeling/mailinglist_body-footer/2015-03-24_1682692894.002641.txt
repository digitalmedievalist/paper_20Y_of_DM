embarking on a project to digitally reconstruct the Beauvais Missal, a
beautiful late thirteenth-century French manuscript that was dismembered
by dealer Philip Duschnes in 1942 and sold off leaf by leaf by Duschnes
and Otto Ege. I have published my handlist of more than eighty known
leaves in my latest blog post:https://manuscriptroadtrip.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/manuscript-road-trip-reco=
nstructing-the-beauvais-missal/Please take a look and let me know if you know of any leaves I may have
missed!Many thanks -Lisa--=20
