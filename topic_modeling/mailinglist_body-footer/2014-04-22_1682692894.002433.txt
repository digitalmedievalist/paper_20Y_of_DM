that it is now accepting applications from electronic projects and
resources wishing to join the federation. Information on our review process
and the submission workflow may be found at
http://www.mesa-medieval.org/about/peer-review/
<http://www.mesa-medieval.org/about/peer-review/> MESA has instituted a new
two-tier review process. All projects must undergo a process of open review
to ensure that scholarly and technological standards are met. An optional
second tier is available for scholars who wish to have a more traditional
review process for purposes such as tenure and promotion and will be
overseen by our editorial board
<http://www.mesa-medieval.org/about/leadership/>. *All conversations
pertaining to open review will be conducted on the MESA listserv. In order
to subscribe, please send an email to mj2(a)lists.ncsu.edu with the following
text in the body of the message:  subscribe mesa.* We encourage both established projects and those nearing publication to
apply. Please address questions or comments to mesamedieval(a)gmail.com
