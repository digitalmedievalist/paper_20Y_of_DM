Subject: [dm-l] An edition in an app: the General Prologue of the Canterbury =
TalesThe General Prologue in an app: with a full performance, manuscript images, t=
ranslation, new text, commentary and notes, and new scholarship.3rd February marks the release of the first ever app, specifically designed f=
or mobile phone and tablet, to present significant new scholarly work in an e=
dition of a major literary work: the General Prologue of Geoffrey Chaucer's C=
anterbury Tales. Go to PlayStore (Android) or the App Store (Apple/IoS) and l=
ook for =E2=80=9CChaucer General Prologue=E2=80=9D (Scholarly Digital Edition=
s). Or, go to http://www.sd-editions.com/CantApp/GP/. Press the play icon.This app includes a new biography of Chaucer by Richard North (UCL), a new te=
xt edited by Barbara Bordalejo (USask), Terry Jones's translation of =
the General Prologue, additional materials about the Tales by Peter Robinson =
(who created the app), images of the Hengwrt manuscript form the National Lib=
rary of Wales, and a full performance of the text by University of Saskatchew=
an and University of Calgary student Colin Gibbings. Among much else: the ful=
l commentary and notes by Richard North suggest a new dating for the referenc=
e to the seige of Algezir, which makes the Knight significantly younger at th=
e time of the composition of the General Prologue.The app is designed to appeal to people interested in Chaucer at every level,=
 from beginning students to advanced scholars. We plan future apps in this se=
ries.The app also celebrates Terry Jones, who was both a distinguished medieval sc=
holar and a Python. As well as contribute his translation of the General Prol=
ogue, he was much involved in the early planning of the app, hosting the team=
 to a memorable lunch at a pub in North London. We are happy that we were abl=
e to show him the full app in the last weeks of his life.We attach the University of Saskatchewan press release about the app. Readers=
 might also be interested in the Canterbury Tales project, atwww.textualcommu=
nities.org<http://www.textualcommunities.org> (click on the link to the Cante=
rbury Tales project). This offers images of all 30,000 manuscript pages of th=
e Tales, with transcripts of some 24,000 pages. The work of this project unde=
rlies the app.Peter Robinson and Barbara Bordalejo (University of Saskatchewan), Richard No=
rth (University College London). With Terry Jones (Python)
