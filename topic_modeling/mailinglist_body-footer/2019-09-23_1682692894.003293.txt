GROWING CORPORA
Byzantine Book Epigrams and Online Text Collections
________________________________Ghent, 24-25 June 2020Since 2010, the Database of Byzantine Book Epigrams team (that is: we) have b=
een growing an online corpus of metrical paratexts, several of which were pre=
viously unpublished or unknown altogether, and made them freely available to =
the scholarly community (that is: you).A new version of our database (https://www.dbbe.ugent.be<https://www.dbbe.uge=
nt.be/>) was launched in June 2019. Exactly one year later, we are organising=
 a two-day conference. Together with anyone interested in this particular gen=
re of Byzantine poetry, we want to celebrate and reflect on what we have achi=
eved so far and look ahead at what is =E2=80=93 hopefully! =E2=80=93 yet to c=
ome. Moreover, we want to stimulate communication and collaboration with othe=
r projects that are growing online corpora of texts.You can partake in two different types of sessions.In our demo sessions you can present your project and discuss your experience=
s in growing your online corpus (10-15 minutes). We are confident this will l=
ead to a lively discussion on challenges we all face, such as data presentati=
on, interoperability, and sustainability.In our thematic sessions you can present your research on Byzantine book epig=
rams (20 minutes). Possible topics include:  *   editing book epigrams;
  *   theoretical reflections on the concept of book epigrams and other metri=
cal paratexts;
  *   book epigrams as a way to study the history of manuscripts;
  *   visual aspects of book epigrams;
  *   literary texts that function (or may have functioned) as book epigrams;
  *   metre and language of book epigrams;
  *   book epigrams in languages other than Greek.We especially welcome contributions inspired by the Database of Byzantine Boo=
k Epigrams.Confirmed speakers<https://www.dbbe2020.ugent.be/programme/> include Georgi P=
arpulov (University of Birmingham) and Andreas Rhoby (Austrian Academy of Sci=
ences).Interested? Send us an abstract (up to 300 words, PDF) by 15 November 2019 (d=
bbe(a)ugent.be<mailto:dbbe(a)ugent.be>, subject =E2=80=9CGrowing Corpora =E2=
=80=93 abstract=E2=80=9D) and we will get back to you early December.Note that we want our conference to reflect who we are as a team<https://www.=
dbbe.ugent.be/pages/team>: welcoming and inclusive. Costs will be kept to a m=
inimum and we are working hard to secure funding to support anyone for whom t=
raveling might not be evident, including early career or independent scholars=
 and carers of young children.For any further information, please visit our conference website (https://www=
.dbbe2020.ugent.be<https://www.dbbe2020.ugent.be/>).
