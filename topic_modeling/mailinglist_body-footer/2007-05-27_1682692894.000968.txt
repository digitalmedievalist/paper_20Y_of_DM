ian is also responsible for following the open source "market" for Open Sourc=
e Watch and so has his finger on the pulse, so to speak.2)If you have never tried Linux before, this disk is an interesting way to tr=
y: you load it in your CD drive, reboot your computer, and your computer runs=
 as a Linux computer from the CD-ROM--i.e. without changing anything on your =
hard drive. It uses Ubuntu which is among the most popular version of Linux a=
nd is also extremely good and user friendly. And if you end up liking what yo=
u see, you can use the same disk to install Ubuntu to your computer's hard dr=
ive--while keeping your Mac or Windows Operating system as well if you wish (=
i.e. when you start up you are asked what you'd prefer to use). If you've eve=
r installed or reinstalled Windows on a computer, then you will be pleased to=
 know that installing Ubuntu is nothing like that horror: it has a very frien=
dly and easy to use graphic user interface that guides the installation. But =
if you just run it from the CD-ROM, you won't even have to worry about that.

=20
http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/teideb/tei-Ubuntu.iso is an image of a TEI=20
customization
of the Ubuntu Live CD (Feisty series) for Intel PC. Grab a copy, make a CD
from it, reboot your PC from the CD, and you should find yourself
in a nice Linux system with the latest and greatest TEI-everything=20
installed.
It includes a state of the art eXist XML database system running with=20
various
TEI documents preloaded.I make these CDs mainly for teaching purposes, but it can also be used
as an install medium to set up a new computer with a running Ubuntu
system.As I have said before, if you have some nice software which should/can be
be on here, let me know.  There are three conditions:
 * it can't need _too_ much space
 * it must have an open source licence according to OSI definitions, and
    data files must be completely free (no "nocommercial" clauses)
 * it must be set up as a Debian package or something close (no "its got
   its own copy of Tomcat and Java with it")--=20
