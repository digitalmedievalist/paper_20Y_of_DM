there will be a Digital Classicist Wiki sprint. Interested parties will 
gather in the #digiclass IRC chatroom 
(http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/DigiClass_IRC_Channel) at any time in 
the two-hour slot, and contribute to work improving the wiki content.This may include:
  * adding new project descriptions, or improving existing ones, or 
approaching relevant experts to add their own project information;
  * adding new tool descriptions;
  * longitudinally rationalizing the use of categories in the Wiki;
  * adding other descriptive or supporting information to the Wiki as 
required.Last month some good work on categories was achieved (see now 
http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Special:Categories). Some areas still 
need more work (e.g. linguistics; Byzantine; archaeology; Near Eastern 
languages).All welcome,Gabby--
