>         On Tuesday (11th July) Iâ€™m attending a workshop on repurposing
>         digital text
>         archives. One thing that they are particularly interested in
>         is how digital
>         texts might be used in teaching.
>         
>         Do any of you use digital texts (any language) in your
>         teaching and if so in
>         what way? Is it something that you use only in class or is it
>         that you set
>         students learning tasks to do using those digital texts? 
>         
>         Any input you can give would be very gratefully received.
>         Please give as
>         much detail as you can. I guess this needs to be placed in a
>         pedagogical
>         context rather than just the convenience of being able to
>         download and look
>         at texts online.
