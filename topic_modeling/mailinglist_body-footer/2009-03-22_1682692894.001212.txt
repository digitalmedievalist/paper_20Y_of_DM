discussion on ANSAX-L, now copied to DM-L, the interedition project is
indeed up and running, and is funded until April 2012.  As a COST
action no work is funded on the project -- that is donated by those
participating in the action -- but some expenses for meetings. The
action has recently had a meeting and developer's boot-camp where work
started in earnest on one of the prototypes (a collation engine).  The
project website is http://www.interedition.eu/Hope that helps,-James

Subject: Re: [ANSAX-L] Digital Edition InterfacesThank's Marcin.  Problem is, the site was last updated November 28th,
2007. Is EU STILL financing it? That would certainly be a powerful arm
to support it.
