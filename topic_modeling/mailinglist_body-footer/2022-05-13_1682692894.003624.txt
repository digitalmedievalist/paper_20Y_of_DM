MIRABILE-A TLAS FELLOWSHIPS IN D IGITAL HUMANITIES
OF THE ZENO KARL SCHINDLER FOUNDATIONThe Zeno Karl Schindler Foundation
[http://www.zenokarlschindler-foundation.ch] has established two
fellowships, each of them for six to twelve months, to support the
development of the =C2=ABMIRABILE. Digital Archive for Medieval Latin
Culture=C2=BB [www.mirabileweb.it] project maintained by SISMEL
(International Society for the Study of Medieval Latin, Via Montebello
7, I-50123 Florence www.sismelfirenze.it). It is intended that the
fellows will carry out their fellowships at the seat of the
SISMEL following the development agenda of the MIRABILE project, with a
monthly stipend of CHF 2,500 (Swiss francs).Applications should be submitted (with curriculum vitae and motivation
letter) by July 1, 2022 via email to: Prof. Jean-Yves Tilliette
(Jean-Yves.Tilliette(a)unige.ch).
The results of the evaluation procedure will be published by August 31,
2022.
Winners will be given the opportunity to start the fellowship from the
beginning of October
1st, 2022.MIRABILE-ATLAS Fellowship core objectives
1. On-line publication, with related search functions for the search and
visualization, of data present in MIRABILE on an atlas of medieval
culture with related cross-searches and interactive navigation over the
data retrieved from the database. All data will be transformed in JSON,
which is the standard format for the management of data used by Elastic
Search for indexing.2. Integration with information present in MIRABILE's databases (such as
the author, the texts, the manuscripts that conserve them and the
bibliography). The development of this new
module will provide the ability to show those database informations on a
map. The geographical data will be loaded by the user inserting it in a
text field. To facilitate the user, a lemmatization algorithm will be
used, it will analyze the text contained in the document by detecting
the entries in it.3. A user interface that will integrate the search engine results, will
be implemented in the new project, providing a way to view the data on
an interactive map.
