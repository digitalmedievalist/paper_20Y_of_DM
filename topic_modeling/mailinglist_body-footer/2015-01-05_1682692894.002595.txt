Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts at the
University of Pennsylvania Libraries, July 22-24, 2015. Dr. Miriam Posner,
Coordinator and Core Faculty of the Digital Humanities Program at UCLA,
will be presenting the keynote lecture, “What's Next?: The Radical,
Unrealized Potential of Digital Humanities.”Proposals are now invited for long presentations (20 minutes), short
presentations (7 minutes), and project showcases (10 minutes) in all areas
of digital humanities.Presentations may take the form of interactive presentations, short papers,
project demos, panel discussions, or workshops. We welcome proposals from
emerging and veteran students, teachers, and scholars.The community will be invited to vote on proposals that they would like to
see included in the program. The 10 proposals with the highest scores are
guaranteed a slot at the conference. The Program Committee will curate the
remainder of the program in an effort to ensure diversity in program
content and presenters. Community votes will, of course, still weigh
heavily in these decisions.Please send your name, email address, and a proposal of 200-300 words to
keystonedh.conference(a)gmail.com. The proposal deadline is January 12, 2015,
and community peer review will run from January 15-February 15. Proposers
will be notified by March 1.The Association for Computers and the Humanities (http://ach.org/) is
covering registration for ten graduate students to present at the
conference.Conference Organizing CommitteeDawn Childress, Penn State University
