Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear All,As part of the Balisage Symposium on Cultural Heritage Markup, we want to hav=
e an "inverted" paper session where the talks are short and there is lots of =
time for discussion and debate after each talk. I think this is going to be p=
erhaps the most interesting session of the day, so please join in!=20Full text and submission details at http://balisage.net/CulturalHeritage/Shor=
t-Talks-call.html=20Cultural Heritage data tend to be complex and heterogeneous; they resist gene=
ric solutions and often push tools and standards to the edges of their capabi=
lities. Complex problems would seem to demand complex solutions, but as Gall'=
s Law points out: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have ev=
olved from a simple system that worked."=20The Balisage Symposium on Cultural Heritage Markup invites proposals for shor=
t presentations that aim to provoke discussion of how to design for and cope =
with the complexity of Cultural Heritage materials. Do you have a markup prob=
lem with no solution? Data too messy for your tools to handle? An ingenious s=
olution to a hard problem involving Cultural Heritage materials? A heretical =
point of view about existing standards and practices? We want to hear from yo=
u!=20Presentations will be 10 minutes (or less) in length, followed by open discus=
sion, brainstorming, support, sympathy, and advice from our audience of marku=
p experts.To propose a short presentation for the Symposium on Cultural Heritage Markup=
 send email to info(a)balisage.net. Proposals must be received by June 19, 20=
15. Selection decisions will be announced by June 23, 2015.
