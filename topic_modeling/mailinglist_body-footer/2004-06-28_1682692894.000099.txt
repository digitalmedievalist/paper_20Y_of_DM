universe and especially to users, i have to agree with you entirely, 
here. i've had no trouble at all on NT networks since installing X. i 
could even take my ibook from network to network with no reboots and no 
crashes. of course, apple has always been better at playing nice with 
windows than the other way around, but that, as you say, is the nature 
of the beast.j
