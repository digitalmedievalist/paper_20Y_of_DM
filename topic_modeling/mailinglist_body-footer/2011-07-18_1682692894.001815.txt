Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear James et al.,Many thanks for letting us know (and for taking part in creating Cursus). =20
There's probably a lesson to be learnt regarding future projects, their =20
storage and copyrights.On a more practical note - is there a person / email address to whom I can =20
write, asking for the database to be reinstated? Perhaps OTHER MEMBERS OF =20
THE DM-L may want to send an email as well, demonstrating to the UEA the =20
value of the database and its appeal to the wider academic public.CheersEyal
