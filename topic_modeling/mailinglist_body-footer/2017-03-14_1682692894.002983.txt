Digital Cultural Heritage
April 12 & 13, 2017
University of Graz, RESOWI (Universitätsstra=C3=9Fe 15)
http://informationsmodellierung.uni-graz.at/de/veranstaltungen/coopyright/The conference is hosted by the Centre for Information Modelling -
Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and the Institute of the
Foundations of Law, Section 'Law and ICT' at the University of Graz
(Austria).
In the age of digital information technology and the constant
availability of information through the Internet, it is not only
important to have democratic access to knowledge, but also essential to
consider the potential that lies in the critical production and
expansion of knowledge.
The CO:OP project - short for Community as Opportunity: the creative
archives' and users' network<http://coop-project.eu/> - co-funded by the
Creative Europe programme of the European Union aims to strengthen and
promote the co-operation between institutions preserving our common
cultural heritage and the general public.
Of particular interest and concern to cultural heritage institutions are
issues of copyright on, provision of and access to digitized material.
There is a recognizable political drive in the European Union to
facilitate public access to cultural heritage - and data in general -
hosted at public institutions. However, the lack of  legal harmonization
and the often unclear national legislations on the use and provision of
resources by public cultural  heritage or scientific institutions has
been prohibiting a much broader engagement between the general public
and its own cultural heritage.The conference includes three pre-conference workshops and a full day of
presentations by both legal experts and cultural heritage experts.

registration is required. Please register at:
