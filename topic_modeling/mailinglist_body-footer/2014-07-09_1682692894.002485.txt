Retracing Theban Witness Networks in Demotic ContractsALL WELCOMEThis paper focuses on the presence of witnesses in Demotic contracts 
during the Ptolemaic reign in Egypt. It will investigate the 
interpersonal links between the three main actor groups of these 
contracts: the scribes, the two contracting parties and the witnesses. 
The first actors, i.e. the scribes, have been studied before and we saw 
them connected through family ties, revealing the profession of a 
contract scribe as a hereditary office associated with the Egyptian 
temples. In the second century BC two operational notaries were attested 
in Thebes: the notary of Amunrasonther and that of the prophets of 
Djeme. But what about the period before that? Can we retrace these 
notaries through network analysis or are we confronted with an 
organisation entirely different from the one in the following century? 
The contracting parties have always received a lot of attention from 
papyrologists as well, as they were often the protagonists of important 
archives. However, the third group of actors, the witnesses, have more 
or less been neglected so far. I will try to provide an answer to the 
crucial question of how these witnesses were chosen. Were they connected 
to the notarial and scribal offices, or can they be linked to one or 
both parties as family and/or acquaintances perhaps? Or were they chosen 
randomly, passers-by simply picked from the streets when needed? The 
online platform Trismegistos, which includes almost half a million 
attestations of individuals in Greek and Egyptian texts between 800 BC 
and AD 800, serves as a starting point for this research. Thanks to the 
interlock structure of the text and reference databases, a two-mode 
people-in-texts network can easily be extracted and converted into 
one-mode people-to-people networks of the contracting parties, the 
scribes and the witnesses.Firstly, before we can start interpreting these networks, we need to 
make sure that we have correctly identified the various actors appearing 
in our network. The visualisation of the data has proven to be a very 
useful new step in this process. Where before we were looking at the 
actors' fathers and the characteristics of the relevant texts, we now 
take the position of an actor in the – albeit preliminary – network into 
account as an extra factor to obtain a faster and more advanced 
identification.Secondly, subjecting these networks to social network analysis will 
contribute to our understanding of the relationships and interactions 
between witnesses, scribes and contracting parties as well as the 
functioning of the ancient notaries, not only in Thebes but in the whole 
of Ptolemaic Egypt.*The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.*For more information please see the seminar website at
