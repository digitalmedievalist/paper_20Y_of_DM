experience with it is a bit dated.  It isn't terribly hard to set up =20
an authentication system for it if you know Java--basically you create =20
some sort of Action that does your authentication/authorization and =20
then wrap the pipelines you want protected in that.You get a lot out of the box with frameworks like Django, but I think =20
you're right that there would be a lot to learn and rebuild if you've =20
already got a working system.So if your needs are simple right now, why not just use .htpasswd?  =20
It's fairly easy to set up Apache as a front to Tomcat, using mod_jk =20
(see http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/generic_howto/=20
quick.html), and then you can do it the way you're used to.HughOn Aug 26, 2009, at 12:44 AM, Daniel Paul O'Donnell wrote:> Thanks Martin!
