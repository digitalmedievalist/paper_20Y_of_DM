Title: The (Data) Science of Time: From Music to the Heart
Abstract:The explosion of data in the music industry and technological 
developments in musical instruments that can record performance nuances 
have made possible modern investigations into intangible properties of 
music such as expressivity. How do musicians shape performances?  How 
are masterful interpretations crafted?  What are the decisions that 
define a performance? What is the process of musicking: performing and 
listening?  These have all become quantifiable and subject to scientific 
probing.The consequent ability to capture and model the rhythmic 
variations of performance transfers to other music-like systems like the 
human heart. This enables descriptions of individual experiences of 
cardiac arrhythmias, personalised diagnoses, and disease or risk 
stratification. Elaine Chew will present and discuss mathematical models 
of time, timing and temporal structure in music and heart data, with 
demonstrations at a piano.We are looking forward to seeing you! Registration for the event is not

The lecture series introduces international scientists with talks about 
their views on the possibilities and challenges of data science in their 
respective fields. We aim to reach a broad audience from various 
scientific backgrounds as well as the industry – from students to 
lecturers right up to entrepreneurs and interested parties and 
individuals. The next lecturers will be Elaine Chew, professor for 
digital media from the Queen Mary University in London (January 17^th 
2019) and Gudrun Gersmann, professor for history from the University of 
Cologne (April 4^th 2019).About us :
Data Science @ Uni Vienna is a new research platform at the University 
of Vienna that presents a hub on all activities in data science at the 
University of Vienna. Our primary focus is to bring researchers from 
different areas together to work on and solve several of the challenges 
that this new field presents. We specifically focus on problems arising 
in one of the following five domains, Astronomy, Digital Humanities, 
Finance, Industry 4.0, Medical Sciences.  While these areas are broad, 
they have in common that they are data-driven and use similar methods 
from computer science, mathematics, and statistics.Further information: https://datascience.univie.ac.at/lecture-series/Twitter: https://twitter.com/dsUniVie--
