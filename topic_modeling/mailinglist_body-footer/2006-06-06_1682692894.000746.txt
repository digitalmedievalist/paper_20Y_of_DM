intentional example of this, and "dord" for an accidental instance.I've asked a US English dictionary editor about Dot's question, and she repli=
ed:"[L]emmata are not copyrightable, unless they do not exist other
places (like the copyright trap with esquivalience). As long as they
can show that they know of the words' existence in another text, I'd
say they were fine."Another existing example that his would not be a problem, is the case
of Scrabble wordlists.  Merriam-Webster's Official Scrabble Players
Dictionary is itself a compilation of the wordlists of 15 US college
dictionaries, and it is surely protected by all sort of nasty
copyright.  But on the internet there are readily available lists of
legal words from all Scrabble jurisdictions.Your use would be quite transformative, educational, and a factual
statement in the vein of a concordance or index.> Or do I really need to talk to a lawyer?It wouldn't hurt, as long as you don't take "no" for an answer.  Cfr.
