en***The realization of a complete census of the Florentine accounting sources is =
the last step of a long research, started almost fifty years ago. The main cr=
edits go to Richard Goldthwaite and Marco Spallanzani who have been collectin=
g throughout their research careers a huge amount of data from public and pri=
vate archives. Thanks to a grant funded by Ca'Foscari University of V=
enice, the original dataset has been revised and extended by Francesco Bettar=
ini and recently converted into an actual database by Daniele Fusi. It now re=
cords more than 3000 items, with detailed information concerning the acts, da=
tation, families involved, type of economic activities, archival location and=
 more.
The census will be published online to make it accessible to a large communit=
y of scholars in the social and economic history of Renaissance Florence and =
beyond. It will serve as a hub of materials and data on accounting documents =
by linking them to an ever growing landscape of online resources, e.g. collec=
tions of digital facsimiles and editions, as they will become available over =
time.--Franz Fischer
