> TODD M. RESTER, CALVIN THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY A Digital Researcher's
> Toolkit: Sive, Ad Fontes, Renatos ac Digitaliter Acquisitos
>
> The paper was accompanied by slides and detailed description on how to
> assemble a light field kit for making digital photos, complete with a
> stand and a connection to computer (you control the camera from the
> computer).  Later, Todd shared the slides with me, which I can pass on to

> We used Todd's recipes to put together a similar kit and photograph a
> three-volume Bible in the field (a Franciscan monastery).  I can tell you
> that nothing can beat sunlight, and that getting the values of exposure
> and film sensitivity just right is an art. In the end we just stuck to
> defaults, and got quite acceptable results.  But having a direct
> connection to the computer was very practical.
