http://www.ancientwisdoms.ac.uk/
We will date-stamp our editions, since we have no further funding to continue=
 work on the project. But we do expect further responses/improvements/informa=
tion. I'm proposing to open a blog, accessible from the site, and linked to t=
he text for which I am responsible: I expect to invite, and post, comments fo=
r ?5 years - by which time the landscape will doubtless be very different (an=
d I will be retired!)Does that sound sensible/useful?CharlotteOn 20 Jun 2013, at 19:15, Marjorie Burghart wrote:Dear Andreas,
Regarding an academic community, I would personally prefer
a) a mailing list to seriously discuss some topics, aided by
b) a facebook group for quick news and commentsI suppose I am very old fashioned, but mailing lists are my definitive favour=

- Blogs: I don't give a fig about blogs as a means of regular information. I =
do not follow any. Of course I read blog posts sometimes, when  they are poin=
ted out to me or when hey come up in a web search, but I do not *follow* any =
blog.
- Wiki sites: I just don't trust them.
- Social networks: you do have a point  about the segmentation; I use Faceboo=
k a lot for both professional and personal contacts, and I have an academia.e=
du<http://academia.edu/> account, but I don't use it very actively and do not=
 wish to have to follow news and posts on several networks.
- Bulletin boards: they work well for some communities, but I don't feel that=
 academic communities have the right balance of news and debates to work well=
 on BB.
- Twitter: not good for academic communities IMHO.Interesting question, Andreas! :)

 17th centuries), what type of platform would you prefer, and why? Blog, Mail=

How do you perceive access and participation thresholds, popularity/dissemina=

contradict and challenge (or confirm) based on your experiences, or your intu=

tend to have a restriced set of authors. Can anyone imagine   applying for au=
thorship rights to a blog administration in order to   just pose one question=
 or to advertise one conference?- The same holds for wiki sites.- Social networks like academia.edu<http://academia.edu/>, itergateway groups=
 etc. depend on   people to focus on one such network which might not be thei=
r favorite   one, so a too large portion of interested persons is kept out.- Bulletin Boards are a mess.- Twitter messages are too short.- Mailing lists are not subscribed to because they look old-fashioned.   Bein=
g somewhat nerdy myself, they are my personal favorites, however.On the other hand, when I have asked that same question on my facebook profil=
e, the only response I did get was a suggestion to go for a blog. In other so=
cial networks or fora (academia.edu<http://academia.edu/>, community.itergate=
way.org<http://community.itergateway.org/>, researchgate.net<http://researchg=
