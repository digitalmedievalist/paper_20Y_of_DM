Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Colleagues,Without inviting a deluge of personal opinions or advocacy, I am wondering if=
 anyone could inform me of the current state of legal decisions regarding cop=
yright of critical editions of medieval texts. In other words, I am just curi=
ous about the current legal status of such copyright (in any legal context, U=
S, UK, EU, etc).I read recently of this decision in France which may be relevant (http://apoc=
ryphes.hypotheses.org/389) and was wondering if perhaps there were any recent=
 publications in the field of DH, law, or cultural heritage preservation that=
 tried to summarize the current legal landscape. Some what discouragingly, a =
top English language google search for this topic (https://www.google.com/sea=
rch?q=3DCopyright+Status+of+Edited+Ancient+Texts&ie=3Dutf-8&oe=3Dutf-8) retur=
ns a page from 1995, so this is an issue that has been a developing question =
for a while.p.s. apologies for cross-posting to Digital Classicist members, but it seems =
that list may also have some input.Best,David A. MichelsonAssistant Professor of the History of Christianity
