edral's St Chad Gospels available online, with plans to have the complete man=
uscript up by summer's end: http://lichfield.as.uky.edu . This is a beta vers=
ion but very stable. Chrome offers the best 3D support for browsers, but Safa=
ri works well as does Opera. Foxfire and Internet Explorer should have the ne=
cessary support in their next releases.Features include the ability to measure any aspect of a page, offering seven =
different measurements (by color) and each measurement able to comprise multi=
ple points (for a point, line or polygon); allowing viewers to generate a URL=
 for an exact view that they have manipulated a 3D rendering into for later r=
eturn or to send to a colleague or friend (or for citation); annotate any fea=
ture on a page and save it to the server, loading it and its view later (I ha=
ve an annotation for page 5, the Chi-Rho); and my favorite viewing feature=E2=
=80=94by holding down the alt key, left clicking the mouse and dragging it, t=
he cursor location becomes the point around which the page rotates (potential=
ly making any point on a page its own epicenter).There is a key at the top of the viewer for the 3D images giving the various =
functions and movements, including full-screen mode, panning the camera, zoom=
ing in and out, and dragging the image (by clicking and holding down the mous=
ewheel=E2=80=94we'll have a keystroke for this movement soon so that all of t=
he functionality will work on the touchpad of a laptop.If anyone has any comments or suggestions, please contact me: bill.endres(a)u=
ky.edu .Best,
Bill--
