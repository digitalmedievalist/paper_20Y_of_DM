nts. This peer-reviewed journal is open to contributions that rely on both tr=
aditional methodologies of manuscript study and those that explore the potent=

tellectual heritage. Studies that incorporate digital methodologies to furthe=
r understanding of the physical and conceptual structures of the manuscript b=
ook are encouraged. A separate section, entitled Annotations, features resear=
ch in progress and digital project reports.For more information about submitting and to subscribe, go to http://mss.penn=
