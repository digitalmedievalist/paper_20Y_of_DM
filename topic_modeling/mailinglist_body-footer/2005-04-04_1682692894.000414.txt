>To follow this up: on at least one operating system, matters are rather
different.  In Mac OS X, there is a quite wonderful TeX implementation
named XeTeX: go see
http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=xetex.  This
does Utf-8 right out of the box -- CJK, Thai (with hyphenation tables
even!!), Arabic, Mongolian, polytonic greek, just anything as far as I can
see.  It also seems to work nicely with OpenType font families, etc.  It
also works seamlessly with LaTeX, including some real tricksy bits of
LaTeX (long tables, for instance, spanning many pages).  I got this
running from bare ground to making Arabic pdfs in about 30 minutes -- you
have to install the full TeX, XeTeX, and a graphic UI, TeXShop (which
creates pdfs straight out of the TeX, which is very cool), but all this is
nicely explained on the XeTeX site.  I don't yet know whether XeTeX works
ok with the EDMAC critical edition macros, but there's no reason why it
should not.I'd have to say that TeX is still, after all these years, just the best
typesetting system I have seen. I agree with Dan, that it is annoying in
that appartently simple things (changing page sizes!) can be hard to do in
TeX.  But boy, does it make up for it in its power to make really complex,
really beautiful pages.  I am currently setting some 10,000 pages of a
historical edition (about 9,000,000 words) from XML, and for a task like
this, TeX is incomparable.  We use our own transformer tool to translate
the xml into tex source, and away we go (as always, we have to do dicy
things like make up pages from bits of other pages mosaiced together, with
lots of text bounded by empty elements, so XSL does not cut it for us).
all the best
