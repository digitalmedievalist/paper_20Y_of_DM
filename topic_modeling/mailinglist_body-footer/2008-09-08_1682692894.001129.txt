Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHi dm-l'ers,This is just a notice to tell you that the Digital Medievalist website
and wiki will be down this Thursday 11 September for several hours
from 15:00 GMT.  The system will be migrated through several operating
system version changes, and a number of other processes upgraded at
the same time.  The mailing list is independent from this site and
will be in operation through-out and I will post a notice when the
upgrades have been fully completed.  All DM data has been backed up
and the majority of the website is stored in a subversion repository
at a different institution from the website.  This is just warning
that the site will be down that day until all problems have been
resolved and the site reinstated.I apologize for any inconvenience this might cause.Best,-James
