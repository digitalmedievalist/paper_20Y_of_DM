sponsoring two DH-focused sessions at next year's ICMS at Kalamazoo. Please
see the descriptions below, and contact me with any questions that you
might have.Best wishes,
Anna*DH on a Budget: how to develop digital projects with limited resources (a
roundtable)*Sponsored by the Rossell Hope Robbins Library (University of Rochester)Organizer: Anna Siebach-LarsenDigital scholarship has been part of medieval studies for decades, and is
only becoming more so, given the increased digitization of manuscript
collections and the creation of new digital tools, alongside the heightened
emphasis of digital skills in graduate training. Yet the development of
digital scholarship requires resources – money, time, labor – that have
always been limited and are becoming more so. This workshop panel will
discuss on a practical level the kinds of digital scholarship and tools
that can be developed with constrained resources, focusing on projects that
can be built and supported across a range of institutions to meet a variety
of research and pedagogical needs and interests.We encourage the demonstration of digital tools and scholarship alongside a
discussion of their costs (money, labor, time) and requirements, with an
eye toward encouraging replication, innovation, and collaboration. Possible
tools include 3D modeling, RTI scanning, digital editions, imaging, mapping
projects, and more. Presentations might include hands-on demonstrations and
participation, advice for grant applications, and discussions on the
importance of collaboration in all its possible guises. We encourage
acknowledgement and discussion of the constraints of funding models,
precarity, academic and professional hierarchies, student training,
institutional support, replication, and sustainability.Please send proposals to Anna Siebach-Larsen (

*The Present and Future of Digital Editing (a roundtable)*Sponsored by the Rossell Hope Robbins Library (University of Rochester)Organized by: Ashley Conklin and Anna Siebach-LarsenIn 2015, Elena Pierazzo argued that “cultural heritage texts are complex
objects which have reached us inscribed on stratified, diversified and
conflicting documents that require the cultural and dialectical
intermediation of expert readers: the editors. This requirement has not
changed with the advent of the Web: on the contrary, the easier it becomes
to publish on the Web and the larger the quantity of textual materials
available, the more important becomes the guidance of the editor.”[1]
<#_ftn1> Her observations ring particularly true for digital editions of
medieval texts, which often grapple with the material substrate of the
texts themselves alongside the accretions of centuries of editorial
traditions and practices. Yet, as has often been observed, we continue to
grapple with the question of *what* a digital edition should be and *how*
that vision might best be achieved. These questions remain at the forefront
of digital editing on both a conceptual and pragmatic level: should a
digital edition be a digital version of a print edition? what do we want
our digital editions to do? how do different types of digital editions
function in terms of research and the classroom, and how can and should
they speak to each other? what benefits do new platforms such as Manifold
offer for medieval texts and manuscripts? how can we fund the creation and
support of digital editions? how might we best collaborate across projects
and continue to build a community of practice?This roundtable will explore present practices in digital editing and look
to its future. We encourage participation from speakers who are engaged in
editing or publishing digital editions, and/or who have used digital
editions in their own scholarship and teaching. In other words, we hope to
facilitate a discussion about the benefits and challenges associated with
digital editing from the producers and users of digital editions. Some of
the discussion topics may include but are not limited to: the drawbacks and
benefits of various platforms, moving from print to digital (or vice
versa), open-access, crowd-sourcing, pedagogy, encoding methods, the
accessibility and use of metadata, sustainability, invisible labor, the
politics of digital vs print editions, the usefulness of standard
guidelines, interdisciplinary collaboration, and successes and failures.Please send abstracts to Ashley Conklin (aconkli2(a)ur.rochester.edu) and
Anna Siebach-Larsen (annasiebachlarsen(a)rochester.edu) by *September 15,
2019*.------------------------------[1] <#_ftnref1> Elena Pierazzo, *Digital Scholarly Editing: Theories,
