> Digital Medievalist will be holding elections at the end of June 2016 
> for four positions to its Executive Board. Board positions are for two 
> year terms, and incumbents may be re-elected (for a maximum of three 
> terms in a row). Members of the Board are responsible for the overall 
> direction of the organisation and leading the Digital Medievalist’s 
> many projects and programmes. This is a working board, and so it would 
> be expected that you are willing and able to commit time to helping 
> Digital Medievalist undertake some of its activities, like editing the 
> journal, organising conference sessions, administering website, 
> facebook group and news feeds, or maintaining a technical 
> infrastructure - and there is room for any initiative you would like 
> to take to foster the communication on digital methods in medieval 
> studies.
>
> For further information about the Executive and Digital Medievalist
