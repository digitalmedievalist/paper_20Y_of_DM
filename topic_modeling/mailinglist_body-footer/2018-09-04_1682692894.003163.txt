conditioned by their materiality --  that the shape of a charter or a 
manuscript is a part of its meaning. Since the 1980â€™s, recognition of 
this principle has elevated the study of material culture to a field 
within the broader discipline of Medieval Studies.  At the same time 
libraries, research institutions, and museums have been intent on 
producing digital catalogues and images of  their collections.
The result of these initiatives is a mass of data and metadata 
constituting a new frontier for digital methods: 3D modeling, 
multispectral imaging, and Handwritten Text Recognition create new 
modalities of representation, while Controlled vocabularies, Linked 
Data, Ontologies and APIs like IIIF enhance the possibilities to model 
and share descriptive data. Superadded to these developments, digital 
methods for the interpretation of source material and presentation of 
research results have grown beyond the materiality of printed books and 
articles: data publications have started to gain traction in the 
community; complex visualizations tell more than a description by words, 
and digital editions incorporate experimental forms of interaction with 
research data that goes beyond the traditional forms of publication. In 
all of this, Medievalists have been leaders in adopting digital methods 
to work with the physical heritage of the Middle Ages.
Given this ferment, the Digital Medievalist community is looking for 
proposals presenting projects making use of these new technologies to 
give further - and new! - insights into the materiality of sources, and 
how medievalists work with cultural heritage data to understand better 
the impact of the digital methods on our understanding of the Middle Ages.Please send your proposal (300 Words incl. a short CV) to 
dm.imc2019(a)gmail.com by Sept. 25th.--===============3572053830533678561==--
