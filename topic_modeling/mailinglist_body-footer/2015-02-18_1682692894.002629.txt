It was the still in development Mirador 2 in the demonstration.
Eben English has just done a presentation at Code4Lib=20video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DgCfpQgXcpTE&t=3D2h40m16s=20slides at http://slidesha.re/1DiNNucwhich addresses this question. Nowadays it may not even be a competition, as =
it is possible to serve many of the viewers as javascript with the images and=
 leave the end viewer to make their choice.It may also be appropriate to deploy different viewers with different materia=
l types (such as the map viewer at oldmapsonline.org for maps or georeference=
d material) or to try the approach of the Wellcome who have commissioned (and=
 are making generally available) a more universal viewer that can cope with a=
ll the formats (video and audio as well as paper-based) that their spectacula=
r collections contain. From the perspective of those of us dishing out the on=
es and zeros, having a single solution that copes with all formats is obvious=
ly a bonus for reducing our workload and potential future migration issues, b=
ut our consumers may have other priorities. Hopefully IIIF will allow us to r=
each a compromise that keeps us both happy.

Subject: [dm-l] comparisons of different e-MS readers?Yesterday I attended a planning meaning concerning the Durham priory
library's manuscript collection, which is planned for digitisation
over the next 5-10 years.  A question came up about whether there's
been any study done on the relative *technical* merits of different
platforms/programmes for viewing manuscripts, either online or
downloaded locally.  (The person was specifically interested in reviews
or comparisons done by people with the relevant computational know-
how).I confess to not being very familiar with this terrain; I've used
Uni-HD's reader online (see, e.g., the Manesse codex:
http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cpg848/0001?sid=3Dc1e158af8bb04a02441=
c48d73cfba985)
and the reader used by, e.g.,
http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/0000/bsb00001649/images/, but I
don't even know what the programmes behind these sites are!  The one
that was demonstrated to us is Mirador:
http://www.biblissima-condorcet.fr/en/news/interoperable-viewer-prototype-now=
-online-mirador,
http://iiif.io/, and it was really
cool.  I'd love to know how it stacks up against the competition.Cheers,
-Sara
