*Digital technologies and the Herculaneum Papyri*The technology available today could not even be dreamed of over 250 
years ago when the Herculaneum Papyri were first discovered. Although 
technological developments have always been crucial for accessing the 
papyri, the dawn of the digital age and the subsequent innovations in 
technological resources have seen a dramatic increase in our ability to 
read these long-buried texts. Drawing on examples from PHerc. 78, the 
so-called Caecilius Statius, this paper will outline the history of 
technology and the Herculaneum papyri, and how changing resources have, 
and continue to enable, new discoveries among this unique collection.For those who cannot make it to London, the seminar will be 
live-streamed on the Digital Classicist YouTube channel:
