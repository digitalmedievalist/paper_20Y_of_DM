then digital slavist, now digital americanists... any others? Have we
really started a trend?The $10 fee I'm not so keen on, but perhaps it helps keep them in the black.Dot---------- Forwarded message ----------

Subject: Digital Americanists Membership Call
To: SEDIT-L(a)listserv.umd.eduDear Colleagues: We are pleased to announce the formation of a new professional
organization designed to support the scholarship and teaching of
American literature and culture using digital media.  The Digital
Americanists was formally brought to life at this year's American
Literature Association in Boston, and in the past couple of months we
have established the necessary frameworks to begin officially filling
our membership rolls. At our new wiki-based website, http://www.digitalamericanists.org,
you will find the constitution, an initial list of members, an initial
list of associated digital projects, a bibliography of resources, some
sample classroom syllabi and activities,  and information on how to
become a member along with a description of the privileges of
membership. After you've become a member and paid the modest $10 annual fee
(which can be done conveniently online), we invite you to help build
the wiki by adding information about yourself, your digital projects,
your teaching, and whatever else you feel would be of interest to this
community. Please join us in our efforts to create a vibrant organization that
can support this growing field of American literature scholarship. Andrew Jewell, President
 Edward Whitley, Vice-President
 Amanda Gailey, Secretary/Treasurer--
