I'm forwarding this in case it is of interest...ALT is seeking paper submissions for a Special issue of our ALT Journal
(ALT-J).  Details are as follows:LEARNING AND TEACHING IN IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL WORLDS A special issue of
ALT-J, Research in Learning TechnologyImmersive virtual worlds (IVWs), such as Second Life, Active Worlds,
Croquet and Forterra and massive multi-player games (MMPGs), such as
EverQuest and World of Warcraft represent a paradigm shift in learning
technology, and an important challenge to the world of education. The
aim of this special issue of ALT-J is to develop and publish a timely
collection of papers representing current research, developments and
ideas in educational applications of IVWs and MMPGs. Of particular
interest are papers that go beyond descriptions of objects and
activities to build links between practice and pedagogy, and offer
conceptual, methodological and analytical rigour.Full details of how to submit can be found at:
