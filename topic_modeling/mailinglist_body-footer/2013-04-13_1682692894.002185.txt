25-26 April 2013, Krak=C3=B3w (Poland)
One of the numerous objectives of COST Action 1005 "Medioevo Europeo" is the =
development of the Virtual Centre of Medieval Studies (VCMS) which shall inte=
grate hitherto dissipate databases, textual collections, and dictionaries int=
o a mature tool for carrying out research on Middle Ages. This goal, however,=
 can only be achieved with reflection on the existing tools, practices, and u=
sers' needs. These are the crucial questions which we want to address with ou=
r workshop which focuses on the corpus-dictionary interface. The meeting will=
 start with a short presentation of the digital projects that are being carri=
ed out in the Institute of Polish Language in Krak=C3=B3w (Polish Academy of =
Sciences) which hosts the workshop. The first working session (State of Art: =
Good (and Bad) Practices, Formats, APIs, Interfaces) will comprise brief "sta=
te of art" reports dealing with the existing tools of the lexicographical and=
 textual research. It will provide us with a deepened insight into the techni=
cal issues of the prospective tools' integration and will contribute to the d=
escription of good and bad practices of dictionary and corpora linking. Each =
participant will try to describe the databases according to the strict protoc=
ol which includes their chronological and geographical scope, search and brow=
sing capabilities, interface type, file formats, encoding standards, licensin=
g model, and web APIs.The second working session (Corpora Use in Lexicographic Practice) provides r=
eal-world scenarios of the use of corpora-dictionary interface. Practising le=
xicographers will demonstrate how corpora facilitate everyday dictionary writ=
ing processes and how text collections can be exploited in order to enrich th=
e lexicon. The contributions gathered in this section shall help to precise w=
hat are the features of the prospective VCMS that would satisfy the lexicogra=
phers' community, and what are the interlinking models that would match its n=
eeds.The last two sections (Mature Projects: Goals, Tools, Challenges and Emerging=
 Projects: Perspectives and Challenges) of the workshop will group demonstrat=
ions, mock-ups, and practical learning sessions. Creators of mature projects =
and research infrastructures will share their experience in what concerns the=
 syntactic and semantic interoperability of their services. They will also of=
fer other participants a short training. Those, in turn, whose projects are o=
nly in the construction or planning phase, will demonstrate their scientific =
goals, and the problems they encounter in assuring high data linking profile.Local Organizer
