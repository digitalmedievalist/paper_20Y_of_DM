portal.  Below is the text of the public announcement.
NTVMR 2.0 Announcementhttp://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de
The New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room (NTVMR) from the Institute for 
New Testament Text Research (INTF) is a community portal for scholarly 
research of New Testament Greek manuscripts.  For decades, the INTF 
(producers of the Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament) has housed the most 
comprehensive collection of manuscript resources for Greek New Testament 
studies, and now this resource is finally coming online for public 
access.  Over 2.1 million pages have been cataloged with nearly half a 
million images published in cooperation with holding institutes around 
the world, including P45, P46, and P47 from The Chester Beatty Library 
and University of Michigan, The Freer Gospels from the Smithsonian 
Institute, and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus reordered from the Biblioth√®que 
Nationale de France.
This is the first public invitation to join this portal, make use of 
these scholarly resources, and contribute to this public repository of 
New Testament manuscript research.
