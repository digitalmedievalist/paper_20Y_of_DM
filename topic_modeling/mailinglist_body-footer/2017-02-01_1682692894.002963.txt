invites proposals with a focus on the needs of users/readers, for the
summer 2017 season, which will run on Friday afternoons in June and July in
the Institute of Classical Studies, Senate House, London.We welcome proposals in any area of classics, including ancient history,
archaeology and reception, that employ digital or other innovative and
collaborative approaches to the study of the ancient world (including
cultures beyond the Mediterranean). Researchers of all levels, including
students and professional practitioners, are welcome, and we expect a
diverse audience of philologists and historians, information scientists and
digital humanists, graduate students and interested members of the public.There is a budget to assist with travel to London (usually from within the
UK, but we have occasionally been able to assist international presenters
to attend).To submit a paper, please email an abstract of up to 500 words as an
attachment to gabriel.bodard(a)sas.ac.uk by March 19th, 2017.
