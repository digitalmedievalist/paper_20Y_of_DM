covered in his post, except to say that that is also my sense of the 
state of LaTeX right now: support for UTF-8 is still clunky, and 
Unicode/OpenType fonts are not natively supported. To judge from its 
website the promising Omega project seems to have stalled.I'm wondering if you've considered XSL-FO as a way to get from TEI to 
PDF. Apache's FOP (see http://xml.apache.org/fop/) is supposed to be a 
good free implementation. If I recall correctly, earlier versions of FOP 
used TeX or LaTeX to output PDF files, but now it outputs directly to 
PDF. There's a great advantage to staying within XML to do a job like 
producing a PDF: you use an XSLT script to output an FO file, and then 
send that to FOP.There are also commercial products for working with FO (here's one with 
a free academic license: http://www.renderx.com/download/academic.html), 
and some of them sound far easier to use than FOP. Being rather 
perverse, I'd probably stick with FOP myself. I'll bet there's some 
experience getting TEI to FOP on this list.PeterDaniel O'Donnell wrote:> The Digital Medievalist List (see end of message for contact
