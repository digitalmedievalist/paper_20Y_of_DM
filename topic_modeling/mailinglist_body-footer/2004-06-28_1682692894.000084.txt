Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableSpeaking of hacks, here is an example of what I was talking about. It is=20
from the <www.digitalmedievalist.org> website's screen css=20
<http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/dmlscreen.css>.b) Screen Geography
*/div {					/* controls width and location of all blocks except div.navigation =
and children */
		    margin-left: 20%;
		    max-width: 35em;
		    top: 0;
}
div.navigation	{
		margin-left: 0;
		position: absolute;		/* position: absolute is for MSIE only; the style is r=
emoved below */
		top: 15px;
		left: 4px;
		width: 18%;
}/* MSIE workaround */			/* This instruction hides "position:fixed" from MSIE5=
.5~6.0 */
body>div.navigation {
	     position: fixed;
}
This is a harmless enough hack, I suspect (it would be better if the=20
second instruction referred to "body div.navigation" to keep the two=20
instructions exactly parallel). Currently it works; if MSIE later=20
implements the > child rule, then it won't work for MSIE anymore, and=20
users of MSIE will end up with scrolling navigation. I am beginning to=20
wonder if it is not better, however, to design a sheet to the standard,=20
and then allow users of MSIE to choose a simpler sheet if some effect=20
doesn't work well in their browser. Comments?
