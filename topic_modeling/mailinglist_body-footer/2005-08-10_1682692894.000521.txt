Ireland. It can be found in parish churches and cathedrals, houses and
halls, castles and museums throughout these isles. Rarely, however, do we
get to spend time actually looking at this rich part of our heritage in
detail. A new resource of over 10,000 images is now available via AHDS
Visual Arts that lets you do just that.The Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland (CRSBI) is an
electronic archive of British and Irish Romanesque stone sculpture.  It
exists to photograph and record all the surviving sculpture, making this
important part of British and Irish heritage available over the internet.The significance of this evolving project as an authoritative scholarly
resource cannot be understated as significant quantities of previously
unrecorded material have come to light and there are many examples of
sculpture that are being recorded, catalogued and photographed in an
academic context for the first time.Records of Romanesque sculpture in Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Cambridgeshire
(including Ely Cathedral), Cheshire, Hampshire, Huntingdonshire, Kent,
Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Sussex, Warwickshire and Worcestershire are
already available online.CRSBI complements other AHDS Visual Arts architecture and sculpture based
resources including the Exeter Cathedral Keystones & Carvings: A Catalogue
Raisonné of the Sculptures & their Polychromy collection
(http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/collections/ECKC.html) and the Public Monuments and
Sculpture Association collection which contains images and textual
information on over 2,300 public sculptures and monuments in Britain
(http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/collections/PMSA.html).For more information on CRSBI please go to:
