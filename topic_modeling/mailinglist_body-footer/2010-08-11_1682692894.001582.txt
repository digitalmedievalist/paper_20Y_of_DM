analyse and publish gnomologia, collections of sayings. We are looking  
specifically at Greek and Arabic collections. We are interested in  
developing criteria for linking citations within collections, between  
collections, with translations, with >source< texts, and with texts  
which use them. For further details of our project, Sharing Ancient  
Wisdoms, Exploring the tradition of Greek and Arabic wisdom   
literatures (SAWS) see
http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/humanities/depts/bmgs/research-section/saw/I am writing now because I could very much like to establish contact  
with other projects working in similar areas. There are a lot of  
conceptual problems which is would be very helpful to share: so I  
would be very glad to hear from anyone who would like to talk to usWith thanksCharlotte Roueche
