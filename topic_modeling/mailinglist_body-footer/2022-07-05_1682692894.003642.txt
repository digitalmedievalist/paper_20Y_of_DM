A Global Approach to Digital Textual Scholarship9:00 - 19:30, Biblioteca San Francesco della Vigna, Campo San Francesco, Cast=
ello 2786
9:00 -  9:30, Preludium: Introduction to Textual Heritage by Franz Fischer (C=
a' Foscari)9:30 - 11:15, The Sky is the Limit - A global approach to digital textual sch=
olarship: The Coronelli's Celestial Globe.
Session led by Benedetta Bessi (Ca' Foscari), Daniele Fusi (Universit=
y of Bamberg; Ca' Foscari) and Alberto Campagnolo (Universit=C3=A9 Ca=
tholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve)Abstract: The Marciana National Library holds the first set of 3 =C2=BD foot =
celestial and terrestrial printed globes made by Vincenzo Coronelli (1650-171=
8) and bequeathed to the Venetian Republic in 1689. Uncommon textual objects,=
 the globes are a perfect example of the possibilities of a global approach t=
o digital textual scholarship. The celestial globe, printed on laid paper gor=
es - subsequently mounted on plaster over a wooden structure - is of particul=
ar interest as it presents unique features, including numerous manuscript ins=
ertions, that lead to its identification as a prototype.11:30 - 12:45, Leaving Venice - Editing a manuscript of Marco Polo's =
travels.
Session led by Franz Fischer (Ca' Foscari), Paolo Monella (Sapienza U=
niversity of Rome), Holger Hessler (Ca' Foscari), Tiziana Mancinelli =
(Ca' Foscari; ICDP Digital Library), Miriam Vita Errico (Ca' =
Foscari) and Silvia Marsili (Ca' Foscari)Abstract: The session will provide an overview of digital philology methods, =
based on the case study of manuscript Bodleian Library 264, including an illu=
strated copy of the travel report of the Venetian explorer Marco Polo. After =
a presentation of the manuscript, students will discuss which of its features=
 should be included in a digital model. Then an actual digital edition of the=
 manuscript will be shown and discussed. Based on the latter, the instructors=
 will introduce: the basics of TEI XML textual markup; issues related with th=
e intersection of the document material structure and the abstract textual st=
ructure; the TEI Guidelines; the encoding of named entities (people and place=
s).13:00 - 14:30, Lunch break14:30 - 16:00, High Noon at the Library (optional).
Optional visit of the Sala Monumentale of the Marciana Library with the Coron=
elli Globes (accessible via Museo Correr)16:00 - 18:00, The Remains of the Text - Natural Language Processing.
Session led by Federico Boschetti (ILC-CNR; Ca' Foscari), Angelo Mari=
o Del Grosso (ILC-CNR; Ca' Foscari), Agnese Macchiarelli (Ca'=
 Foscari), Federico Tanozzi (Ca' Foscari) and Jessica Puliero (Ca=E2=
=80=99 Foscari)Abstract: The first part is devoted to a linguistic study of Italian, Latin a=
nd Greek astronomical texts both in prose and in verses. Students will learn =
how to perform morphosyntactic analysis by applying computational linguistics=
 methods and instruments. The second part consists of a =E2=80=9Chands-on=E2=
=80=9D session in which students will work on the Musisque Deoque Platform fo=
r the intertextual analysis of Latin poems on astronomy and nature.18:30 - 19:30, Biblioteca San Francesco della Vigna, Campo San Francesco, Cas=

Endangered Cultural Heritage in Venice9.30 - 12:30, Tour of St Mark's Square and Arsenale - Meeting point at St Mar=
k's Square
Public spolia and power - Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry (SfM) of Tetra=
rchi and four Lions at Arsenale:
Guided tour and activity led by Federico Bernardini (Ca' Foscari), El=
isa Corr=C3=B2 (Ca' Foscari), Nevio Danelon (Ca' Foscari), El=
eonora Delpozzo (Ca' Foscari) and Francesca Dolcetti (Ca' Fos=
cari)9.45 - 10.30, St Mark's square
Abstract: Spolia are artefacts dating back to Antiquity and inserted in the u=
rban fabric, as architectural elements and/or decorations. Venice is a remark=
able example of this phenomenon; two places in particular are important to un=
derstand the significance of spolia as symbols of power: St. Mark's s=
quare and the Arsenale. During the morning, the participants will be guided i=
n discovering the =E2=80=9Cstones of Venice=E2=80=9D, nowadays endangered for=
 various reasons.10.30 - 12.30, Arsenale
Abstract: Digital technologies can offer tools and solutions to address the i=
ssue of the endangered CH, in particular through the so-called =E2=80=9Cdigit=
al copies=E2=80=9D. SfM offers the possibility of fast and low-cost acquisiti=
on of 3D spatial data of artefacts, buildings and landscapes, using simple ov=
erlapping pictures. After a short introduction to the basics of SfM, particip=
ants will conduct their own survey of one of the ancient marble Lions in fron=
t of the Arsenale.13:00 - 14:00, Lunch at Hum.Us - Calle Larga S. Marta, 213714:00 - 15:30, Aula (16, 17, 18) 19 - San Sebastiano, Campo San Sebastiano, D=
orsoduro 1686
Digital Technologies - From image acquisition to point cloud and 3D models.
Workshop led by Federico Bernardini (Ca' Foscari), Nevio Danelon (Ca=
' Foscari), and Eleonora Delpozzo (Ca' Foscari)Abstract: During this workshop, participants will learn how to process the im=
ages acquired during the morning using the SfM Agisoft Metashape software, in=
 order to produce 3D models of the spolia.15:45 - 18:00, Aula (16, 17, 18) 19 - San Sebastiano, Campo San Sebastiano, D=
orsoduro 1686
Public engagement and cooperative learning.
Workshop led by Elisa Corr=C3=B2 (Ca' Foscari) and Francesca Dolcetti=
 (Ca' Foscari)Abstract: This workshop will focus on the development of good practices for m=
anagement and promotion of the endangered CH in Venice. Participants will be =
working in groups using either digital models or printed replicas of the spol=
ia to develop four distinct media outcomes, which will be disseminated via th=
e VeDPH communication channels:
- Social media: post /meme for Instagram and Twitter
- 3 minutes double interview targeting broader publics
- 3 minutes TED talk for specialist audiences
- Virtual exhibition with panels using the kunstmatrix software18.30 -  20.30, Sale Docks, Magazzini del Sale, Punta della Dogana, Dorsoduro=

Deprogramming Today's Sociality (OPEN EVENT)
Workshop conducted by the artist and activist Paolo Cirio
Day 4, Thursday 14 July 2022
History on display and in the streets. Discovering the past through public an=
d digital methodologies.9.30 - 13.00, Aula 2, Ca' Dolfin, Calle Larga Ca' Foscari, Do=
rsoduro 3825/D
Making the Renaissance Public: the example of Hidden Cities apps.
Workshop led by Fabrizio Nevola (University of Exeter; Ca' Foscari)Abstract: Drawing from two research projects, Hidden Cities (www.hiddencities=
.eu<http://www.hiddencities.eu>) and Florence4D (www.florence4d.org<http://ww=
w.florence4d.org>), this class considers how digital history methods are crea=
ting new research opportunities, while at the same opening up new ways to eng=
age the wider public. Spatially-determined research questions encourage us to=
 think about how meaning is constructed from the triad of spaces-objects-peop=
le, while spatial technologies (GIS, GPS, 3D modeling) allow us to shape inno=
vative responses to those questions, ranging from interactive map interfaces =
to locative interpretation delivered on handheld devices. In so doing we are =
discovering new things about the material culture of public space in the Rena=
issance, but also making that research directly available to the public.13.30 - 14.30, Lunch at Caffé Diemme - Via Giovanni Pascoli, 11, Venezia=
 (Mestre)14:30 - 18:00, M9 Museum,Via Giovanni Pascoli, 11, interno 9, Venezia (Mestre)14:30 - 16:00, Museums and Public History. From collections to users-oriented=
 Museums.
Lecture by Francesco Frizzera (Museo Storico della Guerra, Rovereto)Abstract: Over recent decades museums have radically transformed, adjusted an=
d re-invented their principles, policies and practices. Traditional museum de=
finition no longer seems to reflect the challenges, manifold visions and resp=
onsibilities of museums facing contemporary societies. Authoritative and gene=
rally accepted definitions of museum do not longer fit the role of museums in=
 terms of public expectancy. Aim of the lesson is to show the potential and l=
imits - conceptual, financial and contextual - of this approach through some =
examples and experiences of the Italian context: among them, some experiences=
 of the mixture of Digital and Public History developed by Italian cultural i=
nstitutions.16:00 - 16:20, Displaying historical violence. The case of Inquisition and to=
rture museums.
Presentation by Anna Clara Basilic=C3=B2 (Ca' Foscari)Abstract: Exhibitions and museums on the Inquisition are usually focused on t=
he trial procedure, which involved torture. This form of violence is typicall=
y exhibited through torture devices in recreated prisons. In Italy, such tren=
d is well represented by torture museums, which tend to exhibit contents rela=
ted to the Inquisition by providing a narrative that reproduces the power sem=
antic of the ruling institution. Through the case study of the Steri Palace i=
n Palermo, I will provide an example of a different curatorial choice, which =
leads the visitors to focus on a different perspective: a form of collective =
knowledge about early modern confinement rooted in the captives' expe=
rience that modifies the positioning of the visitors.16:30 - 18:00, Visit to M9 Museum.
Guided tour led by Stefano Dall'Aglio (Ca' Foscari) and Livio=
 Karrer (M9)Abstract: M9 belongs to a new generation of museums. For the very first time,=
 a museum narrates the compelling history of the 20th century. A century that=
 saw great and small changes: from evolutions in everyday life to momentous s=
ocial, economic, environmental and cultural changes. State-of-the-art technol=
ogies and immersive displays help visitors learn about the past, understand t=
he present and imagine the future.
Day 5, Friday 15 July 2022
From Digital Museography to Contemporary Artistic Practice: Venice, the Bien=
nale and Beyond9:00 - 10:45, Fondazione Querini Stampalia, Santa Maria Formosa, Castello 5252
A new wave of museology.Abstract: The session will focus on the digital strategy implementing the mus=
eum collection's perception for communication and research purposes. The intr=
oduction will open up to the new form of cultural object that has acquired bo=
th a physical and a digital identity thanks to the technological application.9:00 - 9:15, Welcome remarks from a representative of the Fondazione Querini =
Stampalia.
Stefania De Vincentis (Ca' Foscari)
Introduction: The museum as phygital environment.Abstract: The digital strategies adapted to the museum space and the art coll=
ection correspond to a multi-factor reading combining immersion and a new per=
ception of the online art collection. By defining the digitised art object, w=
e can take into account Digital Art Work for NFT platforms and consider it as=
 a =E2=80=9Cphygital=E2=80=9D object, both real and digital. Whether it is a =
replica of the original artifact or a new digital cultural object, it's curre=
ntly under debate.9:15 - 9:30, Identifying ourselves: the social media activities of Palazzo Gr=
imani Museum.
Marco Mazzocco (Museo di Palazzo Grimani - Direzione regionale Musei Veneto)Abstract: What are the strategies to make known a "young" museum which is app=
arently unusual only in the panorama of the cultural offer of the city of Ven=
ice? To build a clear, compelling identity, of course.But the biggest challen=
ge is to get people to recognize it as a living and reactive entity in the te=
rritory in which it's located. Using some examples, we will look at the Museu=
m's social communication before, during and after the pandemic.9:30 - 9:45, Tribuna VR360 at Palazzo Grimani VR360 at  Palazzo Grimani
Luca Vascon and Chiara Masiero Sgrinzatto (Photographers).Abstract: The most important pieces of antiquities of Palazzo Grimani in Veni=
ce were located in the extraordinary room called =E2=80=9CCamerino delle Anti=
chit=C3=A0=E2=80=9D (Chamber of Antiquities), known nowadays as =E2=80=9CTrib=
una=E2=80=9D. Tribuna Grimani VR is an experimental project, whose goal is to=
 show a range of innovative ideas and technologies and new technical tools fo=
r VR shooting. It is made of 2 high-resolution 360 photos at different height=
s  and a panoramic drawing.The characteristics of Tribuna Grimani allow us to=
 show how a conscious use of technology can enhance the perception of a work =
in its space, both in situ and off-site. As a result, it facilitates interpre=
tation and increases the value of personal experience.9:45 - 11:00, Dive into Digital Art collectionAbstract: This session will present current online databases for the search, =
indexation, and sharing of online images. The discussion will focus on digita=
l visualization and comparison methods as well as indexing tools for the digi=
tal humanities, with a focus on database collection building and metadata ins=
ertion for digital images.9:45 - 10:00, Lyon16ci and 1516 projects.
Barbara Tramelli (Ca' Foscari)Abtract: The Lyon16ci and the 1516 are two publicly accessible databases of i=
llustrations printed in the 15th and 16th century, resulting from a collabora=
tion among the Equipex Biblissma, the VeDPh and the VGG in Oxford. They can b=
e searched using an image as a search query as well as using text keywords fo=
r searching metadata assigned to the illustrations. Such a visual and text se=
arch capability allows research scholars to track and investigate the product=
ion, use, circulation and copying of woodblocks, iconographic subjects, artis=
tic styles, within 15th and 16th-century printed illustrated editions. The da=
tabases are publicly accessible and accept contributions of new illustrations=
 and metadata from research scholars from all over the world.10:00, Prometheus art database.
Lisa Dieckmann (University of Cologne; Ca'Foscari)Abstract: Prometheus is a distributed image archive which currently connects =
114 databases from different image based disciplines with 2.8 million images =
in total making these images and the respective metadata available for resear=
ch. The presentation will focus on challenges and perspectives of connecting =
heterogeneous databases, e.g. optimizing image information retrieval, metadat=
a, visualization and other features.11:00, Coffee break11:15 - 13:00, Visit to Museum of Palazzo Grimani - Rugagiuffa, 4858
13:00 - 14:00, Lunch at Food & Art - Campo de la Tana, 2169/f
14:00 - 18:00, Tese of Arsenale - Campo de la Tana, 2169/f14:00 - 16:00, Media Artivism and Public EngagementAbstract: In this session we will approach the origins and development of Act=
ivism in Media Art from an epistemological framework and through the study of=
 a selection of case studies focused on some current trends: invasive technol=
ogies and the ethics of surveillance, eco literacy and sustainable developmen=
t, gender issues, political and social injustices.14:00 - 14:15, Media Artivism & Expanded Information.
Carolina Fern=C3=A1ndez-Castrillo (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Ca=E2=80=
=99Foscari)Abstract: From a Media Archeological methodology, we will understand what is =
Media Artivism and how important is the connection of Artistic Activism with =
Investigative Journalism in the Postdigital Age. We will explore the role of =
data visualization, immersive installations and interactive projects based on=
 the use of new media and the Internet as instruments of awareness and social=
 protest. There will be paid special attention to Contemporary Art practices =
based on hacktivist and intercreative procedures aimed to give visibility to =
uncover realities in traditional media.14:15 - 14:30, Control+Space.
Paolo Berti (Ca' Foscari)Abstract: A particular aesthetic of databases and computing takes shape out o=
f a lineage from conceptual and systems art. One of the most radical practice=
s of this machinic language is "repetition". Repetition has served artists to=
 emulate the machine, to investigate anti-narrative forms but also to play wi=
th the linearity of time-based systems, which in today's technological world =
have found a performative side (using sometimes irony, sometimes an open conf=
rontation) in new media concepts such as surveillance, constant geotracking, =
and a different idea of space.14:30 - 14:45, Serious Games: Artivism and Ecology.
Ana Mej=C3=B3n (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid)Abstract: The growing impact of ecological consciousness in the public sphere=
 has reached different creative industries in the last 15 years. Videogames a=
re no exception. Serious games have addressed some of the most recurring soci=
al concerns. However, the main challenge has been and still is reaching big a=
udiences that usually prefer mainstream video games. This presentation examin=
es the cross-fertilization processes between artivism and the industry of vid=
eo games related ecological awareness.14:45 - 15:00, Horror, Art & Gender: Politics and the Body.
Vicente Ortega (Universidad Carlos III de Madrid)Abstract: The audiovisual essay =E2=80=9CHorror, Art & Gender: Politics and t=
he Body=E2=80=9D explores the relationship between diverse contemporary films=
 and art works, establishing how their representational templates intertwine =
to deliver subversive approaches to the body and subjectivity. It studies the=
 gender politics of this cinematic & art works to scrutinize how they questio=
n some of the building blocks of heteronormativity. Consequently, they point =
to an understanding of how the human body and mind may function beyond the do=
minant dictates of today's social fabric.16:00 - 18:00, Visit to the Biennale-Arsenale18:30 - 20:00, Closing Keynote (OPEN EVENT)
