Just a reminder: you still have a possibility to contribute to this 
survey. We already have more than 40 answers, but we need *yours* to 
improve the picture of the community :)[please ignore this message if you are not involved in digital work with 
manuscripts]Dear colleagues,The Special Interest Group for Manuscript Encoding of the TEI wants to 
draw a picture of the current status, requisites and future demands 
related to the SIG's agenda.For this purpose, we would like you to participate in the study "Trends, 
Concerns and Dreams among the Users of the TEI for Manuscript Material".The first part of this study is an online survey. Its results will be 
presented at the TEI Members Meeting in Zadar, Croatia, November 2010 
and discussed at the next SIG meeting in order to steer future 
developments of the work of the SIG.To participate, you simply need to fill in this anonymous online survey, 
which should take you less than 10 minutes:

possible to draw a faithful picture of the community of users of the TEI 
for manuscript material (inside and beyond the TEI-MS SIG).Thank you very much in advance for your participation, and please feel 
free to circulate this announcement among your colleagues.Malte Rehbein and Marjorie Burghart--
