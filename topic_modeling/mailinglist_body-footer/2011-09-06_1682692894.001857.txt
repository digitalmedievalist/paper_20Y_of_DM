Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitHi Grant (and DM-L)We've been fairly good at getting a strong field of candidates each
year and hope this will continue. It will involve some changes in the
first couple years, I suspect, but by which time those who have served
before could serve again. I don't foresee a dramatic change in this,
but the slate for each year's elections has always been a (pleasant)
surprise.We also wish to increase activities undertaken by the community itself
as volunteers. You know this being one of those wonderful volunteers.
I envision that in my minimum 1-year off, I will certainly be
volunteering some technical expertise with regards to updating the
technical infrastructure behind DM. There might be a sudden lack of
some specific skills but hopefully this is something that the
community can provide.Best,-JamesOn Tue, Sep 6, 2011 at 15:32, Simpson, Grant Leyton

>>We have come up with a suggested process consisting of four major

>>- After these changes, the bylaws will be presented for voting for at
>>least a week and will pass with a two-thirds majority of votes
>>recorded in the voting period.
>>
>>This is the process we are following for the current proposed changes
>>to the bylaws. A majority of the DM Board has already approved them.

>>The old bylaws are at:
>>
>>http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.html
>>
>>The proposed bylaws with substantial additions and deletions marked are
>>at:
>>
>>http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws-new.html
>>
>>We would appreciate any comments on the changes be sent to the DM
>>Board by email at:  board _at-sign_ digitalmedievalist.org by noon GMT
>>on the 19th September 2011. Of course, you are free to discuss this
>>openly here on the the dm-l mailing list as well.
>>
>>In more detail the proposed changes to the current bylaws include:
>>
>>- adding a statement "To undertake other activities relating to its
>>purposes and objectives or the promotion of DM as a community." to the
>>list of our objectives and activities
>>- adding a statement that "Any ties in voting shall be decided by the
>>existing DM Board members excluding any who are standing for
>>re-election." (While this has not yet happened, we thought it best to
>>include some mechanism.)
>>- adding a statement that "No member may be elected to the DM Board
>>for more than three consecutive terms (six years). After three terms,
>>the member must wait one year before becoming qualified for
>>re-election to the DM Board."
>>- replacing a statement saying that "no person may serve continuously
>>as Director for more than 6 years in a row" with one that says "no
>>member may be elected as Director for more than six consecutive terms
>>(six years). After six terms, the member must wait one year before
>>becoming qualified for re-election as Director." So that it uses the
>>same agreed language as with Board members
>>- And the new section on amendments which says:
>>1. Amendments to these bylaws can be composed by the DM Board and
>>become proposed amendments with a simple majority of the total DM
>>Board membership.
>>2. Proposed amendments will be published on the DM mailing list (dm-l)
>>and the DM website with a minimum 10 day period requesting comments by
>>the DM membership.
>>3. The DM Board will discuss comments on the proposed amendments
>>received from the DM membership incorporating changes agreed by a
>>simple majority of the DM Board.
>>4. The agreed version of the amended bylaws will be presented as a
>>whole to the DM membership for voting over a minimum 7 day period. The
>>amended version of the bylaws will pass with a two-thirds majority of
>>votes recorded during the voting period.
>>
>>I look forward to any and all comments on the proposed changes before
