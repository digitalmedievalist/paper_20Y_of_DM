Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) are currently involved in a study
of the impact of digital resources in the Humanities.  We are collecting

feedback will only reach us if you reach the end of the survey and click
'submit'. The statistical results will be publicly reported, but all information
provided by individuals will be anonymized and not tied to any individual.If you would like the results of the survey e-mailed to you, there will be
