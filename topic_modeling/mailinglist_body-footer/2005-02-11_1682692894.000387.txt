	I'm having a weird windows problem I wonder if anybody knows anything 
about: all of a sudden programs that work from the dos prompt at having 
difficulty with long file and folder names. I.e. when I try to write to 
the directory "My Documents" (actually c:\Documents and Settings\Dan\My 
Documents), the files actually get written to a separate directory, 
c:\Documents%20and%20Settings\Dan\My%20Documents which appears along 
side the other in the file tree. The contents of this new directory to 
not map onto the "My Documents" directory. They are separate.
	This problem has arisen in the last week or so, and it is affecting bat 
files that were working fine until recently.
	Here's an example of the syntax I've been using:cd\saxon6_5_3
java -jar saxon.jar -o "c:/documents and settings/dan/my 
documents/_filing cabinet/dm2/3.revised/name/name.htm" "c:/documents and 
settings/dan/my documents/_filing cabinet/dm2/3.revised/name/name.xml" 
"c:/documents and settings/dan/my documents/_filing 
cabinet/dm2/xslt/dm1file2.xsl"
cd\
I've looked for help but not seen anything relevant. Any suggestions?
-dan
