   - Hoyt LongDigital humanities has developed in a range of disciplines and locations
across the globe. Initially emergent from initiatives in textual encoding,
database building, or critiques of design and media cultures, the field is
increasingly drawn together. Present scholarship works at the intersections
of what had been disparate approaches. Much digital humanities scholarship
is driven by an ethical commitment to preserve and broaden access to
cultural materials. The most engaged global DH scholarship values digital
tools that enhance the capacity of scholarly critique to reflect a broad
range of histories, as well as present geographical and cultural positions.
Projects that seek to bring grant resources from the West are often met
with well-developed and challenging critiques emergent around the globe
from communities deeply engaged in their own cultural preservation, as well
as in building relationships with other similarly engaged scholars. This
symposium, which will include an extended workshop and a mixture of
presentation types, engages squarely with issues of power, access, and
equity as they affect scholarship in the digital humanities.Invited speakers and local presenters at this two-day symposium will
address how the interdisciplinary practices of digital humanities can and
should speak to the global cultural record and the contemporary situation
of our planet. Of particular interest is work relevant to or stemming from
challenges in the Global South. The symposium seeks to strengthen networks
of exchange among DH scholars nationally and internationally.Themes and topics of this symposium will include:   - the practice of digital humanities across linguistic, economic, and
   technological divides
   - digital humanities in the light of current geopolitics
   - the environmental impacts of digital humanities research
   - the inflection of local accents in the practices and ethics of digital
   humanitiesFind out more about the symposium at http://msuglobaldh.org/about/Kristen Mapes
