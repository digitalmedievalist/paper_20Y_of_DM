De: AHRC ICT Methods Network <methnet(a)KCL.AC.UK>The Digital Arts & Humanities site was launched on Sunday 11 September 
at a reception at the 'Digital Research in the Arts and Humanities and 
Arts' conference.
Digital Arts & Humanities is a place to share and discuss ideas, promote
your research and discover the digital arts and humanities. This virtual
community of arts and humanities researchers has been developed by the 
AHRC ICT Methods Network in collaboration with several other 
institutions and communities and is hosted by King's College London.
http://www.arts-humanities.net/
As a member of the community you can:- announce activities in your field to a wide audience- keep up to date with what others are doing- exchange ideas and experience with the community in our group forums 
and user blogs- build your profile to show your research interests and background and
search others' profiles to find contacts and identify future collaborations- use our wiki to learn more about tools and methods for your research.
Digital Arts & Humanities is also used as a community platform by 
various groups and projects. We would be happy to host your community 
and offer features including blogs and open or private discussion 
groups. Even if you are already using such features on your own website, 
a presence on Digital Arts & Humanities is a good way of letting the 
wider community know what you are up to and to make new contacts.
Discussions and postings are automatically announced on other websites 
and integrated into social bookmarking and networking sites to make them
available to a wide audience. Our RSS feeds make it easy to add our
community content to your site.
Several other groups support and contribute to Digital Arts & Humanities.
These include: Arts and Humanities Data Service, Arts and Humanities
eScience Support Centre, CHArt - Computers and the History of Art, ICT
Guides. The site already has over 240 registered members and active 
discussions.
You might be especially interested in a forum thread where we discuss 
'After the AHDS: The End of National Support?' This thread continues the 
discussion from a panel at the DRHA conference (David Robey, David 
Sheperd, Lorna Hughes) earlier this month:http://www.arts-humanities.net/366For further information please contact Torsten Reimer
