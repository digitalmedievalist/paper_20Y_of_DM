Dear Medievalists,I have mentioned this elsewhere, but it struck me it should be mentioned
here as well.It is with great pleasure that the Lydgate Society seeks proposals for
20-minute papers and roundtable participants for the 58th Annual
International Congress for Medieval Studies at Western Michigan
University, to take place in person and virtually May 11th-13th, 2023.
If you have work that would fit either of the calls listed below we
encourage you to submit your proposals or contact me at this email
address to seek further information. Full descriptions of the two
sessions can be found on the attached flier or via the Congress website,
and all proposals must be submitted via the Confex system there. The
deadline for submission is September 15th.I have also included a flier in .pdf format should you wish to share
this with your networks or send it along to interested parties.Paper Session, in person: "The Problem of Presentation:
Fifteenth-Century Texts and the Virtual Facsimile."
Roundtable Session, virtual: "The Fifteenth-Century Classroom:
Strategies for Teaching the Divide between Chaucer and Shakespeare."All the best,Matt
