Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitAfter much struggling with BibTeX (which seems unusable to me if you
happen to cite non-English titles or can't use the few standard
bibliographic styles that come with it), I've settled for Bookends. I
agree with you that it's not perfect, but I haven't found better and
I'm pretty sure that you would see a substantial improvement with a
few changes in the bibliographical format(s) that you use (in the menu
bar:  Biblio > Formats Manager > Formatting Options). The codes are
somewhat cryptic and the manual isn't exactly helpful, but I can help
you offlist if you need and are willing to give Bookends a second
chance.LaurentOn Nov 28, 2007 9:42 PM, Peter Baker <psb6m(a)virginia.edu> wrote:
