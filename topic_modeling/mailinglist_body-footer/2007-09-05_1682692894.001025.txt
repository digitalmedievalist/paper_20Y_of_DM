Subject: Online Manuscript Research: e-mail list
Date: 05 Sep 2007 10:20:36 +0100
From: Christopher Burlinson <cmb29(a)cam.ac.uk>Dear all,Following on from the July symposium hosted by Scriptorium: Medieval and
Early Modern Manuscripts Online, we have set up an Online Manuscript
Research e-mail list (hosted by jiscmail.ac.uk). We would like to invite
you to join the list, and encourage you to post to it (and also ask for
your assistance in spreading the word and encouraging your colleagues to do
so!).The list aims to foster collaboration and discussion between the different
professional and academic groups involved in online manuscript research. It
is intended to be a place for announcements (of seminars, conferences, new
online resources, and so on), the dissemination of information of all
kinds, practical questions about manuscripts and about technology, and
discussions about the functions, possibilities, and pitfalls of online
manuscript research. We anticipate it being of use to all the areas which
demand inter-disciplinary and inter-professional work: manuscript
preservation, archival work, project management, digitization, encoding,
rights management, and so on.To join the list, please just send an e-mail to LISTSERV(a)jiscmail.ac.uk
with a blank subject line, and, in the body of the message:SUBSCRIBE manuscripts-online <your name>Your e-mail address will be taken from the e-mail that you send. Further
instructions on how to use the list will be sent to you, by jiscmail, when
you join.We hope that the list will be beneficial to you all, and to our colleagues
in the field, and we beg your patience for any troubles that it experiences
as we get it on its feet.best wishes
