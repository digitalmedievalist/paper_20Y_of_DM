Interedition 9th Bootcamp: 11 - 14 January 2012
------------------------------------------------Interedition invites all interested to participate in the upcoming
Development Bootcamp, which will take place from 11 to 14 January at the
Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.  The bootcamps are intended for the
development of prototypes for interoperable 'microservice' tools for text
scholarship and digital editions.The work of previous bootcamps have focused on collation, transcription,
and annotation of texts; the goal of this bootcamp is to encourage the
development of prototypes for text analysis. One of the most exciting
directions of digital text edition lies in the question of the innovative
lines of research that might be taken when all the textual data is
digitized, annotated, collated, and checked. Examples include:* Discourse analysis
* Linked data
* Stemmatology
* Stylistics
* ...Each of these has been incorporated into one or more existing critical
edition, but there are at present very few tools available that might be
shared between edition projects. There is an acute need for better
interoperability of the tools we have, and for the development of new tools
that are designed from the ground up with the principles of
interoperability in mind.During this bootcamp Interedition seeks to bring together scholars and
developers working on any sort of text analysis for digital edition, to
discuss their lines of approach, the tools they are using, and possible
points of interoperability and interchange of data.  The primary objective,
as with all bootcamps, is the development of prototypes that put the
results of our discussions to work.  Another important objective is to give
developers and early stage researchers an opportunity to meet and share
their own projects and experiences with tool interoperability in textual
scholarship.BURSARIES
COST Action IS0704 'Interedition' is offering bursaries to early stage
researchers (< Ph.D. + 10 years) and developers that want to join the
bootcamp. The bursaries will consist of an =E2=82=AC100 per diem allowance and
will cover full travel expenses, subject to caps. A limited number of
bursaries are available to participants from outside the member countries
of Interedition. [1]HOW TO APPLY
If you are interested in participating in the bootcamp, please send an
email to joris.van.zundert-AT-huygensinstituut.knaw.nl<http://joris.van.zunde=
rt-at-huygensinstituut.knaw.nl/>by
**14 December
2011**. You don't need an intricate motivation, but please state your
affiliation, and add a very short (certainly not more than 200 words)
description of your current or related development work in digital
humanities. Attendance throughout the bootcamp is expected, but in certain
circumstances a shorter attendance may be negotiated.PROGRAM

Interedition (http://www.interedition.eu) is a COST (http://www.cost.eu)
funded Action whose objective is to further the interoperability of tools
in digital scholarship. Interedition is raising the awareness of the
importance of interoperability as a major driver for sustainability for
tools and data in the field of digital scholarship. This activity takes two
forms: firstly, meetings in which researchers in digital scholarship can
network their knowledge of tools and the possibilities for their
interoperability; secondly, the development of proof-of-concept
implementations of interoperable tools. These proof-of-concept tools are
the focus of Interedition's periodic bootcamps, which offer the open source
development community in the humanities opportunities to meet, network, and
exchange knowledge.ABOUT THE ORGANIZERS
The bootcamp and think tank are organized through the kind efforts of:
