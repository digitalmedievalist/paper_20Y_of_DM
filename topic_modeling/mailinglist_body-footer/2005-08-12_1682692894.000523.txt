although there are technical solutions to represent both hierarchies,=20
I've always found it easiest to simply compromise and mark up the=20
structure of one of them as dominant.  (Usually for me this means=20
marking page/folio breaks as milestones.)  This is the milestone=20
method mentioned in chapter 31 of the guidelines.
