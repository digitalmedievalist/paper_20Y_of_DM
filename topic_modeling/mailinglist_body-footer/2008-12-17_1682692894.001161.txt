creative, enthusiastic professionals to develop web-based applications bringi=
ng together materials from existing database-and XML-based resources. You wou=
ld be working closely with colleagues in CCH and in humanities and social sci=
ence departments.CCH is an academic department in the School of Humanities. It is responsible =
for undergraduate and MA programmes and runs a PhD. As part of its very activ=
e research programme, the Centre is involved in a large number of externally =
funded collaborative research projects. These posts are intended to support t=
he technical development of a number of these projects.Details about the posts are provided below:-----------------------------------------[Post 1] TECHNICAL PROJECT OFFICER (Web Application Development). G6/AAV/019/=
08Experience in design and in building environments based on database technolog=
ies is essential. The department uses primarily Java and J2EE technologies to=
 publish database materials on the web, and knowledge of these technologies i=
s also critical. Web interfaces are developed with the use of well establishe=
d JavaScript/AJAX frameworks and in accordance with good XHTML and CSS practi=
ces, and experience with these are highly desirable. Familiarity with XML and=
 XSLT is desirable.Proven experience in creating integrated research applications using a range =
of technologies would be a significant advantage. In addition, a good underst=
anding - and preferably experience - of how research is conducted in the huma=
nities and social sciences will be valuable.For more information about this post, see below:http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/pertra/vacancy/external/pers_detail.php?jobindex=
