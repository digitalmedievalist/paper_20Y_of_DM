already been made by other people, but I cannot pass up the opportunity
to second this, very strongly.  Properly implemented, git can be extremely
user friendly to use (my DMNES project linked in my sig involves a lot
of data entry and requires scrupulous version controlling; my editors have
a web-front end that they use and beyond creating an account on github,
they never interact with git at all), and there is a large amount of
documentation and help out there for those who are willing to put in a
little bit (i.e., an afternoon) of time into learning it.  Learning how
to use git should be considered a requirement of someone who intends to
work in digital humanities, just as learning LaTeX is one for anyone
working in math or logic.-Sara--
