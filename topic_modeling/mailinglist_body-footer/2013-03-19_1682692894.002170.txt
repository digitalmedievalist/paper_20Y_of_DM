Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear all,I am the software architect at the Institut fÃ¼r Neutestamentliche=20
Textforschung.  I've been following this thread with great interest. =20
The question which I believe is essential and still unagreed upon in the=20
community is, "What is a digital edition?"I believe we can all agree on some things-- well, at least one thing=20
which I believe should be at the core of any definition of "digital=20
edition":collection, annotation, preservation and presentation of the raw dataBeyond that, scholars will continue to rightly argue about what a=20
*critical* digital edition actually is.  But my goal as a software=20
architect is to build solid, quality tools for problems I know need to=20
be solved.We've been building now for the past 2 years, in collaboration with=20
Huygens and Tara Andrews mentioned earlier, and the EU Interedition=20
participants, a collaborative community portal software product built=20
on, as Tony suggests, common off the shelf components when they are=20
available-- which all have 'free' editions, and we are building our=20
custom components, specific to our field, to live among and interact=20
with these off the shelf products.We went live with our software about a year ago, with about 150=20
'internal' users.  We've been polishing it up and hope to have a=20
'public' announcement of the tools by the end of April.I believe we've done some good work and I would certainly love for=20
others to take advantage of our tools. Building critical mass for a=20
software system can only improve its features and longevity.If you're at all interested, let me give you some details with some=20
links to try so you know we're not just talk:100% web based
WYSIWYG TEI Editor with Paleography Assistance, Transcription Version=20

those letters)

the shelf portal software with which we integrate.Programmatic Web Services API for external sights to interact with the=20
repository:
http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/community/vmr/api/In short, technically, we've created a suite of digital edition=20
components as Google Gadgets that will run in any Google OpenSocial=20
portal.  We use Liferay inhouse as our portal of choice, as it the most=20
mature portal we could find which supports OpenSocial.  We get so many=20
advantages from off the self software-- more features than our scholars=20
could ask for, which lets us focus on the domain specific tasks for=20
digital editions.Hope this is of interest to some.  Please feel free to contact me if you=20
would like more information.  We're not quite ready to 'shrink wrap'=20
this for easy install, general purpose critical digital edition=20
construction, but we're working toward that.Best wishes,Troy A. Griffitts

>>             some time), which may also be "versions".
>>
>>             - do we really have a problem with the acceptance of
>>             digital editions?
>>                 - first, I take up, what Andrew wrote...
>>                     - "Compared to a printed book, they're miserable
>>             to read, since they tend to be designed first for
>>             technical analysis, and any attention to typography is
>>             typically a very low priority"
>>                         - I'm not sure whether I'd agree on that. I
>>             find most SDEs quite readable. But yes, we're still in
>>             the incunabula age of digital texts. Good digital
>>             typography still has to evolve. Anyway, I'call a lot of
>>             the editions listed in my catalog "readable":
>>             http://digitale-edition.de/
>>                     - "There's no guarantee in many cases that
>>             citations made from digital editions will be stable."
>>                         - but this is a known problem which we
>>             discuss for at least ten years now. And the solutions are
>>             quite clear: PID/PURL-systems, fine granularity of
>>             adressable objects in editions, institutional
>>             committments for the long-term support of SDE, versioning
>>             etc etc
>>                     - "It's far easier to put a good printed edition
>>             together than a good digital edition, especially because
>>             of the lack of standard, user-friendly tools."
>>                         - true, but the underlying problem is that
>>             SDEs are far more complex than tradional edition (as
>>             regards content, methods, technical aspects) - and that's
>>             why generic tools are so hard to build
>>
>>                 - "There is no standard way of presenting online
>>             critical editions (whereas most printed texts are
>>             published in series that follow a style guide)."
>>                         - important point that the community has to
>>             address; but I see these publications series coming up;
>>             just some arbitrary examples:
>>             http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/ -
>>             http://www.sd-editions.com/index.html
>>             <http://www.sd-editions.com/index.html> -
>>             http://www.hab.de/de/home/bibliothek/digitale-bibliothek-wdb/d=
igitale-editionen.html
>>             - http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/
>>
>>                 - "Delving into academic politics, publishers hate
>>             them and many universities don't count digital projects
>>             toward tenure."
>>                         - traditional publishers will not solve the
>>             problems of SDEs
>>                         - academic interest groups are starting to
>>             deal with the problem of credibility of digital work (the
>>             German Historians Union has just set up a working group
>>             on digital scholarship with a subgroup on crediting
>>             digital work in tenure and promotion)
>>                 - second: success on the reader's side can only be
>>             measured in comparison to the success of traditional
>>             printed editions. In comparison to the fact that those
>>             often had an extremly low circulation, were bought nearly
>>             exclusively by libraries ....
>>                 - third: success on the side of the editors. We had 6
>>             summer schools on scholarly digital editing in the last 5
>>             years (http://www.i-d-e.de/events-des-ide). All have been
>>             overbooked. I see fewer and fewer newly starting edition
>>             projects that don't have a digital component or basis.
>>             There is some pressure from the funding bodies, that new
>>             projects and new editions have to be digital. But change
>>             takes some time.
