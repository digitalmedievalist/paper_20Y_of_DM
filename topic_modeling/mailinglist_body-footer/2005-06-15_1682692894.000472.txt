numbers what I have been doing is creating a table in Word and
guess-timating how many lines there are then I just paste the text into
the table and WA LA! I have a table that separates the text into lines.Then I copy the table and place it into Excel and then just leave a column
empty for my line numbers.  Then I type 1, 2, 3 and highlight the text and
put the arrow on the bottom right edge of the cell that I typed 3 in and
pull it all the way down until the end of the text.  You will then have a
text which has line numbers.  If you need the lines to have a certain code
like <L 123> then before you type 1, 2, 3 (above) just format the cell and
click 'custom' and type <L #>, click OK and then you just have to do the
steps above.AbdullahQuoting Laurie Ringer <lringer(a)CAUC.CA>:> I am producing a concordance of the English vernacular texts that
