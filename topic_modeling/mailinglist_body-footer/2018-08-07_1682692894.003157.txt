Registration is now open for =E2=80=98Building sustainable digital pedagogy=
' to be held in Cambridge 27-28 of September.The conference aims to consider the close inter-relationship between teaching=
, scholarship, and research at Cambridge. This special environment naturally =
cultivates a rich variety of digital resources, technologies and tools that a=
re increasingly the result of collaboration.
But does this collaboration extend to the teaching environment to benefit lea=
rners and teachers alike?How can the enthusiasm and inspiration used to build these tools and resource=
s benefit the pursuit of education and learning?What emerging technologies might lead to a focused, efficient, interdisciplin=
ary approach to make a difference to the broadest spectrum of researchers and=
 students?Ubiquitous in the digital age, images have become an essential tool in resear=
ch and pedagogical environments. We've come a long way from the carou=
sel of slides in a projector, and technological change continues to accelerat=
e year on year.But images are only one part of the picture. Hidden in the shadow of high qua=
lity images, there is invaluable work in the creation, management and use of =
data about objects, facilitating new means of discovery and opening the door =
to new methods of analysis.Please see conference webs its for further details.
