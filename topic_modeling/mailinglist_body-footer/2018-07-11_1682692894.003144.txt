Western Michigan University; May 9-12, 2019Sponsored by Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval Cultures <https://www.p=
ress.jhu.edu/journals/digital-philology-journal-medieval-cultures>Organized by Susanna All=C3=A9s-Torrent (University of Miami) and Albert Llor=
et (University of
Massachusetts Amherst)The creation of digital collections of texts, or textual corpora, for researc=
h and preservation may be one of the seminal technological innovations in the=
 digital humanities that still remains at the core of many text-oriented disc=
iplines, including those belonging to medieval studies.When creating a textual corpus, digital humanists face many key choices that =
will determine their project's success. These decisions include the s=
election of standards, format types, methods for text recollection, searchabi=
lity, access, lemmatization, and interoperability, among others.Once a textual corpus is created, quantitative analysis allows researchers to=
 study texts from a variety of critical perspectives and methodologies: stati=
stics, stylometry, authorship atribution and verification, intertextuality, s=
cript recognition, stemmatology, text mining, topic modeling, etc.These analytical methodologies are linked to the study of large amounts of in=
formation, to which one may be tempted to refer to as big data. But what cons=
titutes =E2=80=9Cbig data=E2=80=9D in medieval studies and the digital humani=
ties at large? Does thinking of textual corpora as =E2=80=9Cbig data=E2=80=9D=
 help frame their forms and uses?We invite paper submissions that reflect on the theory, practices, and challe=
nges of creating=E2=80=94 and researching through=E2=80=94textual corpora, in=
cluding but not limited to:=E2=80=A2 protocols and technologies for the creation of textual corpora.
=E2=80=A2 examples of textual corpora.
=E2=80=A2 methologies for the study of textual corpora (e.g., stylometry, ste=
mmatology, script
recognition, etc.).
=E2=80=A2 theory of textual corpora and =E2=80=9Cbig data=E2=80=9D in medieva=
l studies.Please send a 100-word abstract and a Participant Information form to Susanna=
 All=C3=A9s-Torrent and Albert Lloret at lloret(a)umass.edu <mailto:lloret(a)=
