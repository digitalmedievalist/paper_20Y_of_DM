lunch at DH2010:Peter Stokes has reserved a table for us at the Edgar Wallace (a link to
google maps is appended below) at 11:30 am on Wednesday, July 7. I'll be by
the DH registration tables from 11: 15 until 11:25 (the Edgar Wallace is
just around the corner). I'll be the one with the baby.I've already received word from several people who intend to come. If you'd
like to add your name please contact me (dot.porter(a)gmail.com), but if you
find yourself available on the day please feel free to stop by the Edgar
Wallace and look for us. I expect we'll be there for a while.Look forward to seeing some of you then!DotMap showing the location of the Edgar Wallace: <
