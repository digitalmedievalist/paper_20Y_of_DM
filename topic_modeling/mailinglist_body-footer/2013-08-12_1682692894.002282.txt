Medieval & Modern Studies & sponsored by the English Association:CFP #1: 'Millennium: The Year 1014'
This session will feature three papers by speakers focusing on a single
Medieval year, 1014CE. This year in history proves surprisingly fulcral
(Wulfstan's Sermo Lupi ad Anglos in 1014 and the exile of Aethelred; the
crowning of the Holy Roman Emperor; the victories of the Byzantine armies,
for example). Depending on the papers, the focus on this specific year will
illustrate how historical moments can throw our sources, genres, and
disciplinary methods into sharp relief.CFP #2: 'The Manuscript in the Digital Age'
This session will address the profoundly significant issue of the display
of medieval manuscript materials through online repositories and how this
distant viewing affects participants' understanding of what they're seeing.
This session will devote itself to the topic of interpretation: how
repositories and manuscript projects can best set about addressing the gap
between the digital and the 'real'; how tools can be utilised to render all
aspects of the book or document visible to the viewer, through description
or more transparent metadata.The aims of the session will be to highlight
critical methodological and conceptual frameworks and make suggestions for
the best way forward in our brave new digital world.Send abstracts by September 1st to Elaine Treharne, treharne(a)stanford.edu--
