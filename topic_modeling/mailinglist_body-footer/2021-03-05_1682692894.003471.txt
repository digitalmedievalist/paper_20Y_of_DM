YcChLtQRKHkwXLuqexDw>This lecture will investigate the lives of medieval manuscripts and fragments=
 that date from the late sixth century to the fifteenth century, tracing thei=
r survival to the present day, when increasing numbers exist online in digita=
l format. The benefits to scholars of digitization are incalculable, especial=
ly in a time of global pandemic when it is impossible to view manuscripts in =
person. But what do we see when we work with manuscripts and fragments in onl=
ine form only? What are the advantages and what are the challenges of new tec=
hnologies for viewing books produced by hand as new forms of data? This lectu=
re is a call to maximise the opportunities of the digital environment, while =
being aware of the essential skills and expertise required to make the most o=
f access to these incredible resources. Participants can expect a rich and di=
verse range of images and ideas as we look at how manuscripts become data, an=
d data becomes new knowledge.About the speaker: Elaine Treharne, MArAd, PhD, FSA, FRHistS, FEA, FLSW, is t=
he Roberta Bowman Denning Professor of Humanities, Professor of English, and =
Robert K. Packard University Fellow in Undergraduate Education at Stanford Un=
iversity. She is a medieval literature and manuscript specialist, with expert=
ise in the long history of human communication and archival studies. She has =
published over thirty books and sixty articles, mostly focused on Early Engli=
sh texts in their manuscript contexts, and also on the digital aspect of earl=
y textuality. She directs Stanford Text Technologies, which investigates the =
potential of data analysis for the study of historical knowledge production. =
She is interested in the record of human experience: how it is transmitted, w=
ho is remembered, and how the past is memorialised. Her newest books include =
Text Technologies: A History, with Claude Willan (Stanford University Press, =
2019); the Cambridge Companion to British Medieval Manuscripts, ed. with Orie=
tta Da Rold (CUP, 2020); and Perceptions of Medieval Manuscripts: The Phenome=
nal Book (OUP, 2021).More event info<https://events.stanford.edu/events/904/90474/>
