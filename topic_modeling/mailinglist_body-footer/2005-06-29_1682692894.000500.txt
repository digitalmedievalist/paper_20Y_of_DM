this with a anthology of Old English by Conybeare.  The facs. was very

can scan them.  Its up to you really!  Also, I would suggest using
Photoshop for your imaging program, because that's the best available.Abdullah AlgerQuoting Dieter Köhler <d.k(a)philo.de>:> I have been involved in a planning committee to prepare suggestions for t
