of manuscripts "in the field", using their own equipment? I'm thinking
particularly of very remote repositories, that would not have their
own digitization equipment; for a scholar interested in imaging only
one or two manuscripts it might not be reasonable to try to have a
professional set-up (with special book-cradle, special lighting,
etc.). However even in those circumstances it's important to maintain
high quality both in imaging and in metadata. I know for a fact that
there are people doing work like that, hopefully some of them are on
this list. Has anyone actually taken the time to write up best
practices, though?And if not, perhaps we need some.Thanks,
Dot--
