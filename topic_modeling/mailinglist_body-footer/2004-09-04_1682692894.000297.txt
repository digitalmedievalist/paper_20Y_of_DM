    I use Procite (<http://www.procite.com/> to keep my bibliography, 
mostly because it has a good Z39.5 client. Z39.50 
<http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/> is an international standard used by 
many libraries (though not the Royal Dutch Library, duizend 
bliksembommen!)  for data interchange. In the case of procite, what this 
means is that I can download book information, including call numbers 
and subject fields directly from various libraries. Amongst other 
things, it has made it quite easy to rearrange my personal library using 
LoC call numbers (not a perfect system, of course, but since it comes 
ready made, I can't complain).    Anyway, I want now to built an on-line catalogue of my stuff, so I 
can check if I own something when I am in a foreign library. Originally, 
I was just going to dumpt the procite format to a database (it is built 
on a 45 field database) and use PHP and MySQL to built a simple front 
end. But then I began to wonder if perhaps an open source system already 
existed. Does anybody know of one? Basically what I need is a robust 
bibliographic database with a Z39.50 client built in.    -dan--
