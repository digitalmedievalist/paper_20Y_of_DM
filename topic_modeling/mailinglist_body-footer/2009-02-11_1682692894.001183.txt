I have programmed the first version of a tool I call IPA Trainer. It is a
tool supposed to help students learn the IPA characters. I believe and have
experienced that it is very helpful. Any lecturer can register, and then
customise an IPA consonants chart containing only the IPA characters that
are relevant to his/her students and in the order he/she teaches them. A
link can then be distributed to the students, and they can go practice
these characters.I believe you will also find this interesting, and I would be happy if you
would add a link to it on your site. Any feedback/bugs are also very
welcome. The system is in English.The system can be found at:
http://www.ipatrainer.comAn introduction page for lecturers can be found at:
http://www.ipatrainer.com/user/site/index.php?pageID=3Dfor_lecturersA manual can be downloaded from:
http://www.ipatrainer.com/data/pdf/manual_en.pdfI really hope the system can be of use!Rasmus=20Linguistic Field(s): Applied LinguisticsAlso you can take a look at it by visiting=20
