there is a missing elephant in these discussions.  What evidence do we have t=
hat these editions are being used? who is using them?
Rather to my surprise, there seems remarkably little 'hard' data about exactl=
y how many people are using these editions.  So here is an attempt to provide=
 some real statistics on their use.
1.  Web statistics for edition use.
I have statistics dating back to last October (2012) for two substantial 'sch=
olarly digital editions' (to use Patrick Sahle's convenient description) onli=
ne:=20
a. Barbara Bordalejo's Origin of Species Variorum, http://darwin-online.org.u=
k/Variorum/
Over six months, this has had 2995 unique visitors (nearly 500 a month, or ar=
ound 16 a day), paying 3727 visits and looking at 15801 pages.  Maybe most in=
teresting: 280 of those visits accounted for nearly half of all page views, w=
ith 280 visits (about 1.5 a day) being longer than 10 minutes as the reader a=
ppeared to look at page after page.  To put this in perspective: one suspects=
 that more people have looked at this site, and used it intensively, than hav=
e used Peckham's printed Variorum in over fifty years.
b. The database/virtual library of books (mostly) printed in or about Japan b=
efore 1650, at http://laures.cc.sophia.ac.jp/laures/start/
Over six months, this has had 1935 unique visitors (over 300 a month, or arou=
nd 10 a day), paying 3494 visits and looking at 27070 pages.  Maybe most inte=
resting: 441 of those visits accounted for well over half of all page views, =
with 441 visits (over two a day) being longer than 10 minutes as the reader a=
ppeared to look at page after page.=20
2.  Statistics for CD-ROM/DVD/internet sales.
Here are the figures for digital editions, etc, sold by Scholarly Digital Edi=
tions since 2001:PublicationDateCopies sold (approx)Hengwrt Chaucer Digital Facsimile25/10/2000320Bayeux Tapestry Digital Edition31/10/20022500Hengwrt Chaucer Standard Edition3/11/200380Caxton's Canterbury Tales8/10/2003150Miller's Tale5/5/2004110Parliament Rolls of Medieval England5/5/2005560Nun's Priest's Tale3/5/200670Monarchia3/5/200660Leiden Armenian Lexical Textbase (internet)21/2/200836Canterbury Tales Digital Catalogue10/5/201016Commedia1/12/201016
(This will appear in an article in the next few months).  In addition to thes=
e figures:
61 internet access licences have been sold to institutions for the Parliament=
 Rolls, and some 10 individual online licences.
Some points emerge from this.  First, these figures very strongly support Dot=
 Porter's observation, that digital editions of historical materials have ach=
ieved far more use than of literary materials.  Our runaway bestsellers, the =
Parliament Rolls and Bayeux Tapestry, have done far better than our literary =
materials.  The exception appears to be the Hengwrt Chaucer -- but that is, w=
e suspect, used much more to teach about manuscripts than to teach Chaucer.  =
The very few copies sold of the Commedia is sobering: this is probably our ou=
tstanding publication, in terms of sheer scholarly weight, and yet has sold v=
ery few copies. =20Overall: the figures suggest that for literary works, there is much more eage=
rness on the part of editors to make scholarly editions in digital form than =
there is of readers, to read them.  However, the success of our historical pu=
blications (and of the online publications noticed above) shows that without =
doubt, there is no reluctance to use digital materials online, or in CD-ROM/D=
VD-ROM, per se.  The problem with lack of enthusiasm for digital editions of =
literary works is not, we have to conclude, because they are digital.well, make what you will of this

 this would not fit well to the common notion of an "edition" as some form of=
 publication. I think, a SDE must comprise both: the data and some form of pu=
blication of that data. What constitutes a particular edition is the definiti=
on of its subject together with a personal or institutional creatorship (or r=
esponsibility). Edition of X by Y. The edition may then have different forms =
of presentation (online, print, eBook, relaunched online version after some t=
ime), which may also be "versions".

>> - do we really have a problem with the acceptance of digital editions?
>>     - first, I take up, what Andrew wrote...
>>         - "Compared to a printed book, they're miserable to read, since th=
ey tend to be designed first for technical analysis, and any attention to typ=
ography is typically a very low priority"
>>             - I'm not sure whether I'd agree on that. I find most SDEs qui=
te readable. But yes, we're still in the incunabula age of digital texts. Goo=
d digital typography still has to evolve. Anyway, I'call a lot of the edition=
s listed in my catalog "readable": http://digitale-edition.de/
>>         - "There's no guarantee in many cases that citations made from dig=
ital editions will be stable."
>>             - but this is a known problem which we discuss for at least te=
n years now. And the solutions are quite clear: PID/PURL-systems, fine granul=
arity of adressable objects in editions, institutional committments for the l=
ong-term support of SDE, versioning etc etc
>>         - "It's far easier to put a good printed edition together than a g=
ood digital edition, especially because of the lack of standard, user-friendl=
y tools."
>>             - true, but the underlying problem is that SDEs are far more c=
omplex than tradional edition (as regards content, methods, technical aspects=
) - and that's why generic tools are so hard to build
>>         - "There is no standard way of presenting online critical editions=
 (whereas most printed texts are published in series that follow a style guid=
e)."
>>             - important point that the community has to address; but I see=
 these publications series coming up; just some arbitrary examples:  http://e=
lec.enc.sorbonne.fr/ - http://www.sd-editions.com/index.html - http://www.hab=
.de/de/home/bibliothek/digitale-bibliothek-wdb/digitale-editionen.html - http=
://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/
>>         - "Delving into academic politics, publishers hate them and many u=
niversities don't count digital projects toward tenure."
>>             - traditional publishers will not solve the problems of SDEs
>>             - academic interest groups are starting to deal with the probl=
em of credibility of digital work (the German Historians Union has just set u=
p a working group on digital scholarship with a subgroup on crediting digital=
 work in tenure and promotion)
>>     - second: success on the reader's side can only be measured in compari=
son to the success of traditional printed editions. In comparison to the fact=
 that those often had an extremly low circulation, were bought nearly exclusi=
vely by libraries ....
>>     - third: success on the side of the editors. We had 6 summer schools o=
n scholarly digital editing in the last 5 years (http://www.i-d-e.de/events-d=
es-ide). All have been overbooked. I see fewer and fewer newly starting editi=
on projects that don't have a digital component or basis. There is some press=
ure from the funding bodies, that new projects and new editions have to be di=
gital. But change takes some time.
