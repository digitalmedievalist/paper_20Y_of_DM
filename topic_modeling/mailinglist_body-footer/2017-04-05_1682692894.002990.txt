and Sicily, inaugurating a new era of invasion, interaction and integration
in the Mediterranean. Whether or not we decide the millennial anniversary
is significant, the moment offers an ideal opportunity to explore the story
in the south, about a thousand years ago. To what extent did the Normans
establish a cross-cultural empire? What can we learn by comparing the
impact of the Norman presence in different parts of Europe? What insights
are discoverable in comparing local histories of Italy and Sicily with
broader historical ideas about transformation, empire and exchange? The
conference draws together established, early-career and post-graduate
scholars for a joint investigation of the Normans in the South, to explore
together the many meetings of cultural, political and religious ideas in
the Mediterranean in the central Middle Ages.The three-day conference features 80 speakers from around the world, and
three parallel strands of sessions: ‘Conquest and Culture’, ‘Art and
Architecture’ and ‘Power and Politics’.*Secure your place: register by 31 May 2017 at*http://www.oxforduniversitystores.co.uk/conferences-events/history-
