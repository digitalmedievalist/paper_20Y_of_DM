Caroline Mac=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD.Profile
The candidate has a PhD or a Master degree (with research experience) in a fi=
eld of study related to computer sciences applied to the humanities. The cand=
idate should be able to design a database, apply statistical tools, and draw =
mathematical models. Some experience in digital philology would be an advanta=
ge, but at least an interest in textual scholarship is required.Description of the work
The first step in the research process will consist in creating a data base w=
here data coming from different manuscript traditions in different languages =
will be gathered and structured.
The data will be analysed according to the following questions: what types of=
 variations occur, can these types be divided into sub=EF=BF=BD\types, do all=
 these variations occur in all types of texts / manuscripts, are some variant=
s reversible and others irreversible, are there indisputable (objective) crit=
eria to distinguish between "original" (or primary) readings and "derived" (o=
r secondary) readings, etc.Applications (CV + motivation letter) and inquiries can be sent to Caroline.M=
