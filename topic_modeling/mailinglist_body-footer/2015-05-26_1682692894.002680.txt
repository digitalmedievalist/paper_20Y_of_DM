CALL FOR PAPERS
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DDChanges 2015 is the third edition of the International Workshop on=20
(Document) Changes: Modeling, Detection, Storage and Visualization in=20
conjunction with the 15th ACM SIGWEB International Symposium on Document=20
Engineering. This year, the workshop will be held in Lausanne=20
(Switzerland) in September 2015.The focus of the workshop is the study of changes in all its aspects and=20
applications: algorithms to detect changes, models to describe=20
differences, techniques to track changes, versioning of human-readable=20
as well as computer-oriented files, tools to detect meaningful changes=20
among a myriad of modifications.We want to look at these topics from different perspectives, and take on=20
different approaches. The workshop brings together researchers and=20
practitioners from industry and academia. It is a unique occasion to=20
discuss these issues in an informal setting and to foster collaboration.The previous editions emphasised a strong need for novel algorithms and=20
interfaces to better understand and exploit detected changes. Several=20
issues were pointed out as still unsolved: interfaces do not scale when=20
dealing with many changes, changes at different levels of abstraction=20
are often not sufficiently taken into account, detection and=20
visualization are often inter-mixed, logs are often detailed but=20
underexploited, and versioning techniques are not very well suited for=20
non-technical people.Besides contributions on these topics, we also seek contributions on,=20
but not necessarily limited to:	* Diffing and change tracking algorithms
		* Change modeling and representation
		* High-level differences
		* Detecting changes on complex data structures
		* Detecting changes on trees, graphs, diagrams and any kind of document
		* Novel approaches to tree-based diff
		* Edit-distance measures
		* Quality of deltas and patches
		* Editing patterns
		* Semantic diff
	* Merging
		* Management of update conflicts
		* N-way merge algorithms
		* Propagation of changes
		* Versioning systems
	* Versioning
	* Collaborative editing
		* Real-time collaborative editing
		* Distributed collaboration
	* Use in digital humanities
		* Collation
		* Text genetics
		* Stemmatology
		* Plagiarism detection
	* Applications of diff techniques from and to other domains
		* Software engineering, law, medicine etc.
	* Document and schema refactoringContributions from related areas are also well accepted.
Program
--------The workshop will run a full day, divided in two parts to emphasize both=20
theoretical/algorithmic aspects and practical applications. Ample space=20
will be given to peer discussions and brainstorming about the results of=20
the presentations and the ideas brought forth by participants.A detailed schedule will be announced in August.
Proceedings
-----------We plan to publish our proceedings via ACM ICPS, as we did last year.=20
Further details on the publication venue for the proceedings will be=20
available soon.
