A trio of additional notes on Joscelyn (the world's only uncompromising secre=
tary hand font!):First, I've noticed, on Twitter and elsewhere, that a number of people are us=
ing Joscelyn in MS Word without turning on OpenType features. How can you tel=
l? If you see the sigma-shaped s
[cid:812bfc39-a173-4e91-b3cd-d1038f9f7bc4]
anywhere but at the ends of words, OpenType is not turned on, and what you ar=
e typing is not authentic secretary hand. There are easy-to-follow (and illus=
trated) instructions on this matter in the document accompanying the font. Th=
is is only an issue with Word: all other major apps (browsers, LibreOffice, I=
nDesign) have basic OpenType features on by default.Second, development continues (since, cooped up at home, I have so much time =
on my hands), including new glyphs and new rules, especially enabling the use=
 of combining diacritics without breaking cursive connections, allowing such =
insane (but attested!) assemblies as
[cid:5af4614f-ddcc-4783-8105-f28ac6e7ff3a]
for "nonnumquam." Current version is 1.006. So if you are thinking of using J=
oscelyn with any level of seriousness (e.g. for teaching), I suggest looking =
in every now and then at https://github.com/psb1558/Joscelyn-font/releases to=
 grab the latest version.Third, I've put up a specimen page at https://psb1558.github.io/Joscelyn-font=
/. It's unspeakably crude right now, but it does allow you to play around by =
typing your own text in a box, and I will improve it as time permits.Stay safe, everyone.PeterProfessor and Director of Graduate Admissions

Subject: A new secretary hand fontWith the usual apologies for cross-posting:Many of you know that in addition to my day job, I have a weird hobby of maki=
ng fonts for medievalists. This one is a little bit later than the Middle Age=
s, but may still be of interest.I have just released a font called "Joscelyn," which I call "an uncompromisin=
g secretary hand font" because, unlike any other secretary hand font I have s=
een, it makes no concessions to modernity. It is based on the main hand of Co=
rpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 488, John Joscelyn's Historiola Collegii =
Corporis Christi. The hand (not Joscelyn's own) is rather formal, and so less=
 difficult than many secretary hands, but it is as near as I've been able to =
come so far to an authentic reproduction of the hand.When I teach paleography, the most difficult bit for my students is always th=
e last--secretary hand. The idea behind this font is that a decent way to lea=
rn this difficult hand might be to (1) install the font, (2) start a Microsof=
t Word file by double-clicking an included template, (3) apply the "Joscelyn"=
 character style, (4) type whatever you like, and (5) just observe. The authe=
nticity of the font depends on seveal OpenType features being enabled, but th=
e template turns them on for you.At the risk of sounding immodest, I have to say that it's fun to type in this=
 font and see the OpenType features applied in real time--s changed into long=
 s, initial and final forms applied, and much more. And in addition, you can =
pass as much time as you like playing with the font without running the small=
est risk of contracting COVID-19!The font is free (licensed under the Open Font License). You can get it here:https://github.com/psb1558/Joscelyn-font/releasesStay well, everyone.Peter BakerProfessor and Director of Graduate Admissions
