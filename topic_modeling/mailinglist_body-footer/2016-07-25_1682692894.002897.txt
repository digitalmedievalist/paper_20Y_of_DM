h the Transcribe Bentham <http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/> initiat=
ive at University College London (UCL), is hosting a one-day conference on 10=
 October 2016 to showcase how innovative technology is being applied to the h=
umanities and natural sciences.  The "Digital Toolbox" conference will demons=
trate how researchers, curators and enthusiasts can use digital tools to expl=
ore historical and scientific material in new ways.An example is the EU-funded READ<http://read.transkribus.eu/> project, which =
seeks to unlock complex handwritten material in archival collections, to auto=
matically index digital images of text, and to teach computers how to transcr=
ibe handwritten text. Cutting-edge transcription technology developed as part=
 of the READ project will be demonstrated and discussed.The conference will be a platform to share ideas on the best means of exploit=
ing complex research data and opening it up to a wider audience. We are delig=
hted to welcome Melissa Terras, Professor of Digital Humanities at UCL as key=
note speaker.More details on the full programme will be available soon.There will be a small registration fee of =C2=A315 for the event.  This will =
cover tea/coffee, lunch and a wine reception.  Please find the registration f=
