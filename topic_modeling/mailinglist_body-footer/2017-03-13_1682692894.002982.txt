l=20
publication in three languages devoted to historiographical studies and=20
theory of history. With the backing of worldwide specialists and=20
professors from various universities, Historiografias was created in=20
2010 as the brainchild of the research group assembled by Professor=20
Gonzalo Pasamar at the University of Zaragoza (Spain), where its server=20
is located: http://www.unizar.es/historiografias.           As indicated in its Editorial Manifesto (see=20
http://www.unizar.es/historiografias), Historiograf=C3=ADas regards the study=
=20
of historical writings as a field without boundaries, ranging across=20
such disparate viewpoints as cultural and intellectual history,=20
political history and biography, as well as epistemology and social=20
theory, anthropology, sociology and history of science. Hence, the=20
objective of the journal is twofold: 1) to examine all the forms the=20
writing of history has adopted, without any geographical, chronological=20
or cultural restrictions, from historiography in Antiquity to forms=20
memories have adopted in other civilizations, including medieval and=20
Renaissance writers, and modern ways of writing history all over the=20
world, as well as current trends; 2) to give importance to historical=20
epistemology and theory in general.Historiograf=C3=ADas calls for original papers to be included under its three=
=20

oriogr=C3=A1fica=E2=80=9D; and 3)=20

section is devoted to a single issue). =E2=80=9CCr=C3=ADtica=E2=80=9D contain=
