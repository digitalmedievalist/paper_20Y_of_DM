I'm not sure if you will have heard about the work we have been undertaking p=
rimarily at the John Rylands Library (University of Manchester, UK) Special C=
ollections in digitising some of our English Manuscripts. We have almost comp=
leted full cataloguing of over 50 full manuscripts, which are freely availabl=
e online here. The LUNA collections provide a fantastic open source teaching =
and research archive of thousands of images.As well as the collections, we have a number of projects running, involving d=
igitisation of medieval material. You can find links to blog about these proj=
ects on our main blog here.We are currently in the middle of a pilot project to set up a Centre of Digit=
al Excellence, specialising in digitisation of heritage material. The blog ab=
ove will tell you everything about the project.=20
I apologise if this is old news to you! If you would like any further informa=
