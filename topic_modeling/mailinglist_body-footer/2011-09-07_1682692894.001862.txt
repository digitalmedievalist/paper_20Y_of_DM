Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Colleagues:I know it is very late in the game for this kind of posting, but
circumstances are such that I am looking for a post-doc research fellow for
the T-PEN project for immediate hire.  At this point, residence in St Louis
is negotiable (although the successful candidate must already be able to
work legally in the USA).  Feel free to share the details with everyone and
anyone.Jim__________________________Saint Louis University, a Jesuit Catholic institution dedicated to
education, research, healthcare and service, seeks applications for a
full-time, limited contract, Research Fellow (Senior Research Assistant) in
the Center for Digital Theology. The successful candidate will join a
research team which is developing a web-based application in digital
humanities: T-PEN (Transcription for Paleographical and Editorial Notation)
is a web-based tool that assist scholars who wish to transcribe from
digitized, unpublished manuscripts. T-PEN has been in development for a
year, and the new Research Fellow will contribute to its completion over the
next year. Details of the project may be found at
digital-editor.blogspot.com<http://www.slu.edu/jobs/digital-editor.blogspot.c=
om>Reporting to the Principal Investigator, the Research Fellow works alongside
a Java Developer and GUI Developer as well as the project's other Co-PI,
Professor Abigail Firey (University of Kentucky). The Research Fellow
contributes to T-PEN's general development (which features to create or
modify, how to make the application more usable, etc.), participates in bug
reporting and usability testing, attends weekly staff meetings, and executes
a transcription project that will act as a major use case for T-PEN. That
project will be based on one or more the 2,600 manuscripts that T-PEN
currently has permission to use, which are drawn from five partnering
digital repositories (Parker on the Web, e-codices, CEEC, Hougthon Library
[Harvard] and Assisi). The Research Fellow will publish a working digital
edition of the text based on the transcription work using T-PEN throughout
the academic year. The Research Fellow also contributes posts to T-PEN's
blog and must be willing to "tweet" about the project on a regular basis on
Twitter.The successful candidate will possess a doctorate in medieval studies (or a
single humanities discipline with a medieval research focus) and will have
strong, demonstrated skills in paleography and Latin and/or a medieval
vernacular language. Some experience in text editing would also be an asset.
The successful candidate must have demonstrable experience in the digital
humanities (such as digital text editing, software development, digital
image analysis, database development, etc.). Experience with XML encoding
would also be an asset. (S)he must also possess strong interpersonal skills,
be able to work in a team environment, and be able to work to set deadlines.
The position will begin immediately upon hire and will terminate on 30 April
2011. The annual salary will be $40,000, paid on a monthly basis. The
position includes medical and other minor benefits.Summary of Qualifications
