Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear Dominique,This does indeed look very interesting. I have a couple of=20
questions.First, is the software (or some part of it) used to extract the text=20
from the manuscripts going to be released under a free software=20
license? While I'm sure there's plenty of domain-specific stuff=20
there, I'm also sure it could be very useful to other projects which=20
are doing similar things.I find it so frustrating when large publically funded projects=20
funnel their money into proprietary software that can't be further=20
developed and built upon by others. c.f. Transkribus. Here's hoping=20
you're planning to release the code soon!Second question, is there a way to access the plain text directly,=20
or is there only a search interface at the moment? Having direct=20
plain text access can be useful for others to do various further=20
analysis on the corpus.Anyway, great work, looks exciting, congratulations!Nick WhiteOn Tue, Jun 20, 2017 at 03:12:12PM +0200, Dominique Stutzmann wrote:
