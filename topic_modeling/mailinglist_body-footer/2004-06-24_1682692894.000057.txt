Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHi there,IE is certainly well behind Mozilla in implementing CSS, but its XSL parser 
is better than Mozilla's (by which I mean it's significantly faster, and 
appears to implement the standard at least as well). Doing client-side XSL 
transformations of large documents, you notice the difference in the wait 
time on Mozilla. However, Moz has been closing the gap with its last two 
versions, and when Mozilla's SVG implementation finally makes it into the 
standard build, it'll be a giant-killer. XML + XSLT -> XHTML + JavaScript + 
CSS +  SVG is a killer combination for creating cool documents and GUIs. 
Not to mention the fact that Moz does MathML as well.Opera and Safari lack XSLT engines, which is a shame, and only Moz seems to 
have serious intentions about SVG.My 2 cents,
