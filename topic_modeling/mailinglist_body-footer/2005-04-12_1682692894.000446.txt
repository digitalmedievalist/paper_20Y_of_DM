I've just reorganised the Wiki entry for the 2005 conference so that it 
is arranged by date, time, and session title rather than organising 
body. I've also added speaker information.Here's the link--which if you have a web-usable PDA you might want to 
consider bookmarking for use at the conference itself: 
<http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Kalamazoo_2005>.If you know of any additional papers and/or sessions, perhaps you would 
consider adding them to this list?There is one change to note: Advanced Technology in Medieval Scholarship 
(U.Kentucky) (Session 263) has changed time and location: it is now on 
Friday at 10:00 am in Schneider 1265 (Schneider is next door to Fetzer).At some point it might be valuable to collect abstracts to these speaker 
listings. If you are a speaker and have an abstract that you are willing 
to post, one method of doing so might be to create a new entry for your 
paper and post the abstract there, adding a link to the listing for your 
paper in the Kalamazoo 2005 entry. I'll help anybody who needs it, so 
don't be afraid!The Spring 2006 issue will concentrate (though not exclusively) on 
papers presented at the Summer 2005 conferences. If you are giving a 
paper at Kalamazoo or Leeds this year, you might want to consider 
submitting it next Winter for refereeing.We are waiting for the final proof corrections before the Spring issue 
of DM is made public. So you should know what you are getting into 
pretty soon.-dan
