using. Last time I needed such software I used BibTeX, despite certain 
significant lacks. Now BibLaTeX looks very good. But with my last 
venture my publisher got kinda cranky about getting files in LaTeX, so 
I'm hesitant to go that route again.I've been using the Mellel word processor because of its nice 
typography, sensibly structured files and pleasant interface. I got 
Bookends to go with it for bibliographical management, but I find it 
shockingly bad--introducing stray commas in bib entries and doing crazy 
stuff like rendering authors' names as "Smith, John" but editors' names 
(when there is no author) as "John Smith." Unless I just haven't figured 
out how to use it, I think it quite unusable.So: what are the tech-savvy people on this list doing about 
bibliographical management? As medievalists we need software that 
handles edited books (with or without authors' names) gracefully, can 
handle translations, and can help with the complicated bibliographical 
situations we sometimes face in series like CCSL. It would be nice if it 
could produce a two-part bibliography ("primary works"/"secondary 
works"). For my own purposes, it would be nice if it ran on both the Mac 
and Linux, but I'd settle for Mac-only software if it would just work 
properly.Peter Baker--===============7006280146016741326==--
