t is, what it can do, how to document it and how to present it to users. This=
 would probably be part of the project management primer (or section of prime=
r) suggested by Kathryn Powell. [Metadata is "data about data": a library cat=
alog record, descriptive and technical information about electronic files, de=
scriptions of image processing, etc.]For the past year I've been putting together a metadata framework for the Ele=
ctronic Boethius project (using METS, the Metadata Encoding and Transmission =
Standard <http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/>), and recently presented my fin=
dings at the Joint International Conference of the Association for Literary a=
nd Linguistic Computing and the Association for Computers and the Humanities,=
 so metadata is in the forefront of my mind at the moment!Dot Porter***************************************
