year and are planning to go next year...
Once more this year, DM is organizing a series of sessions at the  
Kalamazoo medieval congress.  This years sessions are:
446 -- Text and Image in Digital Materials, Schneider 1360, 1.30  
Saturday: a chance particularly to see the wonderful work being done  
in Marburg on digitization of medieval charters.  I'll also show some  
work we have been doing on Codex Sinaiticus.
499 -- Long term preservation of Digital Medieval Resources, Schneider  
1360, 3.30 Saturday: a panel discussion with various eminent persons  
addressing what happens with digital materials once we have finished  
making them
583 -- The future of electronic editions of medieval materials,  
Schneider 1125, 10.30 Sunday.  What it says!
In addition, Dot Porter is involved in the workshops on digitization  
of primary materials for medievalists (sessions 298, 351).Following the success of these sessions over the last years, we have  
already started planning the Kalamazoo sessions for DM for 2009.  We  
(the board, or at least some of the board) thought of three possible  
topics for sessions for next year:
1.  What every digital medievalist should know (with apologies to Jim  
Marchand): a panel
2.  Exemplary research applications using digital methods (papers)
3.  Digital materials in the medieval classroom (papers -- note the  
slightly ambiguous use of the term medieval here)We are very open to suggestions as to further topics/changes in  
these.  We are particularly keen on sessions which will bring in  
people outside the usual central DM small circle -- it is excellent  
that this year, most of the presentations in DM sessions are from  
people who have not taken part in DM sessions at Kalamazoo before.  By  
May 16 we have to present our list of proposed sessions to the  
conference organizers so if you have any ideas, approach myself or  
anyone else from the DM board at Kalamazoo.All the best
