Place: co-located with LREC 2022, Marseille, France
  *   Date: 25 June 2022 (post-conference workshop)DESCRIPTIONLT4HALA 2022 is a one-day workshop that seeks to bring together scholars who =
are developing and/or are using Language Technologies (LTs) for historically =
attested languages, so to foster cross-fertilization between the Computationa=
l Linguistics community and the areas in the Humanities dealing with historic=
al linguistic data, e.g. historians, philologists, linguists, archaeologists =
and literary scholars. LT4HALA 2022 follows LT4HALA 2020 that was organized i=
n the context of LREC 2020 (proceedings: https://aclanthology.org/volumes/202=
0.lt4hala-1/). Despite the current availability of large collections of digit=
ized texts written in historical languages, such interdisciplinary collaborat=
ion is still hampered by the limited availability of annotated linguistic res=
ources for most of the historical languages. Creating such resources is a cha=
llenge and an obligation for LTs, both to support historical linguistic resea=
rch with the most updated technologies and to preserve those precious linguis=
tic data that survived from past times.
Relevant topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:  *   handling spelling variation;  *
detection and correction of OCR errors;
  *
creation and annotation of digital resources;
  *
deciphering;
  *
morphological/syntactic/semantic analysis of textual data;
  *
adaptation of tools to address diachronic/diatopic/diastratic variation in te=
xts;
  *
teaching ancient languages with NLP tools;
  *
NLP-driven theoretical studies in historical linguistics;
  *   evaluation of NLP tools.SUBMISSIONS
For the workshop, we invite papers of different types such as experimental pa=
pers, reproduction papers, resource papers, position papers, survey papers. B=
oth long and short papers describing original and unpublished work are welcom=
e. Long papers should deal with substantial completed research and/or report =
on the development of new methodologies. They may consist of up to 8 pages of=
 content plus 2 pages of references. Short papers are instead appropriate for=
 reporting on works in progress or for describing a singular tool or project.=
 They may consist of up to 4 pages of content plus 2 pages of references.
We encourage the authors of papers reporting experimental results to make the=
ir results reproducible and the entire process of analysis replicable, by mak=
ing the data and the tools they used available. The form of the presentation =
may be oral or poster, whereas in the proceedings there is no difference betw=
een the accepted papers. The submission is NOT anonymous. The LREC official f=
ormat is requested. Each paper will be reviewed but three independent reviewe=
rs.
As for EvaLatin and EvaHan, participants will be required to submit a technic=
al report for each task (with all the related sub-tasks) they took part in. T=
echnical reports will be included in the proceedings as short papers: the max=
imum length is 4 pages (excluding references) and they should follow the LREC=
 official format. Reports will receive a light review (we will check for the =
correctness of the format, the exactness of results and ranking, and overall =
exposition). All participants will have the possibility to present their resu=
lts at the workshop: we will allocate an oral session and a poster session fu=
lly devoted to the shared tasks in the afternoon.

ission procedure of LREC (introduced in 2010 and adopted by other conferences=
). To continue the efforts initiated at LREC 2014 about =E2=80=9CSharing LRs=
=E2=80=9D (data, tools, web-services, etc.), authors will have the possibilit=
y,  when submitting a paper, to upload LRs in a special LREC repository.  Thi=
s effort of sharing LRs, linked to the LRE Map for their description, may bec=
ome a new =E2=80=9Cregular=E2=80=9D feature for conferences in our field, thu=
s contributing to creating a common repository where everyone can deposit and=
 share data.  *   As scientific work requires accurate citations of referenced work so as=
 to allow the community to understand the whole context and also replicate th=
e experiments conducted by other researchers, LREC 2022 endorses the need to =
uniquely Identify LRs through the use of the International Standard Language =
