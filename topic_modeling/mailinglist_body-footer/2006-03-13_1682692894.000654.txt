description resources at http://www.tei-c.org.uk/wiki/index.php/SIG:MSS. I
hope its pages can still serve as a useful springboard for other work. To
my knowledge, the UC Berkeley side of DS should *not* be considered active
at present, though I would love to see it enlivened again. There seems to
be a shortage of staff and momentum.I, too, would be interested to see the TEI-MS SIG in motion. Surely
there's others on this listserv who wear more than one hat; at MTP we
currently encode edited texts from WordPerfect files with reference to MS
surrogates or typescripts, not directly from MS (surrogate), but I suspect
our methods will be changing a bit as we prepare for a site launch this
fall and continue adding content subsequently.(Btw, for anyone who's wondered when the _Census of Petrarch MSS in the
U.S._ will be posted to Digital Scriptorium--advertised for over a year
now--its markup is on hold for a few more months till someone can finish
her dissertation. ahem. But it's 90+% complete.)Cheers,
Sharon--
