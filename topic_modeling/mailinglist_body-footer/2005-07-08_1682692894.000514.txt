Digital Medievalist
Abstract Submission Deadline: 1 September, 2005The Digital Medievalist project invites abstracts to be submitted
for 20 minute papers to be delivered in either of two sessions at
the thirteenth International Medieval Congress which will take place
in Leeds, UK, from 10-13 July 2006.Session Abstracts:Digital Medievalist General Session: Electronic SurrogatesThe general session investigates any use of digital technology in
Medieval Studies, but especially concentrates on the formulation of
best practice in digital resource creation, particularly the
problems and possibilities of electronic 'surrogates' (e.g. electronic
representations of primary material, including but not limited to
editions, facsimiles, databases) in researching the Middle Ages.
Digital Medievalist Specific Session: Text vs DataThe specific session focuses on the nature of textual data in electronic
editions. Are there fundamental differences between primary source text
when it is seen as text and when it is seen as data (e.g. in a textual
database)? What are the benefits and drawbacks of one over the other?
How do the differences affect our research with electronic media?To submit proposals for either of these sessions please fill out the
online form available at http://purl.org/cummings/DM-Leeds2006.html
before 1 September, 2005.--James Cummings
