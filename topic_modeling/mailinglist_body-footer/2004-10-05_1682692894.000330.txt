Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitHello all,
	I've just tried summarising today's discussion in a wiki entry. I'd be 
interested in what people think of this as an approach to capturing 
collective knowledge. Obviously we wouldn't have the time to summarise 
every thread, and all this information is available in the mailing list 
archive. But sometimes if one has had particular help from the list, it 
might be useful to try writing up an entry.	This model is also good because it is bad (well, not perfect). I 
haven't gone through and got character and glyph right; I don't know 
what the UTF-8 encoding of U+00E6 actually looks like; there are 
certainly more resources or better ways of saying things. Fortunately 
one expects these things to change over time. I would be interested in 
knowing if people have suggesting for indicating confidence in an entry 
(i.e. the author's confidence). Does one indicate in the discussion tab 
that it is a first draft or point out errors, uncertainties one knows exist?	If we had a standard system, people could every so often troll through 
looking for things they know how to correct.-danP.S. Somebody at work was asking me how we enforce spelling standards on 
a wiki, given how weird I spell (i.e. all that uber-canadian -ise 
stuff). I told him one doesn't unless it really bugs one, and then one 
does it oneself.Dieter Köhler wrote:
