Dear Digital Medievalist MembersIt has come the time for me to leave the Executive Board (having finished my =
third and last possible biannual term). For the last five years, after a firs=
t year as vice-director, I have tried my best to fill the big shoes of my pre=
decessors as Board Director.I have seen the community grow and become ever more engaged, both in the Dist=
List and through social media, and, last year, I've introduced the st=
udent and early-career sub-committee<https://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com=
/2019/11/25/introducing-dms-student-and-early-career-sub-committee/> as a mea=
ns to foster collaboration with and involve in DM a number of talented schola=
rs at the beginning of their careers, with all their energy and stimulating i=
deas.I now leave the Direction of DM in the very capable hands of Lynn Ransom. Lyn=
n is Curator of Programs at the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscripts Studies =
at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries and, since 2008, she has directed=
 the Schoenberg Database for Manuscripts. Lynn joined DM in 2016 and has been=
 an invaluable member of the Executive Board since the very beginning.This year, we also say goodbye to a number of longstanding members of the Boa=
rd: Franz Fischer, who will carry on his role as Editor-in-Chief of the Digit=
al Medievalist Journal<https://journal.digitalmedievalist.org/>, Mike Kestemo=
nt, and Georg Vogeler.It has been an exciting six-years, and I am looking forward to all the good w=
ork that the new board, under Lynn's direction, will undoubtedly do.Farewell to you all and good luck to Lynn and the new board.Alberto Campagnolo
