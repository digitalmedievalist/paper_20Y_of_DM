1 February 20182019 Annual Meeting Call for PapersThe 94th Annual Meeting of the Medieval Academy of America will take place in=
 Philadelphia on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, from 7-9 March=
 2019. The meeting is jointly hosted by the Medieval Academy of America, Bryn=
 Mawr College, Delaware Valley Medieval Association, Haverford College, St. J=
oseph's University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Villanova University.The Global Turn in Medieval Studies: Medievalists across various disciplines =
are taking a more geographically and methodologically global approach to the =
study of the Middle Ages. While the Organizing Committee invites proposals fo=
r papers on all topics and in all disciplines and periods of medieval studies=
, this year's conference spotlights the "global turn" in medieval studies. To=
 this end, we encourage session and paper proposals that treat the Middle Age=
s as a broad historical and cultural phenomenon, encompassing the full extent=
 of Europe as well as the Middle East, southern and eastern Asia, Africa, and=
 beyond.  We also invite proposals that explore departures from traditional t=
eleological discourses rooted in national interests, ones that apply discipli=
nary and interdisciplinary methods to study a broad array of subjects.The full call for papers is available here<http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=3D0013=
