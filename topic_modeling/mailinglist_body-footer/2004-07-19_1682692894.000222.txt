While I agree with both Barbara and Abdullah, that commercially-created=20
facsimiles, books (electronic or not), and the multitude of digital=20
research tools are all viable commerical products that we shouldn't=20
expect to receive for free.  My only reservation with this line of=20
thinking is when it comes to publicly-funded projects. It seems=20
to me that all of these open-archive/open journals/etc. initiatives=20
are attempting to address the problem of research that is publicly=20
funded, but then needs to have even more public money spent to=20
read the results of it.  Of course, publishers have an equal right=20
to make money off of the value they add to the process (printing,=20
dissemination, peer review, corrections, etc.).  However, as Barbara=20
pointed out, open journals (etc.) are not the same kind of product. =20An interesting question isn't whether the commerical products should=20
be free, they shouldn't, but whether the output of a publicly-funded=20
research project should be?  It seems ridiculous to me that taxpayers=20
money is spent funding research in field X, and that university
library budgets are stretched to the limit attempting to purchase=20
the journals in which it is published.  You pay for something to be=20
done, and then pay even more to see the results.  But what about when=20
this is not published in a journal, but produces an electronic=20
resource of some sort?In the United Kingdom, any project which creates a significant digital=20
output that is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Board or=20
now British Academy is *required* to deposit a copy of the data with=20
the Arts and Humanities Data Service.  (Those receiving Leverhulme=20
funding are only suggested to do so...)  This is done under a
non-exclusive license that doesn't prevent the depositor doing=20
other things with it (including commerical publication).
(I have, of course, a vested interest in this since the Oxford=20
Text Archive hosts the UK's Arts and Humanities Data Service's=20
centre for Literature, Languages and Linguistics, let me know if=20
you (whether UK or not) have any electronic texts you want to=20
deposit! ;-)   )-JamesOn Mon, 19 Jul 2004, Abdullah Alger wrote:> Digital Medievalist Journal (Inaugural Issue Fall 2004). Call for papers: h=
