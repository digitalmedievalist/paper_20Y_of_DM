Syriaca.org<http://syriaca.org/> is pleased to announce publication of The Sy=
riac Gazetteer<http://syriaca.org/geo/>(http://syriaca.org/geo/), an online g=
eographical dictionary to document Syriac culture in the Middle East, Asia, a=
nd around the globe. The Syriac Gazetteer<http://syriaca.org/geo/> is a born-=

lect of Aramaic, Syriac was widely used during much of the first millenium of=
 the common era. Syriac speaking communities could be found in what today wou=
ld be Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, India, Central Asia, China, and Mon=
golia. Sources in Syriac hold immense value for increasing our historical und=
erstanding of the Mediterranean, the Middle East and Asia. In particular, Syr=
iac sources document key moments in the development and interaction of Judais=
m, Christianity, Islam, and other religions of Late Antiquity.What is The Syriac Gazetteer?The Syriac Gazetteer<http://syriaca.org/geo/> is the first in a suite of refe=
rence works to be published as a part of Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Po=
rtal<http://syriaca.org/>. The gazetteer contains multilingual entries (in En=
glish, Syriac, and Arabic) covering over 2400 places relevant to Syriac Studi=
es, from ancient centers of Syriac culture (such as the city of Edessa<http:/=
/syriaca.org/place/78>) to modern diaspora communities (such as the monastery=
 of Mor Awgen<http://syriaca.org/place/680> in Switzerland). The  Syriac Gaze=
tteer<http://syriaca.org/geo/> is an ever-expanding resource created by and f=
or users based on the principles of Linked Open Data. This publication is int=
ended to serve a broad scholarly audience including students of Middle Easter=
n studies, classics, medieval history, religious studies, biblical studies, a=
nd linguistics as well as Syriac heritage communities and the interested gene=
ral public.
