en Heritage will be held in conjunction with the 7th IEEE International Congr=
ess on Information Science and Technology (IEEE CiSt'23) the week of December=
 16th =E2=80=93 22th 2023 in Agadir - Essaouira, Morocco.Written cultural heritage is constituted by an immense and constantly growing=
 number of texts conveyed by books, manuscripts, documents, and any supportin=
g medium. They are a means of communication and transmission of knowledge and=
 traditions, cultures and beliefs, literature and law, across space and time.=
 Written cultural heritage gives witness to the evolution of humanity, scienc=
es, and arts. It is considered as guardian of speech and language.Preservation, accessibility and exploration of written heritage are core task=
s of heritage institutions such as archives, libraries and museums as well as=
 of universities and other academic bodies. Digital technologies provide new =
and more comprehensive approaches for safeguarding texts and historical docum=
ents as well as for enabling meaningful engagement with our written heritage =
not only by expert curators but also by citizen scientists and the general pu=
blic.More recent enhancements of digisiation technologies and computational tools =
allow for considerable advances in classification, archiving, analysis and in=
terpretation of documents. However, the transformation of the textual heritag=
e into digital assets gives rise to many concerns and challenges. The digitiz=
ation process of handwritten texts, prints and historical documents represent=
s a paramount task. The loss of information issue from acquisition of an orig=
inal object is but one of many problems to handle.The digital turn not only presents technological challenges. Methodological a=
nd theoretical implications question traditional ways of perceiving and defin=
ing texts and textuality, including the mechanisms and means of textual trans=
mission. Digitally transformed ecosystems of knowledge are based on the digit=
al representations of texts and text bearing objects, with the potential of a=
llowing a more efficient preservation and, potentially, a more accurate compr=
ehension of their history and tradition which may help to better understand t=
he present and plan for the future.The conference aims to serve as a valuable venue for researchers and practiti=
oners to exchange their insights, experiences, and best practices.
The conference will focus on various aspects related to the preservation stra=
tegies and workflows, digital content management and automatic processing sys=
tems as well as infrastructures, frameworks and tools used for preserving and=
 making accessible written heritage.TOPICSWe solicit submissions of original ideas and papers describing significant re=
sults and developments in the digital curation of written cultural heritage f=
ocussing but not restricted to the following topics:
  *   Digitisation workflows, tools and infrastructures
  *   Heritagization criteria and practices
  *   Born digital textual heritage
  *   Page segmentation, layout analysis and classification
  *   Image/video preprocessing (incl. multiview geometry, 3D computer vision=
) and analysis
  *   Handwritten text recognition (HTR), optical character recognition (OCR)=
 and manual transcription
  *   Digital representation of texts: standards and formats
  *   Annotation, indexing and search
  *   Textual authenticity, fidelity and reliability
  *   Licenses and legal issues
  *   Knowledge representation: accumulation, integration, management
  *   Accessibility, usability and impact of digital resources
