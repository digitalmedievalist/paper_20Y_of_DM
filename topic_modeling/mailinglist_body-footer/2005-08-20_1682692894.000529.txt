(I'm even on the CCCC Committee on Computers in Composition and
Communication), I would say yes, all humanities graduate students need an
introduction to humanities computing, and I've long been thinking that
the conceptual approach you suggest is a good way to start.  As we all know, digital tools are both changing the way we do work in
the humanities and they are creating new methods, theories, practices, and
opportunities. I'd argue, actually I have been increasingly arguing both
locally and in other forums, that to ignore the issue of humanities
computing and the increasing role of digital technologies and digital
culture in graduate education is quickly shifting from being an issue of
not being on the cutting edge to being an issue of negligence on the part
of that program. In other words, it's rapidly becoming not an issue of
humanities computing and the disciplinary subject, but humanities
computing becoming one of the various methods and practices of engaging
the disciplinary subject.  But I'd go farther too (this is the technorhetorician and the Ongian in
me). It shouldn't just be about digitizing material, but also the
production and consumption of native digital texts, and understanding of
digital culture, digital noetics and practices, and the logic of new
media. In other words, not just how to digitize primary sources, but how
digital technologies can change the way we do scholarship.  But I'd go farther too (this is the technorhetorician and the Ongian in

digital technologies can change the way we do scholarship.  For instance, how can the logic of new media -- the cut-up, the mix and
remix, juxtaposition, association and linkage, to name a few -- change the
ways we can make arguments, explore our subjects, and share and preserve
information? In what ways might the mediated experience of a virtual
recreation of an archeological dig change the way archeology is done (for
one, would the added financial and physical constraints of creating a
real-time virtual reality model of the dig outweigh or be outweighed by
the possibility of future archeologists (or the original archeologists)
reexploring a dig in much the same way architects create virtual reality
models to "walk" through? Or how does our understandings of digital
culture help us rethink our understanding of past cultural processes a la
orality and literacy studies and book history? Or, for that matter, how
can our understanding of earlier cultural processes help us understand
digital ones (see, for instance, John Miles Foley's Pathways Project, or
the work being done in textual and bibliographic studies).JohnJohn Walter | walterj(a)slu.edu
