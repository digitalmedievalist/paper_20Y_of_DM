it's well usable in the most popular browser (which too bad still is
IE). If it's not, users will blame the application, not the browser. So
I wouldn't recommend not making your application IE compatible. One
should do both: implement the standards and provide a IE compatible
version as well. >>even if IE is parsing XSL better right now, other browsers,

just parse server side and sending HTML? For those who want the very
XML, a download button, FTP, or OAI solution may be provided. HTML is
implemented fairly reliable over all browsers, is it? Or do I fail to
see an important point for not parsing XML server side?
