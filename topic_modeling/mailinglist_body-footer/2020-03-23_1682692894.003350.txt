and upcoming events.The seminar by Daniele Fusi, "Presenting Cadmus: a general-purpose and
modular content editing alternative for complex models" (see abstract
below) will be held online Wednesday 25 of March at 17:00 on Google
Meet. If you are interested in participating, please send and email to
vedph(a)unive.it.The VeDPH seminars will continue in April and May. The next seminars
will be:

Analysing and Reading Elizabethan and modern poets with SPARSAR";
8 April 2020 at 17:00, Sara Tonelli, "Building tools and datasets to
detect online hate speech: current studies on cyberbullying and
islamophobia".In the meantime you can see videos of past VeDPH seminars on our youtube

editing alternative for complex models"In the traditional content creation process of Scholarly Digital
Editions, a "text-centric" perspective is often responsible of the
persistence of a "book paradigm" in its digital reincarnation. At least
when producing content, we essentially deal with a text which flows from
paper to a digital document with annotations (XML), to be then published
to HTML via XSLT. Here, the tree structure laid on the text bears the
whole data universe. This is consistent with the typical usages of TEI,
essentially oriented to the "reconstruction of documents".
Yet, in some cases, especially with the outgrow of data provided by new
types of analysis (e.g. morphological, syntactical or metrical tagging),
and/or when handling very complex documents (e.g. inscriptions or
complex literary traditions), this may not be the most efficient
paradigm for creating content.
In such scenarios, a paradigm shift might be beneficial. Here, TEI might
be the final outcome of a more articulated production flow, rather than
its starting point. Thinking textual, meta-textual or non-textual
content beyond the technological and mental markup constraints allows
freeing scholars from a number of practical issues (e.g. apparatus and
workarounds like stand-off), letting them focus on their logical rather
than physical models. Also, when creating content we should emphasize
the typical requirements of any modern content editing infrastructure
(e.g. centralization, robustness, real-time validation and search,
web-based concurrent editing, etc.), which are very difficult to be met
when dealing with text files. For these scenarios, I'm proposing a
simple, modular and open editing solution, codenamed Cadmus.
