Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThis is the first new release of Junicode, the font for medievalists 
(and others), since 1977.This release contains fixes of several bugs, improved coverage of the 
Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (MUFI) character set (though this is 
not yet complete). Most of the medievalist Unicode characters recently 
added in Latin Extended D and other ranges have been added. Many of 
these were already in the Private Use Area; the PUA characters remain 
for now, but users should begin to adopt the new, more standard 
encodings. The regular face currently contains 5870 glyphs; the italic, 
bold and bold italic faces are much less complete, though an effort is 
being made to make the italic face match the regular where appropriate.The design of several glyphs has been revised; those who prefer the old 
design should turn on "Style Set 9" in an OpenType-aware application.On the technical side, OpenType support has been improved and extended. 
TrueType instructions have been supplied for all glyphs: these are a mix 
of "auto-hints" added by FontForge and instructions written by hand.There are still feature requests that I have not gotten to yet; I'll 
work on these for the next release.Junicode is a SourceForge project: get it at 
http://junicode.sourceforge.net/. By request, the current version has 
also been uploaded to CTAN; I'm not sure how soon it will be available 
for download there.Best wishes to all,
Peter Baker--===============7303733456983138842==--
