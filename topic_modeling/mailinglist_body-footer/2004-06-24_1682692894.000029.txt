Subject: Re: [dm-l] What would people like to see in a primer and/or 
series of primers?Okay, I'll venture a response to Dan's question...I think any primer  should include some advice regarding IT project 
management. Managing a research project involving the creation of 
digital resources can be a quite different experience from managing a 
more traditional research project, and a lot of people go into it for 
the first time blind to what's involved. Such a guide might include 
advice about what you need to know before putting in a grant bid, how 
to think about time and budget, how to storyboard a website or 
database, and keeping academic and IT resources in dialogue. I 
certainly wish we'd had such advice when we began work on our database 
project here at Manchester -- it might have saved us some time that 
could be put towards further academic research.And thanks to Dan for creating this list -- I think it has the 
potential to be a really useful resource.Cheers,
Kathryn
