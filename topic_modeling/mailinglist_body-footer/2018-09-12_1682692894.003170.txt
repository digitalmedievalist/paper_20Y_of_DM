humanities infrastructure and cultural heritage modelling at the 
Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities (HELDIG).Core people of the DH Lab at UCLA (Annelie Rugg and Anthony Caldwell) 
will share their experiences. The idea is that this is a good chance to 
develop our thoughts about DH infrastructure, teaching and research at 
the University of Helsinki and beyond. The workshop is well suited for 
memory organisations as well. Please remember to sign up in time because 
the places at the workshop are limited.For more information, see:
