users switch from IE 5. that is, they *appear* to be going from IE5 not 
to IE6 but to mozilla.all this said, i would still guess people on this list will have a 
higher percentage of IE5 and non-IE browsers with your users, in part 
because you probably have a larger mac audience than the general 
population. you probably also have more users with the lower 
resolution. these are obviously just guesses, though.cheers,
