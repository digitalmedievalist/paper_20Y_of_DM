Owing to the limited time to decide this, I've gone ahead and blacked
out the digital medievalist website (stealing the page from the ACH
who have got it from elsewhere). Usually I wouldn't take such
unilateral action without discussing it with the DM Board first, but
it was either a question of doing it or not.Usually I'm against non-political organizations like DM participating
in such actions, but I agree that the initially proposed legislation
would potentially be detrimental to DM's mission. I hope that our
participation in this doesn't cause too many problems for others.I'll restore the website early tomorrow.James Cummings,
Director of Digital Medievalist
