EXPERT MEETING on Digital Scholarly EditionsThe working group on Digital Scholarly Editions of the European Research Netw=
ork NeDiMAH (Network for Digital Methods in the Arts and Humanities, http://w=
ww.nedimah.eu) is organising an Experts' Seminar on Wednesday, 21 Nov=
ember 2012 at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands in The=
 Hague. The seminar is being held in conjunction with the 9th conference of t=
he European Society for Textual Scholarship, =E2=80=98Editing Fundamentals: H=
istorical and Literary Paradigms in Source Editing', 22-24 November 2=
012 in Amsterdam (http://www.textualscholarship.eu/conference-2012.html).The NeDiMAH working group on Digital Scholarly Editions seeks to promote the =
use of existing digital technologies in the production of scholarly editions,=
 bringing together experts from a wide variety of disciplines and time-period=
s to establish the state of the art and recommend a set of best practices in =
order to ensure maximum interoperability and long-term preservation of, and a=
ccess to, digital data.
In particular, the topics which will be addressed at the seminar are:
=E2=80=A2 Theory: What is a digital edition? What is its purpose, and who are=
 the intended users? What, in short, is the nature of the digital editorial e=
ndeavour?
=E2=80=A2 Production: What are the various stages in the production of a digi=
tal edition? Standards for digital imaging and basic text encoding are now fa=
irly well established, but there remain several fundamental issues yet to be =
resolved, such as how one can best deal with documenting and representing tex=
tual variation and the basic question of editing the text as opposed to editi=
ng the document (i.e. the text in situ). To what extent are collaborative/dis=
tributed editions the way forward?Proposals of not more than 500 words are invited by the 10th of September (to=
 mjd(a)hum.ku.dk or elena.pierazzo(a)kcl.ac.uk). Please note that for this se=
minar we are particularly interested in methodological and theoretical contri=
butions, rather than project reports. Speakers will be allotted 15 minutes fo=
r their presentations followed by 10 minutes of discussion. The seminar will =
close with a general round-table discussion.We are able to reimburse, up to a certain amount, people coming from one of t=
he NeDiMAH contributing countries; please let us known if you want to be cons=
idered for this.Matthew Driscoll and Elena Pierazzo
2. WORKSHOP Using Large-Scale Text Collections for ResearchThe NeDiMAH working group Using Large-Scale Text Collections for Research als=
o hosts a workshop on Wednesday 21 November 2012 and also at the Huygens Inst=
itute for the History of the Netherlands, in The Hague, The Netherlands/The workshop Using Large-Scale Text Collections for Research: Status and Need=
s will be used to inventorize the availability of text corpora for researcher=
s from different disciplines in the participating countries and languages. Ho=
w large are the available corpora? For what purposes were they created? What =
kinds of mark-up do they contain? And which tools are available to help minin=
g the corpora? What is missing in both texts and tools to make the corpus als=
o useful for other research disciplines than the one it was originally create=
d for? The first part of the day-long workshop will be used for an introducto=
ry paper by the group leader, followed by short papers of the participants sk=
etching the situation in their country and language(s) and the needs of their=
 own specific research discipline. The rest of the day will be dedicated to d=
iscussions about the topics addressed during the first parts: what are the sh=
ared positive points in the different countries/languages/disciplines? Is the=
re an overlap in the different needs that were expressed? What can we learn f=
rom each other? Where can we push the developments further through a shared a=
pproach?Abstracts are invited before 10 September and can be sent to karina.van.dalen=
(a)huygens.knaw.nlDetails about the abstract and about reimbursement possibilities can be found=
