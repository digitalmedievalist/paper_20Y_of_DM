membership of the DM Board.  It was a very closely fought election
this time, with a plethora of well-qualified candidates.  A total of
53 of you voted and for a long time there were only a few votes in it.
 But eventually the top four (in alphabetic-by-surname-order) were
found to be:Daniel O'Donnell, Malte Rehbein,  Torseten Schassan, and Peter Stokes.
 All of them welcome (or welcome back) to the DM Board.I would like to thank: George Ferzoco, Franz Fischer, Michael Norton,
and Rebecca Welzenbach for being willing to run as well.  Everyone
received a really good showing of votes, so I would in no way be
disheartened!  The Board is always looking for help especially in
reviewing, copy-editing, and editing journal articles.The results of the optional poll on the ballot form was also
interesting, and I may summarise the results at some point back to the
DM-L list when I've had more time to digest them.Thank you especially to all of you who voted!Best,James Cummings and Roberto Rosselli Del Turco
