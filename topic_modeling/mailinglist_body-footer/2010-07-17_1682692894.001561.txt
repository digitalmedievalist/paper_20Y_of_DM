enable the comparisons between the editions see
http://blogs.oucs.ox.ac.uk/jamesc/2009/09/04/tei-comparator/), though
I'm not involved the website itself. (Which for the record doesn't
involve the TEI-Comparator software, only its output which provides
the links between the two texts.) The versions of the texts which are
available were primarily completed to enable those working on the
handbook a greater ease in moving between corresponding paragraphs in
the different editions.  The texts available themselves shouldn't be
viewed as flawless scholarly editions, more of a tool for this
secondary research.  The latest contact I had with the project
involves the intention to provide further scholarly notes on
corresponding portions of a section of the electronic texts, perhaps
by next year. I believe the secondary handbook is well under way and
is being edited.  As I'm only tangentially involved with the project
it isn't my place to comment on their funding and future plans, and I
certainly don't know any of the details of their arrangements with
OUP, but rest assured that last I heard the project is working hard.
I believe the contact person may be away for awhile, if the enquiry is
urgent I could put you in touch with other members of the project.-James
