School of Advanced Study (SAS) on sharing digital text editing training and
teaching methods. The workshop takes place on *May 14, 2015* and is
organised and endorsed by NeDiMAH, DARIAH-RS, Erasmus +, and the DiXiT
Network.Over the past decades, those active in developing a range of digital
scholarly editing practices have built up a large body of knowledge about
digital tools and methods that enable the development, presentation, and
analysis of digital texts. This has resulted in a wide variety of methods
for teaching and training of text editing. However, those who have to adapt
quickly to working in a digital scholarly editing environment are often not
aware of these different training methods. As a consequence, they might be
overlooking available resources, or even re-inventing the wheel.The event will bring together teachers of digital editing with a group of
people who have faced the need to learn more about this area, especially
those working in commercial publishing as well as research projects. A
number of key practitioners will be invited to discuss the core resources
available for text editing, and how expertise can be shared more widely.
Specifically, we are looking to see how the experience of those in academia
who teach and research text editing can contribute to the development of a
core set of training materials for those new to the field, and how we can
have better knowledge transfer around digital text editing.The underlying aim of the workshop is therefore to scope what is already
available in terms of training materials, and to develop a methodology to
assess different kinds of teaching material. This critical overview will
assist the community in the further development of teaching material for
text editing. As an output of the workshop, a basic and open curriculum
will be developed and published as an online resource by NeDIMAH.The workshop will be in English and is open to anyone interested in the
field of text editing; *some previous experience with text editing and/or
teaching is required.  *Please register on the EventBrite page

A
limited number of *travel bursaries are available* to postgraduates and
early career researchers in countries that are part of the NeDiMAH
network. If you wish to apply for a bursary, please contact the organisers
through the online form before *April 15*.With kind regards,
