Perhaps this occurs only in journals of literary scholarship -- but if I 
cite a recent reprint of a book or article, almost inevitably the editor 
or the readers insist that I go back to the original edition and make it 
the basis of my citations. I have always thought this was silly, as the 
more recent reprint may be the only available form in which most people 
can read the article -- but perhaps in the case of a Kindle edition, 
when it is actually an older print edition, one should seek out the 
original IF ONE CAN FIND OUT.  I recently looked at a Kindle version of 
a translation of Aristophanes "The Knights", which Amazon advertised as 
"new".  It was almost certainly not new, but there was no way at all of 
finding out where or when the print version had been done, or even who 
translated it. Amazon is doing no one a fvor with this kind of policy.
