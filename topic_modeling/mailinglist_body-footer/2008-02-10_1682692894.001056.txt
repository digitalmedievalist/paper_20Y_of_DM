Subject: Music in TEI SIG
To: TEI-L(a)listserv.brown.edu Dear all, a Special Interest Group for music encoding in TEI has been created.
 The goal of the SIG is to examine the current possibilities for
encoding both the physical representation of music and the aural
common elements between different notation systems, and to decide on a
preliminary recommendation/agenda for music encoding in the TEI,
whether directly via adoption of new elements or by importing a
recommended namespace from an existing external schema. The discussion will deal with issues like:
Encoding western music notation from all time periods, from ancient
through modern.
Encoding not only the music notation, but the aural aspects common to
different notation systems.
Encoding music and text together as well as music on its own. Everyone
interested is welcome to participate to our mailing list:

 and to our wiki:
