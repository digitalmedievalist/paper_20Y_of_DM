	Our Project RSS Server is now up and running properly. Please consider
this as a tool for distributing project announcements, releases of new
tools and utilities, or calls for papers.
	I hope to have a form up soon to allow you to submit material directly
to the editors all ready for syndication. In the meantime, I'll handle
formatting the announcements. Here's the minimum I would like from you
if you have an announcement:1) Title: A headline-type title for item (e.g. Project X Announces Y;
Call for Papers: (session/topic X) at (conference Y))2) Description: I.e. the news item itself; you can add links and basic
HTML structural coding (i.e. <p>, <ul>, etc.) if you wish.3) Contact Person: Preferably with an email address; this should be you
unless we agree otherwise (I don't want people being surprised to find
they are the contact on something they knew nothing about)4) Source of information (if not original to you), though most will be.I will assign a basic category to the news so we can search them later
by class.-dan
