I am sorry to have to say this, but why do people assume that because a book =
is in electronic format it should be free? I find it very strange than even t=
hose familiar with the work that goes into electronic publications would sugg=
est that it should be free of charge.
The site about Open Access referred to by Klaus is clearly intended for journ=
als and similar publications, not for works as the Exeter CD. Indeed, I canno=
t imagine approaching Andy Orchard, for example, and saying, "I always wanted=
 to buy _Pride and Prodigies_, but it is too expensive, could I have it for f=
ree?" This is the kind of publication we are talking about, not articles in j=
ournals; but incredibly complex publications that, more often than not, requi=
re the cooperation of a team of people.
Those who think that publishing on the internet is free should take into acco=
unt costs such as maintenance and upgrading. Someone has to care for the text=
s on the internet for these to remain available. In some cases, without unive=
rsity support, a private individual will even have to pay for the space on th=
e internet.
Of course we all want more access to primary materials and libraries are doin=
g a good job digitizing their books, making them available and maintaining th=
e sites. We should be happy that we can count on this and stop trying to get =
everything for free.Best,Barbara Bordalejo----- Original Message -----
