Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitOK can we decide where to hang out.  I've contacted Gabriel on the Wiki,
but there are 3 pages it could be:Digital classics 
Digital Classicist
Digital Medievalist (once created, of course)I suggest camping out at Digital classics as that is the parent article.
You need to stake out a position by establishing a big parent article
with lots of things linking **to** it.  Talk pages don't count.  The
best way is to find related articles, add in a section or just a
sentence that mentions digital techniques, then add a link to the parent
article.The parent article should be Digital classics in my view, but you guys
are the experts.Once you've got, say, 20 articles linking to it, then you have something
no one will ever delete, because it is so embedded.Next step is to make brief mentions of the 'child' articles.  Then
create the child articles.  These should not be too much like adverts.
Make a good case for the child article adding research or subject
interest.AND LOTS OF PICTURES!!!!  Wikipedians love pictures, I can't believe you
guys.  This is a subject area that is crying out for some beautiful
manuscript illustrations, carolingian whatsits, finials, you name it.  I
have stuff if you don't, but let's make a beautiful wonderful article.
Wikipedia is all about plumage.So, let's go.
