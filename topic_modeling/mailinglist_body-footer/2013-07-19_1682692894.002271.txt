OCLC: 806228661Linne Mooney, Dan Mosser, Elizabeth Solopova, and David Radcliffe are pleased=
 to take this opportunity at the Thirteenth Biennial Early Book Society Confe=
rence in St Andrews to announce the launch of The Digital Index of Middle Eng=
lish Verse. The project, begun in 1995 under the auspices of funding from the=
 National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), has been available as a prototy=
pe since 2008, and in its current structure since 2011. Additional support fr=
om the University of Maine, the Leverhulme Trust, University of York Departme=
nt of English and Related Literature, the Association for Manuscripts and Arc=
hives in Research Collections (AMARC), the Modern Humanities Research Associa=
tion (MHRA), College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences (Virginia Tech), and =
the NEH, have allowed us to realize almost all of what was envisioned in 1995=
: transcriptions of the first two and last two lines of every witness to ever=
y scrap of Middle English verse; a searchable database, with "SEARCH RECORDS"=
 options  enabling searches by specific DIMEV, IMEV, and NIMEV numbers, brows=
ing by alphabetic or number ranges, searches by AUTHOR, TITLE, SCRIBE, SUBJEC=
T, VERSE FORM, and VERSE PATTERN (or combinations of these); the "SEARCH WITN=
ESSES" option allows one to search MANUSCRIPTS by LOCATION and/or REPOSITORY;=
 lists of early PRINTED BOOKS and INSCRIPTIONS are also available. Where witn=
esses (MS shelfmarks, etc.) are highlighted, clicking on the witness name wil=
l compile a list of that manuscript's Middle English verse contents in their =
order of appearance in that witness.Where difficult or obsolete words are retained in the standardized headings, =
these are highlighted and linked to glosses, which may also be accessed by se=
lecting GLOSSARY from the menu on the SEARCH RECORDS page. There, too, are me=
nu selections DELETED RECORDS, or NEW RECORDS. Linguistic information is prep=
ended to many manuscripts when their records are viewed by clicking on their =
shelfmarks. An extensive BIBLIOGRAPHY of editions and facsimiles of Middle En=
glish Verse is also available through a menu selection.Should users detect any errors or be able to supply any missing transcription=
s or other data, or wish to make suggestions for improvement, please feel fre=
e to contact us:=20
