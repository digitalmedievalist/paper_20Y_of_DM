describing--the Ancient Texts Imaging Group at Brigham Young  
University uses multi-spectral imaging (first used by NASA) to read  
palimpsests and darkened papyrus damaged by fire.Here's an old article about the technology, though they're still  
active and were at the University of Michigan in the last couple of  
weeks imaging some of our papyrus collection:  
http://www.et.byu.edu/news_imaging.htmI know this works best if the two inks on top of each other are made  
of different compounds, so that one is enhanced as the other one fades  
(some work best with infrared rays, some with UV, etc).  However, I  
don't think this technology could be applied to scanned images--the  
leaves would have to be imaged again using the multi-spectral filters.Best,
Rebecca WelzenbachQuoting Grover Zinn <grover.zinn(a)oberlin.edu>:> Dear Dr. Wisnicki and All,
