pr=C3=B3ximamenteWe should like to announce the creation of a new project and community, hosted
by the Centre for Computing in the Humanities (KCL), applying humanities
computing to the study of the ancient world. The Digital Classicist has a pil=
ot
web site at http://www.digitalclassicist.org, which, as well as serving as a
placeholder for further content, sets out our aims and objectives in a
preliminary manner. As you will see, key sections of the website and summaries
of articles will, where possible, be translated into the major languages of
European scholarship: e.g. English, French, German, Italian, Spanish etc. The
project also comprises a discussion list, a Wiki, and a Blog.The project, which is committed to being ongoing and available in the long
term,
fills a gap in the current academic environment: there are countless important
digital research projects in the classics, including many that offer advice a=
nd
share tools; there are sites that discuss, host, or list such resources (the
Stoa, the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, Centre for the Study of
Ancient Documents in Oxford, EAGLE in Rome, to name but a few); but there is =
no
single platform for scholars and interested experts in the international and
polyglot community to discuss problems, share experiences, post news and
advice, and go to for help on all matters digital and classical. We shall of
course work closely with other organisations and projects that are active in
these areas (in particular the Stoa, and other subject communities such as the
Digital Medievalist, including specialists in archaeological, historical, and
geographical technologies), to avoid excessive overlap and maximise
co-operation and collaboration.At this point we especially need members of the international scholarly
community to contribute to the project. If you feel you could get involved in
an editorial capacity, or you could recommend somebody else to do so, please =
do
get in touch. There is no obligation that editors give up many hours of their
time, of course--editorial roles are discussed in a posting at
http://tinyurl.com/cpdsu . In addition we should be very grateful if you could
suggest other people--especially those in non-Anglophone Europe--who might be
interested in participating in this project in any way.And in any case, please spread the word, join the mailing list and get involv=
ed
in the discussions as we establish this new project and community.Best regards,The Editors
