journal Issue 8 are now available at <http://digitalmedievalist.org/journal/>=
. The new articles focus primarily on digitisation of manuscripts, in the for=
m of facsimile editions and 'codicology and palaeography in the Digital Age' =
more generally, as well as a qualitative study of the use of online manuscrip=
ts which relates to the current discussion on this list about digital scholar=
ly editions. There are further articles in the pipeline, including one  that =
will be available very soon on a digital edition of the medieval charters of =
St Denis.I want to take this opportunity to thank the editorial team for a lot of hard=
 work, and to remind you that we are always interested in new submissions to =
the journal. We operate a policy of rolling release, meaning that we publish =
articles as soon as they are available; this means in turn that we typically =
have a shorter time to publication than most traditional journals, though of =
course this depends on the time it takes for peer review and so on. Guideline=
s for submission are available from <http://digitalmedievalist.org/journal/1.=
1/submission/>.Happy reading, and we look forward to receiving your submissions.Peter=20--
