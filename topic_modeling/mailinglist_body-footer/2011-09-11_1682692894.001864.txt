well be that Nisus Writer Pro 2.0.1 will work.  It supports Arabic,  
bidirectional text, complex searches, etc.  You'd have to see from the  
web site or trial download if it will do the custom highlighting  
(somehow, from having used it a while back in earlier versions for  
projects, I suspect it will).bestGroverGrover A. Zinn
