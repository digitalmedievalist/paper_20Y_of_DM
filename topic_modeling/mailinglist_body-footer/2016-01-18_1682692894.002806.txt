that the overlap between the members of our official Mailing list and our
facebook community is minimal. This was quite a surprising result.
Both (de facto) communities are very active, and we wish to embrace, and to
interact with, both communities as much as possible.If you do use Facebook, you may be interested in following our facebook
group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/49320313760/You can also follow us on twitter (@digitalmedieval) and at
https://digitalmedievalist.wordpress.com/Thank you for being such an active community!Alberto Campagnolo
DM Director, on behalf of the Executive Board
