ALL WELCOMEWe will discuss the technical realisation and efficiency of several 
dimensions of detecting citations and apply them in the field of the 
Plato's aftermath. Central parts of this presentation are graph based 
approaches. Based on substantial experience of an ongoing collaboration 
between researchers of Classical Studies and Computer Science we shall 
also reflect on the different approaches to working with text.A full abstract along with the series programme can be found at:
