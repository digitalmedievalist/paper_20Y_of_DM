eakers for a session that will be held as part of the 2015 Symposium on Medie=
val and Renaissance Studies (http://smrs.slu.edu/index.html)=20Session title and description:
'Seeing the past through digital eyes: new approaches to visualizing medieval=
 texts and artifacts'=20What do we gain when our experience of a medieval text or artifact is through=
 a digital object rather than the original? The answer will depend on what to=
ols were used to create, find, and view the digital object. Today medievalist=
s can access online a wealth of photographs of manuscripts and artifacts, and=
 many repositories even allow researchers to use personal cameras to create t=
heir own photographs. The result has been a proliferation of visual material =
that enhance access, but which also raise new challenges and present novel op=
portunities for researchers. This session will bring together medievalists wh=
o use digital facsimiles and surrogates as part of their research to consider=
 how the tools they use to capture, manipulate, sort and present them impact =
the character of their scholarship. These tools can help scholars espousing l=
ong established methodologies, but they may also enable them to pose new ques=
tions and extend the scholarship in previously impractical directions.If you would be interested in participating, please send a proposed paper tit=
le and abstract by February 21. Apologies for the very near deadline...best wishes,
