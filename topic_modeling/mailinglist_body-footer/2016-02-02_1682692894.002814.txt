ania Libraries is pleased to announce its new semi-annual journal Manuscript =
Studies. This journal aims to bring together scholarship from around the worl=
d and across disciplines related to the study of pre-modern manuscript books =
and documents.
We are actively seeking submissions for 2017 and beyond. The journal is open =
to contributions that rely on both traditional methodologies of manuscript st=
udy and those that explore the potential of new ones. We seek articles that e=
ngage in a larger conversation on manuscript culture and its continued releva=
nce in today's world and highlight the value of manuscript evidence i=
n understanding our shared cultural and intellectual heritage. Studies that i=
ncorporate digital methodologies to further understanding of the physical and=
 conceptual structures of the manuscript book are encouraged. A separate sect=
ion, entitled Annotations, features research in progress and digital project =
reports. Book,  digital project, and exhibition reviews will also be included=
. For more information, go to http://mss.pennpress.org<http://mss.pennpress.o=
