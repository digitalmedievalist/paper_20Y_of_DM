p://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp.) found that a =
photograph of a two dimensional object could be copyrightable.  The finding c=
oncerned reproductions of paintings, but the logic seems absolutely applicabl=
e to manuscripts.  However, as he says: any recent images will very likely (i=
f the library knows what it is doing) be restricted by contract law.  So all =
kinds of questions come into play, about when the photoes were taken, who too=
k them, whether there was any statement, etc etc etc.By the way: some time ago I set up a mass digitization site, to try and gathe=
r support for a move towards high-volume digitization of medieval manuscripts=
.  Go see
http://www.canterburytalesproject.org/massdigit/
and there is a useful JISC mail list for this group.  I wish I could say that=
 this site made a huge difference, and mass digitization is sweeping the worl=
d.  It is not.PeterOn 28 Oct 2010, at 09:43, Peter Stokes wrote:> The technological aspects of such a repository wouldn't take a lot, but as =
Neven wrote the issue isn't technological, it's social and legal, at least fo=
r manuscripts. Personally I'd be amazed if libraries allowed it, not so much =
because of lost revenue and control (though that would be a factor), but more=
 because they're concerned about quality of images. If we publish less-than-f=
ully-professional images from a library, then the assumption tends to be that=
 it was the library who took the photos and therefore the imperfections are t=
heir 'fault'. That assumption may not seem valid, but (from what I understand=
) it's a very big concern for them.

> The legalities are extremely complicated, not just in terms of copyright in=
 all the relevant countries but also contract law. You may or may not have co=
pyright over your photo, but even if you do there was probably something in t=
he fine print saying that one condition of bringing in a camera is that you c=
an't distribute the photos that you take, and that condition will be legally =
binding. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but it needs to be done carefull=
y. Wikimedia Commons is an excellent example of how *not* to do it, in my opi=
nion. There's some interesting discussion from the Max Planck Institute on th=
e topic, including a possibly surprising level of openness from librarians, a=
t least in principle. See http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/en/news/features/fea=
ture4.
