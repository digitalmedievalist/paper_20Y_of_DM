Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitConal Tuohy built a little checker for Windows many years ago. And you 
can use any of the modern browsers to see if the character is on your 
system at all. I wonder could you use rich pasting into a word-processor 
or similar to discover the font name?E.g. create a page with the point, load it up in Firefox, if a character 
appears, copy and paste it into a wordprocessor and hope that font 
information has been preserved?I appreciate all the advice on utilities for SVN and the like: I don't 
have a Mac and have never really used one, so I'm happy to have names I 
can throw around. I find that the command line can be scary to people, 
so when I'm introducing lots of new concepts and techniques, I'm always 
happy if there is GUI-based software available at least initially!-danOn 11-02-06 01:29 PM, Simpson, Grant Leyton wrote:
