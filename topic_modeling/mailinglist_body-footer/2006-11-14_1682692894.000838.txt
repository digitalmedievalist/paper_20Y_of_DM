Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI have a Perl script that will assign absolute line numbers, and it 
can be tweaked not to assign line numbers to ascii lines beginning 
with <milestone, <lg, <fw, <marginalia, etc.  One can supply the </l> 
by a search/replace operation, or you could use another Perl script 
to assign </l>.  I'll be glad to supply these scripts if something 
more useful is not generally available.
Best,
