I would like to bring this message to your attention, for two reasons: 
the first is that, with the rather heavy traffic on TEI-L these days, it 
may have slipped your attention. The second is that maybe some people 
interested and/or involved in TEI digital editions may be DM subscribers 
while not following closely the discussions on TEI-L.
Please jump in and contribute :)
Best wishes, Marjorie

like to offer you an oportunity to make this future better by
contributing to the revision of a very important module :)During a workshop of the latest TEI MM in Zadar, it was decided, in the
work plan of the SIG for 2011, to start a special workgroup on the
critical apparatus chapter / module. This workgroup, which I've been
convening, has been discussing the issues of this module, trying to
identify its shortcomings and the ways it could be improved. We have
produced a document on the TEI Wiki, summarizing our email discussions:
http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Critical_Apparatus_WorkgroupThere have been several threads on the list, recently, about problems
related to the Critical Apparatus module. I would like to invite all
those who use the module, or would like to use it, to seize this
oportunity to share on the list (and/or on the wiki page) their feedback
on the Crit. App. module and chapter, the issues they have had while
working on TEI critical editions, or the good points they want to stress
in the module. Suggestions for improvement are, of course, welcome. The
outcome of the discussion will be discussed further during the SIG
meeting at the TEIMM 2011 in Würzburg.It strikes me that many people feel unhappy with this crucial module,
each time thinking that it's because the module has been designed with
other usages / users in mind: scholars interested in "born-digital"
editions representing the variance of a text complain that the module
has been designed with print editions in mind, while scholars wo
endeavour to encode a print edition complain that it's not adequate
either. There must be some way to make everybody happy - at least, why
not give it a try? ;)Best wishes,
Marjorie--
