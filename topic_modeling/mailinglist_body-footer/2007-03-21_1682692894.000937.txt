having to do with wikipedia.  I know that Dan has posted an entry on Caedmon
there, but I am not sure about any 'academic' regulators going out and looking
at the quality of any electronic publication - unless it is peer reviewed.TEI should have something to say about this. (http://www.tei-c.org/) 
Dan is the
one to talk to .  However, the TEI guidelines are a good place to start, I
think.However, for academic quality, I don't know if there any people going out of
their way to assess the quality of websites.  I am an Anglo-Saxonist, and I
know that there are many websites about the subject.  Some people stick to the
reliable ones by know academics.  For example, there is one by Simon Keynes, a
prominent historian from Cambridge, but many of the links he provides to other
pages don't work.  Also, there are many sites which have electronic texts and
study guides, like Peter Baker's Old English website, which is basically a
digital version of his book for free.I tend to think that electronic projects, compared to traditional ones, are
sometimes looked down upon simply because many people are not computer
literate, or they do not have enough resources in their departments to do the
project well.  I do think, though, that electronic projects are becoming more
collaborative due to the expertise of others, the costs, and the 
prestige.  For
example, we have a 3/4 million pound project at Manchester on medieval 
textiles
which is collaboration with Birmingham and Manchester Met., there is the PACE
project in London which is a collaboration with King's College and Cambridge,
and the LangScapes project which is another King's College project, and the
12th century manuscripts project with Leicester and Leeds universities.I think that what also makes these projects 'accepted' by the scholarly
community is that many of them have an advisory board which is made of of a
number of academics from various universities.I probably didn't answer any of your questions, but there you go.Best,
