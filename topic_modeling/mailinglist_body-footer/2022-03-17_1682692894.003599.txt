PEACE: The Portal on Jewish Funerary CultureFriday Mar 18, 2022, 17:00 GMTStreamed live at https://youtu.be/IUrKgB2JAv8The word =E2=80=9CPeace=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94Shalom=E2=80=94is frequently found o=
n funerary inscriptions marking the last resting place of Jewish people in an=
tiquity. Often, it is the only word inscribed in Hebrew letters, inserted int=
o an otherwise Greek or Latin epitaph. Our paper will present a new digital p=
roject titled PEACE, which stands for Portal of Epigraphy, Archaeology, Conse=
rvation and Education on Jewish Funerary Culture (https://peace.sites.uu.nl/)=
. The portal is currently found in its pilot stage, and focuses on epigraphic=
 data. It encompasses four epigraphical databases with different geographical=
 scopes (primarily ancient Palestine, Italy, Germany, and Spain), ranging fro=
m the 5th century BCE to the 20th century, comprising inscriptions painted on=
 catacomb walls as well as moulded on modern concrete. Bridging over these di=
fferences is the fact that all the partner databases use EpiDoc to encode the=
ir inscriptions. The PEACE portal allows to search all databases simultaneous=
ly, and subsequently detect patterns of historical importance within Jewish f=
unerary culture.PEACE employs the Elasticsearch engine for searching through the different da=
tabases and visualizing the results. Search results can also be filtered, for=
 instance according to sex of the persons mentioned on the inscription, their=
 age, location, and language. This allows for a richer analysis of the data. =
The portal pilot is not without its challenges, which range from a lack of un=
iformity in the data to the languages employed by the inscriptions. The latte=
r include Hebrew and Aramaic (RTL languages with no vocalization), Greek and =
Latin, alongside modern European languages, and some inscriptions comprise mo=
re than one language, or transliterations of one language into the alphabet o=
f another.Despite the challenges, the epigraphy pilot of the PEACE portal shows interes=
ting results. Queries of its 40,000 inscriptions outline fascinating patterns=
 across time and space, from onomastic preferences to the use of specific dat=
ing formats. As more databases join the portal, such patterns will become inc=
reasingly accurate and a better picture of Jewish funerary culture and its re=
lation with non-Jewish traditions will emerge.ALL WELCOME
