here http://www.infotext.unisi.it you can find some informations (in
Italian) about a Master in "Informatica del testo- Edizione elettronica"
that is running just now at the University of Siena in Arezzo (Engineering
& Letters Faculties), with some collaborations from CCH and Ecole des
Chartes and many connections with archives, libraries, publishers and
e-learning firms. It schedules on 10-11 July in Montepulciano an
international round-table about the status quaestionis on Digital Editions
that could be interesting for many of us.
One could think of a joint application for the Erasmus Mundus programme.
Other informations about the situations of digital learning in Italy are
to be find on the website

Francesco Stella--===============0361194763220695462==--
