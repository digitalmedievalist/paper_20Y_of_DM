'From Stone to Byte: Implications of the XML publication of inscriptions'ALL WELCOMEWhile there have always been conventions of marking-up Classical
texts, the study and publication of literary texts have evolved
separately from documentary materials. The corpus of ancient verse is
enormously enlarged by the large number of verse inscriptions found
inscribed on stone – principally funerary verse. Scholarly traditions
have made it difficult to look at 'literary' and documentary' verse
together. This kind of barrier can perhaps at last be surmounted by
the intelligent use of TEI XML, although tensions will remain.The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk or
