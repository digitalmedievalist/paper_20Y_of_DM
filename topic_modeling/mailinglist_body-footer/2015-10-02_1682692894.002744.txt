VK=E2=80=9D is the master list of Old and Middle English scientific and medic=
al texts. It can be accessed either via the (U.S.) National Library of Medici=
ne (a clumsy interface, in my opinion) or via the link on the Medieval Academ=
y of America site, under =E2=80=9Cdigital tools,=E2=80=9D which will lead you=
 to: http://cctr1.umkc.edu/search.There's a listserv for pre-modern medicine, where you could get lots =
of advice if you're a novice in the field. Feel free to contact me if=
 you want more info.Monica H. Green

Subject: Re: [dm-l] Search for an English unedited medieval manuscriptDear Johanna,I don't check the listserv often, so apologies for my late reply. UPenn has s=
even Middle English manuscripts, they are all described but perhaps one of th=
em is unedited? Here's a list; click on any title, then click the "View Prove=
nance and Subject" tab at the top of the image viewing window and scroll down=
 to Indexed / Referenced in for details:http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/search.html?fq=3Dlanguage_facet%3A%22=
English%2C%20Middle%20%281100-1500%29%22All seven mss have been digitized.Let me know if any of these are unedited - I'm curious!DotOn Mon, Sep 21, 2015 at 6:40 AM, Johanna Feenstra <trust-your-voice(a)hotmail=

Dear readers,At this moment I am a research student at the University of Groningen. For a =
course I need to make an edition of a manuscript belonging to my field of exp=
ertise.
In my case this is the English Middle Ages. However, after asking many of my =
professors I have not yet come across a satisfying manuscript. Perhaps you ca=
n help me out!
I am looking for a medieval manuscript in the English vernacular (Old/Middle =
English) which had not yet been edited. I am aware this query is far-fetched,=
 but I am willing to try anyway.
With regard to the content of the manuscript, my preference goes out to somet=
hing related to magic, charms, bestiary (cats are a pro), supernatural, roman=
ce ect. However, even if you might happen to know a manuscripts that only inc=
ludes the content preferences, I am very eager to learn about it still. Of co=
urse, the same stands for the first preference: A unedited manuscript with an=
y other content is also very welcome.I hope some of you have suggestions and I am looking forward to your replies.Best regards,J. FeenstraDigital Medievalist --  http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/
