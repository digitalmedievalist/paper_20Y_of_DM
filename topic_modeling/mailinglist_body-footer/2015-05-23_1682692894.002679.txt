This workshop will serve three overlapping purposes.
First, it will introduce the Textual Communities system for creating scholarl=
y editions in digital form. Textual Communities allows scholars and scholarly=
 groups to make highest-quality editions in digital form, with minimal specia=
list computing knowledge and support.  It is particularly suited to the makin=
g of editions which do not fit the pattern of =E2=80=9Cdigital documentary ed=
itions=E2=80=9D: that is, editions of works in many manuscripts or versions, =
or editions of non-authorial manuscripts. Accordingly, Textual Communities in=
cludes tools for handling images, page-by-page transcription, collation of mu=
ltiple versions, project management, and more. See the draft article describi=
ng Textual Communities athttps://www.academia.edu/12297061/Some_principles_fo=
r_the_making_of_collaborative_scholarly_editions_in_digital_form.
Second, it will offer training to transcribers joining the Canterbury Tales p=
roject, and to scholars leading transcription teams within the project.  The =
project is undertaking the transcription of all 30,000 pages of the 88 pre-15=
00 witnesses of the Tales (18000 pages already transcribed but requiring chec=
king; 12000 needing new transcription). Participants will be given accounts w=
ithin the Textual Communities implementation of the Canterbury Tales project,=
 introduced to the transcription system, and undertake their first transcript=
ions of pages from the Tales.  See http://www.textualcommunities.usask.ca/web=
/canterbury-tales/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Becoming+a+transcriber.
Third, it will offer an introduction to the principles of manuscript transcri=
ption for digital editions to any scholars or students considering undertakin=
g a digital edition project based on a manuscript. The materials of the Cante=
rbury Tales project will be used as a starting point for discussion of transc=
ription, supplemented by reference to other textual traditions on which the w=
orkshop leaders have worked (including Dante, medieval Spanish and New Testam=
ent Greek).
This workshop will be useful to scholars undertaking a wide range of digital =
edition projects, especially of works existing in multiple witnesses.  Becaus=
e both the architect of Textual Communities (Robinson) and its chief programm=
er (Xiaohan Zhang) will be present, it will be useful also for technical cons=
ultants who plan to work with the Textual Communities API. And, of course, it=
 will be useful for transcribers joining the Canterbury Tales project.
There is no charge for this workshop, but places will be limited.  Please con=
tact Barbara Bordalejo barbara.bordalejo(a)kuleuven.be<mailto:barbara.bordale=
jo(a)kuleuven.be> or Peter Robinson peter.robinson(a)usask.ca<mailto:peter.ro=
