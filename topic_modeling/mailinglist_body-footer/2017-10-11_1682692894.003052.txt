ital Age
November 2-4, 2017
Intertwined WorldsIn partnership with the Rare Book Department<https://libwww.freelibrary.org/r=
arebooks/index.cfm> of the Free Library of Philadelphia, the Schoenberg Insti=
tute of Manuscript Studies (SIMS<http://schoenberginstitute.org/>) at the Uni=
versity of Pennsylvania Libraries is pleased to announce the 10th Annual Lawr=
ence J. Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age.Despite the linguistic and cultural complexity of many regions of the premode=
rn world, religion supplies the basis of a strong material and textual cohesi=
on that both crosses and intertwines boundaries between communities. This yea=
r's theme, "Intertwined Worlds," will highlight the confluence of expressions=
 of belief, ritual, and social engagement emerging in technologies and tradit=
ions of the world's manuscript cultures, often beyond a single religious cont=
ext. It will consider common themes and practices of textual, artistic, liter=
ary, and iconographic production in religious life across time and geography,=
 from ancient precedents to modern reception and dissemination in the digital=
 age.This year's symposium features a keynote address by Phyllis Granoff, Lex Hixo=
n Professor of Religious Studies, Yale University, on "The Mystery of Mistake=
s: Reflections on Indian Illustrated Manuscripts," to be held at the Free Lib=
rary of Philadelphia at 6pm,on November 2, 2017 (reception beginning at 5pm).For more information and to register, please go to: http://www.library.upenn.=
