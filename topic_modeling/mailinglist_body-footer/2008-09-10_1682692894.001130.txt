Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitPostdoctoral Fellow in Early Modern Textual Studies and Digital Humanities
(2009-11)The Electronic Textual Cultures Laboratory  (ETCL) [URL: <
http://etcl.uvic.ca/ >] at the University of Victoria has an exciting
two-year postdoctoral opportunity for a candidate with a background in early
modern literary and textual studies, expertise in computing, and an interest
in the digital humanities field.The postdoctoral fellow will be key in the development of a professional
reading environment designed to respond to the needs of those working with
early modern books and manuscripts. Source material for this work will be
derived from our work on the Devonshire Manuscript (BL Add MS 17,492) and
our ongoing work with professional reading environments in number of related
projects.The successful candidate will have skills and aptitudes in early modern
research, textual studies, and scholarly editing in a digital humanities
context, including training or demonstrated experience working with TEI XML
and digital editions. Organizational skills are essential. Interest and
aptitude in research planning and management would be an asset. The ability
to work in concert with our existing team is a critical requirement.Examples of technologies employed in related ETCL projects are as follows:
TEI P5; XML, XSLT, XSL and XHTML encoding; XQuery; eXist XML databases;
JavaScript; Ruby on Rails; PHP; CSS; and web-based SQL database projects
using PostgresSQL and mySQL. Experience in some or all of these areas would
be an asset, but is not a requirement, though aptitude with digital tools is
required.Our current team members pride themselves on a passionate interest in both
the humanities and their computation engagement. Our ideal candidate is
someone with similar passions who can introduce the team to new ideas and
provide new perspectives on existing digital humanities issues.Salary for this position is competitive in the Canadian context, and is
governed in part by SSHRC practices; combined with a local supplement, the
annual salary for this position is expected to be $52,000, inclusive of
benefits and travel allowances.Applications, comprising a brief cover letter, CV, and the names and contact
information for three referees, may be sent electronically to
<etcl.apply(a)gmail.com>.  Applications will be received and reviewed until
the position is filled; the position can begin as early as January 2009.
