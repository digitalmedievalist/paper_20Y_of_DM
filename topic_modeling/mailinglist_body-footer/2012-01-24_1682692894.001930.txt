(London) is re-starting its regular discussion meetings on: * Tuesday 31 January 18:30 *at The Plough, 27 Museum Street, WC1A 1LH.For this first meeting we will be discussing the Digital Humanities Manifesto:http://tcp.hypotheses.org/411Decoding Digital Humanities began as an informal series of pub
meetings organised by the Centre for Digital Humanities at UCL. It has
since expanded with several international chapters but still retains
its informal atmosphere.You will be very welcome to join us for a drink and to discuss all
things DH. We look forward to seeing you there.Best,
Richard
