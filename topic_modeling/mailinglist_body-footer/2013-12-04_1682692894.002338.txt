The seminar will be followed by wine and festive nibbles.All the best,Valentina AsciuttiAbstract: The French word "D=C3=A9tournement", loosely translatable as hijack=
ing, leading astray or appropriation, describes the sideways or "alt" use of =
computer applications outside their original fields: for example the use of m=
edical imaging software to make movies, of spelling checkers to scramble text=
, or of fluid behaviour modelling software to make drawings. It is a two-way =
process and win-win situation, because "unauthorised" or simply crazy uses of=
 apps can feed back ideas into their mainstream application as well as leadin=
g to creative splurges in other disciplines. Examples, some interactive, will=
 be shown of hijacking computer software and iPad apps into areas of art, sou=
nd, text, cognitive psychology and because of the venue, anatomy (it is recom=
mended not to eat before this seminar).Bio: Brian Reffin Smith is a writer, artist, theoretician, zombie and musicia=
n. He has spent about 40 years teaching ideas of "d=C3=A9tournement", using t=
hem for art and writing about them, and is a pioneer of computer based concep=
tual art. He won the very first Golden Nike (the 'Oscars' of computer art) at=
 Ars Electronica, Linz, Austria and his art and text works are shown internat=
ionally. His fields of activity are computer-based art and general creativity=
, performance art, Zombie studies and 'Pataphysics, the science of imaginary =
solutions. He is a book reviewer for Leonardo. He was for 25 years a French c=
ivil servant, as Professeur, Art et Informatique, in the =C3=89cole Nationale=
 Sup=C3=A9rieure d'Art, Bourges, France. He holds the Chair of Catachemistry =
and Speculative Metallurgy in the Paris-based Collége de 'Pataphysique, =
and lives in Berlin, Germany.--===============3282919566127706072==
