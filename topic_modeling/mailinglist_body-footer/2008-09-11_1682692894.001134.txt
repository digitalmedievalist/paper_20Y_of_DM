taken down today for some essential maintenance.  Only minor
complications were encountered in what was a long overdue set of
upgrades through 4 operating system versions, and I believe these have
been resolved.  It is hoped that this upgrade will solve a driver
mismatch problem that was causing occasional downtime when the virtual
machine would fail to restart properly whenever the VM servers at
University of Lethbridge had a problem which necessitated their own
restart.  Simultaneous to the multiple upgrades, some other underlying
changes (hopefully invisible) were made which will allow further
development of our journal production workflow.If you notice any problems with the site feel free to email either
myself or tech(a)digitalmedievalist.org.Apologies for any inconvenience,James Cummings
