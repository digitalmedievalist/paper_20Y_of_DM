the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image at the University of
Pennsylvania is pleased to announce the creation of the Seymour de Ricci
Bibliotheca Britannica Manuscripta Digitized Archive, a corollary project to
the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts. The archive is a searchable database containing the digitized notes of the
historian and bibliographer Seymour Montefiore Robert Rosso de Ricci
(1881-1942) made for the compilation of his unfinished census of pre-1800
manuscripts in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  De Ricci's notes,
compiled in thirty-four boxes containing over 60,000 index cards, are
currently housed in the Senate House Library. The first cards are now
available online in downloadable pdf format. More will become available as
they are scanned and processed. New cards will be added daily until the
project is completed in the Summer of 2011. To learn more and access the archive, go to
