between data, resources (maybe), and projects.* Projects create and/or analyse data. They have a definite beginning 
and end and they are run by somebody. This means the main preservation 
problem is how you keep them going until they "finish." Once they 
finish, their outputs are either data or resources or both. An example 
of a project might be the production of edition of a text, a monograph, 
journal article, or a specific edition of a dictionary or an encyclopedia.
* Data are created by projects. They are in essence static (though they 
can be corrected or revised). Ideally they can be reused by other 
projects, either with or without negotiation (though this is in practice 
often very difficult). The preservation problem with data is hosting and 
discoverability. Examples of data might be photos, 3D scans, 
transcriptions, edited texts, editions of dictionaries or encyclopedias, 
monographs and journal articles, and so on.
* Resources are things that provide access to data: e.g. digital 
libraries, edition interfaces, dictionary or edition interfaces, and so 
on. These are things that may need to be actively maintained and updated 
if they are to remain useful. Examples of resources include encyclopedia 
or dictionary sites, journals, perhaps monograph series, scholarly 
societies, and so on.If this makes sense, then I think the organisational issues are 
different in each case.* With projects, the transfer is always going to be negotiated: you are 
talking about a small group of people who share a common goal and 
understanding of the project (more or less) and when a transfer happens, 
you are going to see a handoff: one leader or group hands off control to 
another under specific conditions. Projects are usually organised around 
a single leader, or a couple of co-leaders, or a small board. The 
problem for projects is really the same, whether the project is 
paper-based or digital.* For data, you are looking for maintenance that is as hands off as 
possible and transfer that can happen without negotiation. The important 
question here is whether the data is discoverable, comprehensible, and 
accessible. Hence Peter's point about licencing, for example, and about 
institutional repositories or the Oxford Text Archive. For data, you 
don't really need a board or a chair or anything else (in fact if you 
need it, it is probably not being well stored). You need some 
institution that is already established and is willing to accept your 
data under conditions you both find acceptable as part of its mission. 
Universities and libraries are good methods for this. Again, the problem 
is not really too dissimilar between paper and digital: you want as much 
as possible to give your data in static form to an institution that is 
set up to preserve it.* Resources are the hardest things to preserve, because there is no 
obvious end date, but they may require active intervention. Because of 
this, I think you should do everything you can to avoid creating them. 
If you are designing an edition, you should design it so that it 
degrades well over time and can be treated like data (whether as a whole 
or in its component parts). This means making use of components that are 
built into the architecture of the web as much as possible and 
separating content from processing. Good examples include Stuart Lee's 
edition of Ã†lfric's sermons, Murray McGillvray's Book of the Duchess, 
I'd argue my edition of Caedmon's Hymn, any post P2 version of the TEI. 
A famously poor example (though it isn't their fault) is the BBC's 
Domesday Project from the late 1980s. The exceptions to this rule are 
by-and-large not research projects: scholarly societies, for example, 
are resources rather than projects or data, but if they stop, it is 
because nobody is interested in them anymore. MESA is a resource that 
referees data. But if it dies, the data still survives. If you do build 
a resource (for example, a journal or a scholarly society), you should 
do everything you can to ensure that it degrades to data when people 
lose interest in it: so your journals should be hosted by or mirrored at 
universities and archives, for example, and should not depend too much 
on dynamic libraries for expression.So in the end the answer to your question might be this: do everything 
you can to avoid creating a resource. Make sure that your data 
production is tied to a project rather than a resource and has a 
definite end-point in sight. If you want to create data that others will 
revise and add to after you are finished with it, don't try to be the 
arbiter of the quality of their interventions. Understand what they are 
doing as independent projects that are responsible for seeking their own 
quality assurance. Create URLs or other identifiers that archives can 
administer without your help. Publish guidelines and suggestions for how 
subsequent generations might add to your data, but give up on enforcing 
them.In other words, try to imitate the Chaucer of the epilogue to Troilus 
and Criseyde  ("go litel bok, go little myn tragedie") rather than the 
Chaucer of the epilogue to the Canterbury Tales ("...the whiche I revoke 
in my retracciouns").On 13-06-21 03:51 PM, Michelson, David Allen wrote:
