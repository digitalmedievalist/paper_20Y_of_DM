conservation (that is, stabilizing and restoring physical objects--think
tiny brushes, adhesives, etc.) or digitization (creating and managing images
of physical objects like manuscripts).In the first instance, she'll need a solid background in chemistry, among
other things, to move forward. In the second, her training in digital
photography/imaging is probably a good start.If she's interested in all of it, I recommend that she consider
library/information school. At the very least, she should check out any
preservation/digitization projects going on at the Northern Iowa University
Library to learn more about the field.  If there's not a separate
preservation department, the archivist or special collections librarian is
probably a good place to start.I'm certainly biased since this is the route I took, but in my program (the
University of Michigan's School of information, which offers a
specialization in preservation http://si.umich.edu/msi/pi.htm) I had
opportunities to do physical conservation/preservation work and to work on
digitization projects.Iowa State University offers a preservation internship that I've heard
spoken of very highly, but it is open only to graduate students in this
field: http://www.lib.iastate.edu/narrative-main/4010/11041Good luck to her!
