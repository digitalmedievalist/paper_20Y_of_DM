Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableI have just been granted funding for a PhD student in digital medieval litera=
ry or linguistic (OE, ME) studies, to commence September 2014 or January 2015=
. The student will be fully funded for four years. The "Eyes High" scholarshi=
p itself is worth $25K Cdn per year for a Canadian applicant, $30K Cdn per ye=
ar for a non-Canadian. That amount will be reduced to an $8K top-up per year =
if the student wins, as is expected, major external funding such as a Social =
Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada doctoral fellowship. The f=
unding from the "Eyes High" scholarship would also be supplemented with fundi=
ng from my own grants and/or with teaching assignments in my department, for =
somewhere in the area of an additional $15K per annum.The doctoral project would need to be in the general area described above, an=
d would ideally complement or be part of my own ongoing editorial projects, e=
specially the Online Corpus of Old English Poetry or its planned Aelfrician e=
xtension, the probable target of my next research grant application. A strong=
 background in digital humanities work is very desirable but lack of one is n=
ot necessarily a deal-breaker for a highly-qualified candidate.Turn-around is very tight. I will need an expression of interest by 20 Februa=
ry in order to consider anyone as a candidate; this should include a CV and i=
f possible transcripts of your academic record. Applicants need to have a com=
pleted Masters degree by the time of taking up the studentship. My candidate =
needs to be submitted to our university approvers by 10 March.Please do feel free to pass this information along to anyone (and any listser=
vs) you think might be interested. I'm happy to answer questions about this (=
private mail, please, not the list) but will be travelling for part of the ne=
xt week so may not be as prompt as you would like in replying.Murray McGillivray
