Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear colleagues,Last year, I annouced you the opening of a new MA in Digital and Computationa=
l Humanities at Paris Sciences & Lettres University. After its first year of =
existence, I am glad to announce that we are recruiting students again for ne=
xt year. We would be very glad to receive applications from students with a b=
ackground in medieval studies, a field strongly present in the institutions t=
hat participate to this degree (=C3=89cole des chartes, =C3=89cole pratique d=
es hautes =C3=A9tudes, =C3=89cole des hautes =C3=A9tudes en sciences sociales=
 and =C3=89cole normale sup=C3=A9rieure).This degree is research-oriented, and aims to be at the intersection of the h=
umanities and data science. Students follow half their courses in the field o=
f the humanities in which they specialise themselves (we have classes on a gr=
eat variety of subjects, from palaeography, diplomatics, philology, codicolog=
y, epigraphy, to historical anthropology or economic history, and a variety o=
f geographic and linguistic areas, from Latin to Hebrew or medieval Hindi). I=
n the other half of their courses, we teach them data manipulation, programmi=
ng (Python, R), deep learning, statistics and mathematical modelling.The deadline for application is the 29 june 2018, with a possible second row =
of applications  in september.The English prospectus can be found at: http://www.chartes.psl.eu/sites/defau=
lt/files/atoms/files/flyer-master-humanites-anglais_0.pdfAnd more information here: http://www.chartes.psl.eu/en/cursus/ma-digital-hum=
anitiesMost courses are in French, and a familiarity of the  applicants with the lan=
guage is advised, though there are some opportunities for students to follow =
 courses of French as a foreign language.=20Do not hesitate to forward to anyone that might be interested.Best wishes,
Jean-Baptiste Camps--===============1372155704260715738==--
