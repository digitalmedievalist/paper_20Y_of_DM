===
== Interedition - An Interoperable Supranational Infrastructure for Digital
Editions ==
== 19-20 March 2011, Huygens ING, The Hague, The Netherlands ==Huygens ING is pleased to host a symposium to mark the achievements of
Interedition, COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action
IS0704. This event will also serve as a springboard for further work based
on the principles of interoperability promoted by Interedition within the
domain of digital scholarly editing and research.One of the key objectives of Interedition has been to produce a ‘roadmap’
conceptualizing the development of a technical infrastructure for
collaborative digital preparation, editing, publication, analysis and
visualization of literary research materials. Interedition has approached
the problem of interoperable infrastructure from the perspectives of
methodology, technology, and community. At present Interedition is
realizing the ‘nuts and bolts’ of a bottom-up generalizable architecture,
focusing on the development community and the prototyping of distributed
lightweight services. This grassroots approach is emerging from the ‘engine
rooms’ where Web 2.0 digital editions are being built and promises a
generalizable and viable approach to collaborative digital humanities tool
building.Creators and/or users of tools for textual scholarship are invited to
submit paper proposals dealing with tools and methodologies that promote,
exemplify, and otherwise address the issues of interoperability and
sustainability in the field of digital scholarly editing and research. In
particular, we encourage papers which address, but are not limited to the
following areas:  * Development and application of tools to achieve interoperability and
sustainability in the arena of digital textual scholarship
  * Development methodology and the problem of bottom-up versus top-down
approaches
  * Development and application of tools for digital scholarly editions
  * Theoretical and practical problems of digital editing and scholarly
information exchange
  * Community and user aspects of interoperability in textual scholarship
  * Crowd sourcing solutions
  * Architectural approaches towards interoperability for tools in digital
scholarship
  * Digital techniques and methodologies from scholars working on textual
data in the humanitiesSpeakers are asked to submit abstracts of 750 words. This should also
include the names, titles, institutional affiliations, addresses, phone
numbers and email addresses of all authors. Abstracts must be submitted via
email to joris.van.zundert(a)huygens.knaw.nl by 15 January 2012.Please note that we will be publishing the proceedings and that
contributions will be peer reviewed.A bursary scheme will be in place to facilitate travel and accommodation
for selected papers. Details will be forthcoming*** Keeping true to Interedition’s principles a bootcamp oriented towards
collaborative coding opportunities for researchers/developers will be
attached to this symposium. More details about this will be forthcoming. ***Further details will be available at: http://www.interedition.eu/== Symposium organizing committee ==
