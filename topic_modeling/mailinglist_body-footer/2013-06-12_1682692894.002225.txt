 never even look at Blogs! That said,
a web page like face book is a nice web presence - as long as all the importa=

Subject: Re: [dm-l] Mailing List, Wiki, Blog or what?I have some experience in building communities, and I'd say that you
should always see the mailing list as core. This is because it pushes
information out, but also because it serves as a locus of identity:
while people complain about list traffic if it gets too high, they
nevertheless do tend to subscribe. Lists like dm-l and globaloutlookdh-l
even have people who subscribe and then set themselves to no mail!In a modern community, I think you want to supplement the list with some
other things and try, as much as possible, to see the different channels
as different portals into roughly the same information set:* You need a twitter feed, since many people follow things that way;
* You should have a blog for larger items; personally, I'd try to
encourage people to contribute guest postings to it, but I've found that
hard. I've wondered about somehow using syndication capabilities as a
way of capturing content.
* You want a news service for community announcements--that does tend to
get used if you promote it.
* I'm less convinced that wikis work that well for most communities.Ideally, all should be integrated: so blog posts should be announced on
twitter and the mailing list; announcements should go to the mailing
list and twitter and show up on the blog (maybe in a sidebar); I wonder
if it wouldn't make sense to somehow capture the list traffic on the
blog as well: perhaps by adding a page that includes the archive or
posting a digest each day as a posting. But I've not worked out any good
ideas on how to do that.-danOn 13-06-11 12:42 PM, Carl Edlund Anderson wrote:
