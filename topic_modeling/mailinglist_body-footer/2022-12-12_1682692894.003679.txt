Hello all,I am Haripriya Mehta, an MIT alum, co-founder of MehtA+<https://mehtaplustuto=
ring.com/>, based in the US and head instructor of AI/Machine Learning Resear=
ch bootcamp.For the past few summers, we have successfully taught 75+ high school student=
s, who have applied advanced AI/machine learning techniques to the digital hu=
manities and the sciences, completing projects independently and with univers=
ities such as Northeastern University<https://wwp.northeastern.edu/blog/machi=
ne-learning/>, University of Buffalo SUNY, Singapore Institute of Technology =
and University of Bologna, Italy.Examples of past projects<https://github.com/MehtaPlusTutoring/studentproject=
s/tree/main/aimlresearchbootcamp> include predicting weather-related flight d=
elays, dating an Italian philosopher's texts using handwriting recognition, c=
lassifying whether a patient has melanoma using images of skin lesions, chart=
ing the evolution of the word "que" in the Spanish language, determining the =
author of disputed Federalist papers and analyzing sentiment of tweets for st=
ock price prediction.For this upcoming summer, we are looking to partner up with scholars (profess=
ors/PhD students/postdocs) in the sciences/engineering/humanities in need of =
help in applying AI techniques to their work. Our staff will mentor students =
on computational aspects of the project, and the scholar will volunteer their=
 time to provide datasets and domain knowledge that will help students work o=
n the project. Expected time commitment would be ~2-4 hours during the summer=
. Projects that are of a predictive/classification nature, and that may invol=
ve natural language processing or image recognition are ideal for this camp.If there are other computational projects (app development/web development, e=
tc.) that you would like our students' help with or if you are unsure if AI/m=
achine learning techniques that we teach in our camp will be applicable to yo=
ur work, please still feel free to reach out! Our students have created a mob=
ile app for an educational startup, an educational website for a kidney trans=
plant surgeon and are working on a data visualization for the University of B=
uffalo SUNY's Marianne Moore Digital Archive.If you know anyone who would be interested in such a collaboration, please fe=
el free to forward this email.I would be happy to hop on a Zoom call with you if you would like to discuss =
this more.Thanks.Sincerely,Haripriya MehtaCo-founder of MehtA+hpm(a)mehtaplustutoring.com<mailto:hpm(a)mehtaplustutoring.com>--===============4953113072843320064==
