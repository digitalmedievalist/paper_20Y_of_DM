with multiple hierarchies in this analysis, but he discussed databases
that allow handling annotated text, which seems quite close to what you
are doing.He cited an open source database program he was planning to use that is
designed for this type of work: http://emdros.org/index.htmlDon't know if it is for you, but it is an idea.-danOn Mon, 2006-06-11 at 00:23 +0000, Abdullah Alger wrote:
