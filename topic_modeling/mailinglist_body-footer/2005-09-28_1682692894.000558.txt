Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI use xsltproc quite a bit, since it is fast and has a very good 
implementation of XSLT 1.0 (in my experience it always agrees with Xalan 
and Saxon). I haven't heard whether it implements XSLT 2.0; the docs are 
sketchy, to say the least. I doubt that it does. It reads a DTD to 
resolve entities, but I don't think it validates, and I don't think it 
can use other kinds of schema. So you've got to use another tool to 
validate your doc before running it, and if you absolutely need to use 
say RelaxNG to resolve entities it may not be suitable.Saxon seems the heavier duty app, but xsltproc is stable and good for 
most purposes.PeterDaniel Paul O'Donnell wrote:>Hi all, I just discovered xsltproc in linux. Does anybody know what XSL
