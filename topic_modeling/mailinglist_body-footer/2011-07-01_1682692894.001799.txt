>OBJECTIVES:
>
>The Semantic Digital Archives Workshop aims at promoting and
>discussing sophisticated knowledge representation and knowledge
>management solutions specifically designed for improving Archival
>Information Systems.

>Over the past couple of decades, digitally created content has come to
>permeate all aspects of our lives and the life cycle of these objects
>is increasingly exclusively digital. Therefore, sustainable long-term
>curation perspectives for our digital cultural heritage are essential.
>Digital content poses many socio-cultural and technological challenges
>which create obstacles to long-term or indefinite preservation.
>Changing technologies and shifting user communities as well as the
>increasing complexity of digital content being enriched with software
>and multimedia attachments are only a few examples. Dealing with these
>challenges is the central theme of the workshop.
>
>This full day workshop is an exciting opportunity for collaboration
>and cross-fertilization between the Digital Libraries, the Digital
>Archives and the Semantic Web community. It specifically encourages
>closer dialogue between the technical oriented communities and
>researchers from the (digital) humanities and social sciences as well
>as cultural heritage institutions.

>TOPICS OF INTEREST:

>We intend to have an open discussion on topics related to the general
>subject of Semantic Digital Archives. The following list of topics is
>meant as an initial guide.
>Hence, we welcome contributions that focus on, but are not limited to:
>
>* ontologies and linked data for digital archives and digital
>libraries, e.g. semantic extensions of common knowledge models of the
>digital archiving and digital libraries domain, e.g. METS, EAD,
>PREMIS, ...
>* ontologies and (semantic) web services implementing the OAIS standard
>* theoretical and practical archiving frameworks extending or
>replacing the OAIS standard
>* logical theories for digital archives
>* implementations and evaluations of digital archives
>* semantic or logical provenance models for digital archives or
>digital libraries
>* information integration/semantic ingest (e.g. from digital libraries)
>* trust for ingest and data security/integrity check for long-term
>storage of archival records
>* semantic search and semantic information retrieval in digital
>archives and digital libraries
>* visualization and exploration of digital content (stored or to be
>stored in a digital archive)
>* semantic extensions of emulation/virtualization methodologies
>tailored for digital archives
>* migration strategies based on semantic (web) technologies
>* semantic long-term storage and hardware organization tailored for AIS
>* (empirical) studies evaluating end-user needs and its evolution as
>well as information seeking behaviour of end-user needs and its
>evolution
>* knowledge evolution
>* web archiving
