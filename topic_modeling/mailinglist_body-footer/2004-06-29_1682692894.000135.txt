There is the feeling that many have that once you strip away the markup,=20
you should be left with a bare version of 'the text'.  They argue that=20
all such alternatives should be stored in attributes (even with the
aforementioned problems) in order to separate the interpretation from=20
the text.  But the problems with this are legion.  Aside from the
obvious need for markup inside these interpretative readings, the=20
choice of markup itself is, of course, an interpretation of structure=20
that they are imposing on the text. (That way lies overlapping=20
hierarchy discussion again...)  Moreover, the same process of=20
stripping away the markup to reveal 'the text' is still simplistically=20
possible, it is just that the act of 'stripping' in this case doesn't=20
mean 'remove the tags' but instead process them so that 'the text'=20
is the result.  Whether 'the text' is with corrections made,
abbreviations expanded, spelling regularised, or any of the other=20
possible applications of this <choice> type of encoding is a=20
decision that is made at the point of processing.  But, I'm sure=20
you know all this and I'm preaching to the converted. ;-)-James---
