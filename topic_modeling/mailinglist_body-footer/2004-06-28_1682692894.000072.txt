Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThis is an interesting thread in as much as it touches on best practice. 
Leaving aside the server vs. client side serving of xml for a minute (do 
most people still not convert xml to (x)html and serve static pages?), 
surely it isn't that hard to produce pages that work on both Internet 
Explorer and proper browsers? I've always followed what I've thought as 
Peter Baker's philosophy (perhaps he can correct me if I'm wrong) of 
adopting "works well on standards based browsers, is neither broken nor 
egregiously ugly on Internet Explorer" in my design. The place where I 
am most aware of this is with floating menus (as in the dm site 
<www.digitalmedievalist.org>). These stay put in standards-based 
browsers, but scroll in MSIE. If and when IE does these properly, there 
are no work arounds to content with: the menu will float for IE users as 
well.I am a little more concerned about the need for some work-arounds, 
mostly because it produces bad coding that won't age gracefully when IE 
gets with the program. One place is, for example, the min- and max-width 
instructions in CSS. I use a workaround that takes advantage of the fact 
that MSIE doesn't understand child rules expressed using a "greater than 
sign" to turn off styles MSIE specific styles. I suppose this is 
harmless, though it is annoying.I have been thinking lately of offering users multiple stylesheets to 
allow them to customise pages to suit their equipement, interests, 
and/or disabilities. Thus users with larger screens might like to see 
more options on a menu; or visually impaired users might prefer their 
links to be underlined. Of course, once again, most standards based 
browsers have a style sheet switcher option built in, which means MSIE 
doesn't. There are some simple solutions however. If you'd like to see 
one in action, the CSSZenGarden is a great site 
<http://www.csszengarden.com/>. They have a link that explains how they 
switch the stylesheets.If you are new to CSS, standards-based design, and this MSIE 
implementation problem, csszengarden is also a good site to visit. It 
shows you the power of predictable coding.
