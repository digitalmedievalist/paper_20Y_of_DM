This form is for proposals to run a course at FSCI 2018 at UCSD in La Jolla, =
California from July 30 to August 3, 2018. Please see the FSCI website www.fo=
rce11.org/fsci for more detail on how courses are structured and the expectat=
ions of instructors. We will work with shortlisted applications in January to=
 finalize the selection of courses. The final program will be announced in Fe=
bruary. Submission deadline: January 8, 2017New and returning instructors are welcome!About FSCI2018FSCI 2018 (FORCE11 Scholarly Communications Institute) is the premiere Commun=
ity-led and organised summer school on current trends in Scholarly Communicat=
ion.Instructors are community members who are passionate about passing on their k=
nowledge and experience to others in Scholarly Communication. They range from=
 up-and-coming researchers and practitioners to world-leading experts.The students they teach come from a wide variety of backgrounds: research, fu=
nding, administration, publishing, libraries, and information users. They ran=
ge from absolute beginners to discipline leaders. They are eager to learn and=
 represent an excellent source of potential collaborations!If you have ideas for a course that could help other members of the community=
 navigate this new world, then we want to hear from you!Course DescriptionFSCI has two types of course.=E2=80=A2         Morning courses (13-14 hours each), run Monday - Friday app=
roximately 09:00 - 12:30 with a coffee break each day.  Morning courses tend =
to contain more fundamental material or focus on broader areas of study. Exam=
ples from 2017 include =E2=80=9CReproducibility in Theory and Practice=E2=80=
=9D and =E2=80=9CInside Scholarly Communications Today=E2=80=9D.=E2=80=A2         Afternoon courses (6 hours each) run for three hours after =
lunch on Monday/Tuesday and on Wednesday/Thursday. (In response to feedback f=
rom FSCI 2017, afternoon course instructors will run their classes twice to m=
aximise availability).   Afternoon courses tend to be a bit more specialised =
and sometimes more technical. These are excellent places for advanced topics.In all cases, we encourage instructors to design their material around a hand=
s-on, workshop format. Student evaluations suggest that attendees want to try=
 things out for themselves and are less patient with a lecture-centered appro=
ach.You can see some of the titles we had last year below.How to Propose a CourseYou can propose a course using our Course Proposal Form. This form asks you f=
or a title, instructor(s), and some background on you and your proposed topic=
. A programming committee will review course proposals with the goal of choos=
ing the best combination of topics, skill-levels, and disciplinary focus.What Support Can I Expect?FSCI will provide basic technical support for instructors. If you have specia=
lised needs, we will do our best to arrange additional support. In addition, =
FSCI will provide complimentary tuition fees, housing, and meals for 1 instru=
ctor per course. We are currently unable to provide reimbursement for travel =
costs to and from San Diego, though we are seeking funding.  We hope to be ab=
le to secure some funding with a focus on providing support to instructors fr=
om Low and Mid Income Economies. Additional information about travel support =
will be posted as it becomes available.  If you do require travel funding to =
participate in FSCI, please indicate this on the submission form.Sample Courses from Previous Year=E2=80=A2 Altmetrics: Where Are We Now and Where Are We Headed Next?=E2=80=A2 Applying Design Thinking and User Research to the Scholarly Communi=
