The 3rd workshop on Structuring and Understanding of Multimedia heritAge Cont=
entsIn conjunction with ACM Multimedia 2021, 20 - 24 October 2020, Chengdu, ChinaWorkshop: https://sumac-workshops.github.io/2021/
Conference: https://2021.acmmm.orgAims and scopeThe digitization of large quantities of analogue data and the massive product=
ion of born-digital
documents for many years now provide us with large volumes of varied multimed=
ia data
(images, maps, text, video, multi-sensor data, etc.), an important feature of=
 which is that they
are cross-domain. "Cross-domain" reflects the fact that these data may have b=
een acquired
in very different conditions: different acquisition systems, times and points=
 of view. These
data represent an extremely rich heritage that can be exploited in a wide var=
iety of fields, from
Social Sciences and Humanities to land use and territorial policies, includin=
g smart city, urban
planning, smart tourism and culture, creative media and entertainment. In ter=
ms of research
in computer science, they address challenging problems related to the diversi=
ty and volume
of the media across time, the variety of content descriptors (potentially inc=
luding the time
dimension), the veracity of the data, and the different user needs with respe=
ct to engaging with
this rich material and the extraction of value out of the data. These challen=
ges are reflected
in various research topics such as multimodal and mixed media search, automat=
ic content
analysis, multimedia linking and recommendation, and big data analysis and vi=
sualization,
where scientific bottlenecks may be exacerbated by the time dimension, which =
also provides
topics of interest such as multimodal time series analysis.The objective of the third edition of this workshop is to present and discuss=
 the latest and
most significant trends in the analysis, structuring and understanding of mul=
timedia contents
dedicated to the valorization of heritage, with the emphasis on enabling acce=
ss to the big
data of the past. We welcome research contributions for the following (but no=
t limited to) topics:  *   Multimedia and cross-domain data interlinking and recommendation
  *   Dating and spatialization of historical data
  *   Mixed media data access and indexing
  *   Deep learning in adverse conditions (transfer learning, learning with s=
ide information,etc.)
  *   Multi-modal time series analysis, evolution modeling
  *   Multi-modal & multi-temporal data rendering
  *   Heritage - Building Information Modeling, Art
  *   HCI / Interfaces for large-scale datasets
  *   Smart digitization of massive quantities of data
  *   Bench-marking, Open Data Movement
  *   Generative modeling of cultural heritageImportant dates  *   Paper submission: 30 July 2021 (11:59 p.m. AoE)
  *   Author acceptance notification: 26 August 2021
  *   Camera-Ready: 2 September 2021
  *   Workshop date: 20 or 24 October 2021Keynote speakersJon Hardeberg (Professor at the Computer Science Department of the Norwegian =
University of Science and Technology, Norway): talk on Analyzing CHANGE in cu=
ltural heritage objects through images.
Mathieu Aubry (Senior researcher, Imagine team, LIGM lab, Ecole des Ponts Par=
isTech, France): talk on Deep Learning for Historical Data Analysis.Submission guidelinesSubmission format. All submissions must be original work not under review at =
any other
workshop, conference, or journal. The workshop will accept papers describing =
completed work
as well as work in progress. One submission format is accepted: full paper, w=
hich must follow
the formatting guidelines of the main conference ACM MM 2021. Full papers sho=
uld be from 6 to
8 pages (plus 2 additional pages for the references), encoded as PDF and usin=
g the ACM Article
Template. For paper guidelines, please visit: https://2021.acmmm.org/regular-=
papers .Peer Review and publication in ACM Digital Library. Paper submissions must co=
nform
with the =E2=80=9Cdouble-blind=E2=80=9D review policy. All papers will be pee=
r-reviewed by experts in the field,
they will receive at least two reviews. Acceptance will be based on relevance=
 to the workshop,
scientific novelty, and technical quality. Depending on the number, maturity =
and topics of the
accepted submissions, the work will be presented via oral or poster sessions.=
 The workshop
papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.OrganizersValerie Gouet-Brunet (LaSTIG Lab / IGN - Gustave Eiffel University, France)
