 a cosmopolitan flair.=20The University of Hamburg was founded in 1919. Today the Faculty of the Human=
ities is home to over 10,000 students. Since its inception Hamburg University=
 has maintained a strong focus on foreign languages and cultures. To foster a=
nd to explore such diversity is a key task of the Humanities - and to provide=
 theories, methods and tools to this end poses a particularly interesting cha=
llenge to the Digital Humanities. We hope you will join in the discussion on =
"Digital Diversity" at the DH2012 and look forward to seeing you in Hamburg!VI. International Program CommitteeSusan Brown (SDH-SEMI - Vice Chair)
