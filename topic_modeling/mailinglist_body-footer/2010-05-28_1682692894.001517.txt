EuroMed2010  - Call for Papers - New Deadlines  and Best Paper Awards
Dedicated to Digital Cultural Heritage and Digital LibrariesNovember 8 - 13th, 2010
Limassol, Cyprus
http://www.euromed2010.euInvitation:
You are kindly invited to submit a paper to the EUROMED2010 joint
conference which will provide an opportunity to exchange research
results, opinions, experiences and proposals on the best practice and
hi-tech tools from Information and Communications Technology to
document, archive, preserve, manage and communicate Cultural Heritage (CH).
The main goal of the event is not only to illustrate the programs underway
but also excellent work wherever it is located and however it is
supported, in order to promote a common approach to the tasks of e-
documentation of World Cultural Heritage. Furthermore, regional
capacities in the area of Cultural Heritage and IT will be facilitated
in advancing their know-how through the exchange of information and
generation of new ideas and cooperation's, where the world meets the
finger prints of several ancient civilizations on earth.To reach this ambitious goal the topics covered will include
experiences in the use of innovative recording technologies & methods
and how to take best advantage to integrate the results obtained to
build up new tools and/or experiences as well as improved
methodologies for documenting, managing and communicating CH.The EuroMed2010 joint event will focus on interdisciplinary and multi-
disciplinary research concerning both cutting edge Cultural Heritage
Informatics and use of technology for the representation,
documentation, preservation, archiving and communication of CH
knowledge. The scope includes standards, metadata and every phase of CH
information technology: initial data capture/digitization, information/data
processing, reconstruction, visualization and documentation as well as
dissemination of results to the scientific and cultural heritage
communities and to the general public (Multilingua, Multimedia Digital
Library). We are also interested in aspects of the wider legal,
IPR and ethical responsibilities of Cultural Heritage Informatics. Research
subjects parallel the interests of  CIPA, ISPRS and EuroMed
including culturally significant monuments, artefacts and sites as
well as the activities of museums, libraries, archives, and
organizations involved with their care.Topics:
