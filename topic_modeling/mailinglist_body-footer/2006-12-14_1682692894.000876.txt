In order to avoid confusion, here follows a revised call for examples:

School for Library, Archive, and Information Studies (SLAIS)=20

in the joint project "TEI by Example".Featuring freely available online tutorials walking individuals through=20
the different stages in marking up a document in TEI (Text Encoding=20
Initiative <http://www.tei-c.org>), these online tutorials will provide=20
examples for users of all levels. Examples will be provided of different=20
document types, with varying degrees in the granularity of markup, to=20
provide a useful teaching and reference aid for those involved in the=20
marking up of texts.Eight tutorial modules will address a wide range of issues in text=20
encoding with TEI:
1. Introduction to text encoding with TEI
2. The TEI header
3. Prose
4. Poetry
5. Drama
6. Manuscript Transcription
7. Scholarly Editing
8. Customizing TEI, ODD, RomaTo build as much as possible on available sources of existing practice=20
in the field and to be able to present a broad view on the wide variety=20

examples (either fragments or complete texts) that are applicable to any=20
of these subjects. Examples are preferably encoded as TEI P5 XML texts,=20
but also texts encoded in TEI P4 XML, other XML formats, or other=20
(documented) electronic formats are of interest. Even examples of=20
less-ideal encoding practices are welcome, since the idea of learning by=20
error is a valuable didactic principle. Please do provide some=20
indication of the errors or controversies in such examples when=20
appropriate. After selection and editing, the example fragments will be=20
incorporated in the freely available online deliverables, which will be=20
