actually originally built as a relational database, using Access  
indeed, and I believe that this is still what it is, at base.  The  
Scriptorium people were indeed heavily involved in the drafting of  
the XML manuscript descriptoin guidelines which first became the  
MASTER system, and now underlie the TEI guidelines.  It was one of  
their aims to be able to export data from their database into Master/ 
TEI XML, and possibly to import from Master/TEI into the database,  
but I am not sure how far they got with this. In any case, one should  
distinguish their arrangement from that now used by quite a few  
database systems now available (mostly proprietary and very very  
expensive), which can read XML schemas, configure a database  
accordingly, and then automatically import data direct from the XML  
into the database.
One such system, which seems very powerful, is free, and has been  
used with some success by some people at least, is eXist (http:// 
exist.sourceforge.net/): very powerful, very configurable.  I don't  
know of an implementation of EXIST for Master/TEI encoded manuscript  
descriptions but this would surely be possible.  One system which was  
built specifically for MASTER records was the PHELIX system, built at  
Oxford for the MASTER project.  This had some very neat features  
indeed -- where is it now?
And, of course, I have to mention the Anastasia implementations of  
XML-encoded manuscript descriptions.  The original MASTER catalogue  
is not now functioning.  But there is a quite wonderful early print  
book (not manuscript! -- but the encodings work just fine, it seems)  
database of books printed in or about Japan c.1550-1650 at http:// 
133.12.23.145:8080/html/.  This features, among many amazing things,  
some very clever cross-language searching -- choose 'place name' in  
the search menu and look for 'Kyoto' and it will find you Kyoto in  
Japanese! It also has many images, and lots of other fine things.
If you are looking for an XML online catalogue of manuscripts: Wendy  
Scase's West Midland Manuscripts project is also  coming your way,  
again, done with Anastasia.  This is http://www.sd-editions.com/ 
AnaServer?MWM+0+start.anv.  This website is currently being updated  
and should look much nicer in a few days.  But what is here, gives  
some idea of what can be doneall the best

***original messageDear all,Does anybody know about electronic manuscript projects which are
using/have used relational databases following the TEI guidelines for
'Manuscript description'?Scriptorium seems to have done it, any other similar project? If so, do
you know of any related publication?I'd be very grateful for any advice, pitfall etc.Best wishes,OriettaDr Orietta Da Rold
