scripts of the type being discussed here. What the "Find Glyph" installer 
is doing is entirely normal practice; in fact, it is more polite than many 
in warning you that it is going to install "system" files. Most major 
software packages (virtually everything from Microsoft, for example) 
install numerous "system" files without your knowledge. These are normally 
"Dynamic Link Library" (DLL) files, which are standard libraries of 
routines used by several programs. If a DLL file required by the program 
you are installing is not already on your computer, the installer script 
will put it there for you, since the program won't run without it. The 
presence or absence of the DLL file is not necessarily related to what 
version of Windows you have; you could have the most recent version and 
still be missing DLL files required by some programs.DLL files are not always "operating system" files (most, in fact, are not), 
and installing one that is not yet on your computer is not "modifying the 
operating system." A new DLL file will not harm your system. However, 
problems can arise when a badly-written installer script replaces a DLL 
that already exists on your system (there are rules about when an installer 
script is allowed to do this, but sloppy programmers ignore rules). In this 
case you could end up with an older version of the file, or a version not 
intended for your configuration; if this happens, the new program may run 
just fine, but all the other programs that depended on the replaced DLL 
file may no longer work. (This problem is known to Windows programmers as 
"DLL Hell".)You should never install a program obtained from a source you do not trust. 
If you trust the source, or others you trust verify the integrity of the 
program, you can install it without worry. You should, of course, scan 
every downloaded file for viruses.I have examined the files that "Find Glyph" installs; they are all standard 
Microsoft files required by programs created with Microsoft Visual Basic. 
If they are not already on your system, it is only because you have not 
previously installed this type of program. In my opinion, it is safe to 
install Find Glyph.I would be willing to examine other "suspect" programs and report to the 
list. Perhaps we could create a set of links to "verified" programs that 
are of use to digital medievalists.David
