that the SLR camera on offer, Canon PowerShot G11, did not have the option
of remote operating through a computer.  This option was dropped (perhaps
to be reserved for more expensive models).The model you can control through a computer, and which downloads the
pictures directly to the hard disk, is the older (and therefore cheaper)
CANON EOS 1000D. We bought this, and it really works.But anyone preparing to make photos in this way should consult a decent
dealer or a photographer, and the internet. It's worth it --- you learn
much in the process.This obviously calls for a "best practice" guide somewhere...Neven
