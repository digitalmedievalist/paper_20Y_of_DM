suitable for such a project. There's also Philologic, if you have a  
collection of texts that you want to search.I sometimes muse about starting a database that would list all known  
Latin authors with available and ongoing editions to function as a  
starting-point for work on that text: basically, an expanded, editable  
version of Sharpe's Latin Writers. For something like this, I imagine  
that one could even use something like MediaWiki, though its format  
would not necessarily be ideal, and such undertakings need a solid  
base of usable data in order to get off the ground.Best of luck with your project: I'll be very interested to see the  
result (especially if that individual author happens to be Robert  
Grosseteste).Andrew Dunning
