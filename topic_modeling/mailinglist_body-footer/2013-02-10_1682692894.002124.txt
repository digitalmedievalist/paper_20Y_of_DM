Environment?Diplomatics has changed fundamentally in the last few decades due to 
dramatic developments in information technology. While consolidating 
itself as an autonomous science with its own centuries-old theory, 
methodology, analytical processes and tools, focused on research on 
medieval and early modern legal documents, it has also grown into an 
interdisciplinary field, expanding its area of inquiry to all kinds of 
textual traditions, documentary forms and creation processes through the 
use of sophisticated digital tools. "We shape our tools, and then our 
tools shape us", said Marshal McLuhan.Following the two conferences on Digital Diplomatics that took place in 
2007 in Munich and 2011 in Naples, this conference, to be held in Paris, 
14-16th november 2013, has the goal to further the scholarly reflection 
on the way in which diplomatics has developed as a result of both the 
opportunities offered by digital tools to study historical documents and 
the challenges presented by born digital documents and by the need to 
understand their structure and of the complex digital environments in 
which they reside.
