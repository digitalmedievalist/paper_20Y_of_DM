Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitWhat I Learned from This Exchange:1. XSLT is able to rearrange the hierarchy of an XML document using 
"milestone" elements. This was the original question, and I think it has 
been answered sufficiently, even if some of the fine points have not 
been worked out.2. A major limitation of XSLT is that it builds a document tree in 
memory. This limits its usefulness in working with very large files.3. Workarounds using XSLT are possible (e.g. file-splitting), but it may 
make more sense to use another tool.4. Anastasia appears to be a very good approach to the problem. I have 
poked around in it now (it's true that I hadn't before), and it seems 
commendable in its use of existing, stable tools and standards as well 
as its sensible approach to the problem of handling large textbases.5. Never get into an on-line discussion with two other guys named Peter, 
even if a James is there to help out.Peter Baker--===============9027937176306380177==--
