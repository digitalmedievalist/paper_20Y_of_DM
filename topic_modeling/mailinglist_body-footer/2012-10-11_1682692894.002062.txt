Call for Submissions, 2014 and 2015 Open Issues
Digital Philology is a new peer-reviewed journal devoted to the study of
medieval vernacular texts and cultures. Founded by Stephen G. Nichols and
Nadia R. Altschul, the journal aims to foster scholarship that crosses
disciplines upsetting traditional fields of study, national boundaries and
periodizations. Digital Philology also encourages both applied and
theoretical research that engages with the digital humanities and shows why
and how digital resources require new questions, new approaches, and yield
radical results. The Johns Hopkins University Press publishes two issues of
Digital Philology per year. One is open to all submissions, while the other
one is guest-edited, and revolves around a thematic axis.
Contributions may take the form of a scholarly essay or focus on the study
of a particular manuscript. Articles must be written in English, follow the
3rd edition (2008) of the MLA style manual, and be between 5,000 and 7,000
words in length, including footnotes and list of works cited. Quotations in
the main text in languages other than English should appear along with their
English translation. 
Digital Philology is welcoming submissions for its 2014 and 2015 open
issues. Inquiries and submissions (as a Word document attachment) should be
sent to dph(a)jhu.edu, addressed to the Managing Editor (Albert Lloret).
Digital Philology also publishes manuscript studies and reviews of books and
digital projects. Correspondence regarding manuscript studies may be
addressed to Jeanette Patterson at jlp4(a)princeton.edu. Correspondence
regarding digital projects and publications for review may be addressed to
Timothy Stinson at tlstinson(a)gmail.com. [http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/digital_philology/index.html]  Editors and Editorial Board
