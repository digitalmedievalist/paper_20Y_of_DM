paper, guidelines, project reports, etc. Something I'd like to see is a 
version of Jim Marchand's What Every Medievalist Should Know (WEMSK) on 
medtext for scholars working with digital media. Obviously "a primer for 
working with computers" is too broad; but perhaps some kind of topic by 
topic discussion of important issues one should know about.Does anybody know of a good community-focussed digital primer that might 
serve as a model (e.g. perhaps aimed at teachers or some similar group)? 
This idea is still in its early stages. My preference would be for 
something developed through the community as a whole.-dan--
