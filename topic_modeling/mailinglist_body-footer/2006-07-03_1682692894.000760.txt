Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitWorkshop on Historical Text MiningThursday 20th and Friday 21st July 2006, Lancaster University, UK. http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/events/htm06/Organisers: Paul Rayson (Lancaster University) and Dawn Archer
(University of Central Lancashire) This is one of a series of workshops sponsored by the AHRC ICT Methods
Network. We want to develop a network of scholars interested in 'Historical Text
Mining' via a workshop for experts from the various fields: text mining
and E-Science, corpus development and annotation, historical
linguistics, dialectology and computational linguistics. We believe that
a discussion relating to the effective text mining of historical data is
particularly overdue and much needed, because of the growth in
(historical) digital resources (e.g. Open Content Alliance, Google
Print, Early English Books Online). We particularly want to better
define the relationship between the text mining/E-Science community, who
are often involved in applying basic techniques to large scale datasets,
and the corpus linguistic community, who tend to apply data-driven
linguistic analysis and annotation techniques to relatively small
datasets. The 'Historical Text Mining' workshop will seek: * to raise awareness of the various techniques utilised and/or tools
developed by researchers working within the various fields. 
* to make scholars who work with historical data aware of existing text
mining techniques that are applicable to their research needs, 
* to familiarise such scholars with the use of these techniques and
tools, by means of a series of tutorial sessions (e.g. GATE, WordSmith,
VARD, VIEW, Wmatrix), 
* to investigate the problems of applying some "modern" large-scale
corpus annotation and analysis techniques to historical data, and 
* to encourage/enable a roundtable discussion, with the ultimate aim of
determining what needs to be done to improve historical text mining and
(importantly) identify possible future workshops and collaborative
projects.Participation is free but, since places are limited, we request that
potential participants apply in advance, and explain why they wish to
attend and what they expect from the workshop. For further details on
the application procedure and the workshop programme, please see the
