Dear list members,
With apologies for cross-posting:Perhaps some of you or your contacts might be interested in the following job=
 opening in the ERC Consolidator Grant-funded Dissident Networks Project (DIS=
SINET, https://dissinet.cz), where we use computational methods to shed new l=
ight on medieval religious dissidence and inquisition. I am now searching for=
 a computational linguist or NLP specialist to join the adventure - please se=
e below.
All the best,David Zb=C3=ADralNumber of open positions: 1Expected start: 1 September 2021 (negotiable)Duration: 31 August 2022 (first contract), 31 August 2026 (very probable exte=
nsion based on performance review)Deadline for applications: 30 April 2021 23:59 CEST (UTC+2)Full call and submission: https://www.muni.cz/en/about-us/careers/vacancies/6=
0994
The Dissident Networks Project (DISSINET, https://dissinet.cz/) - an ERC Cons=
olidator Grant-funded research initiative based at Masaryk University (Brno, =
Czech Republic) - offers a full-time postdoctoral or senior research fellowsh=
ip in computational text analysis. The research of the successful applicant w=
ill focus on discursive patterns in medieval inquisitorial records, with the =
aim of shining a new light on the textual practices of inquisition notaries, =
the interaction at trial, the discourse of inquisition texts, and religious d=
issidence.
We are searching for a research fellow with one of the following types of pro=
file:(a) computational linguist, NLP specialist or text mining specialist, with a =
strong interest in history and ancient languages;(b) digital humanist, with a strong competence in Latin and experienced in hi=
storical research, programming, and the analysis of textual corpora; or(c) another kind of mixed/interdisciplinary profile, with some of the previou=
sly mentioned competencies and strong interest in working on a historical res=
earch project.
The successful candidate will develop their own research direction in consult=
ation with the Principal Investigator (Dr David Zb=C3=ADral), focusing on the=
 computational text processing and analysis of medieval inquisitorial records=
, e.g. building and maintaining NLP pipeline, stylometric and semantic analys=
is (word frequency and word co-occurrence, word embeddings, lexical dispersio=
n, measures of lexical richness, measures of distance of texts, text reuse an=
alysis, semantic distribution models) etc. DISSINET at large also works exten=
sively on the manual coding of inquisitorial material, offering a close-readi=
ng layer to be compared and contrasted with the distant-reading analysis of t=
he textual corpus provided by NLP techniques.
DISSINET focuses on various computational approaches to Christian dissent and=
 inquisition, also including social network analysis, geographic information =
science, and other techniques: the successful candidate will have the opportu=
nity to produce mixed-methodology work in this collaborative context. The ERC=
-funded position thus represents a unique opportunity for building a truly cu=
tting-edge research profile.
The position is residential (although with reasonable flexibility for the dur=
ation of the pandemic). We are open to applications from those who have alrea=
dy completed their doctorates, and those who have submitted their thesis and =
are only awaiting the award of their degree. The candidate's Ph.D. de=
gree does not need to be recent for this position. Applications from female c=
andidates are particularly encouraged.
Please see https://www.muni.cz/en/about-us/careers/vacancies/60994 for more i=
nformation.
