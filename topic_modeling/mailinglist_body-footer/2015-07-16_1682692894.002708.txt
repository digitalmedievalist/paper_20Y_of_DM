 inquisitions post mortem (IPMs), currently covering the period 1418-1447.
IPMs recorded the lands held at their deaths by tenants of the crown, and are=
 the single most important source for the study of landed society in medieval=
 England. Describing the lands held by thousands of families, from nobles to =peasants, they are a key source for the history of almost every=20
parish in England and many in Wales.Please explore at:
www.inquisitionspostmortem.ac.ukBest wishes,
Matthew Holford
