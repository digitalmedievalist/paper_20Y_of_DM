ies aims to bring together scholarship from around the world and across disci=
plines related to the study of pre-modern manuscript books and documents. Thi=
s peer-reviewed journal is open to contributions that rely on both traditiona=
l methodologies of manuscript study and those that explore the potential of n=
ew ones. We publish articles that engage in a larger conversation on manuscri=
pt culture and its continued relevance in today's world and highlight the val=
ue of manuscript evidence in understanding our shared cultural and intellectu=
al heritage. Studies that incorporate digital methodologies to further unders=
tanding of the physical and conceptual structures of the manuscript book are =
encouraged. A separate section, entitled Annotations, features research in pr=
ogress and digital project reports.The editors are now accepting submissions for the Fall 2017 issue. To submit,=
 please send a cover page with your name and contact info, the title of the s=
ubmission and a short abstract along with your submission to sims-mss(a)pobox=
