find of interest:The TEUCHOS centre <http://www.teuchos.uni-hamburg.de/>  - an institution
that aims to provide digital research infrastructure in the fields of
scholarly editing, paleography, manuscript research and history of philology
and is located at the University of Hamburg - organized between 20 and 22
January a conference with the title Digital Philology -
<http://www.teuchos.uni-hamburg.de/?page_id=34>  Problems and Perspectives.
The presentations focused on tools, imaging, resources, cataloguing, and
editing, and was preceded by a workshop on the digital edition of letter
corpora. It did indeed provide a good overview over the state of digital
editing and the tools and technologies necessary to produce these - both
their achievements and problems. Some of the issues that came up during the
conference were:*	the legal situation created by current copyright laws
*	the relation of the digital research environment to traditional
research discourses
*	the need for broader agreement on issues of standards and unique
identifiers
*	the development of new protocols in referring to digital products
*	the availability of digital editions and the tools to produce themAnother aspect was the conversations and the networking facilitated between
work in different projects, countries, and languages: not only between
projects mostly in German, English, French, or Italian, but also several
Russian projects.The conference organizers will no doubt wish to share more information about
both the conference and the TEUCHOS project as whole in time. It is very
much hoped that the TEUCHOS centre succeed in obtaining the necessary
funding to begin such important work in Germany in a truly international and
collaborative spirit.Best, Juan ----------------------------------------------------------------------------Dr Juan GarcésCentre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College LondonKay House, 7 Arundel StreetLondon WC2R 3DXT: +44 (0)20 7848 1393F: +44 (0)20 7848 2980
