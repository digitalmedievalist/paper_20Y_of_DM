project 'A Partial Survey of Continental Scribal Centres Writing Caroline
Minuscule, c. 700 â€“ 1000', run by the Network for the Study of Caroline
Minuscule (NSCM), at http://litteracarolina.upenndigitalscholarship.org/
survey-project/scribal-centres
<http://litteracarolina.upenndigitalscholarship.org>. The article on
Werden, by Max Schmitz, is now available to download under a CC BY-NC-CA
license. It brings together a full list of the fragments and manuscripts
written in Caroline minuscule associated with the scribal centre at Werden
to c. 1000, all searchable on our online database, making it a valuable
resource. A full introduction to the project is also downloadable; it is
recommended that you read this first, as it contains important information
about the structure of the articles.Forthcoming articles will cover Freising, Metz and Lorsch. Several scribal
centres are still unassigned, and expressions of interest for these are
welcome; please visit the website for more details.Our grateful thanks go to APICES for the J.M.M. Hermans grant, which funded
this project.In addition to the survey project, the NSCM website now offers a brief
guide to Caroline minuscule script, as well as a blog series on European
research libraries, written as a guide to visiting and working in these
libraries by researchers who have travelled there in person. These may be
of particular interest to students and early-career scholars.Best wishes,Anna Dorofeeva
