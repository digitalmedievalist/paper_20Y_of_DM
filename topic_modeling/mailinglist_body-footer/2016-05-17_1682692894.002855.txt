this is a reminder that the deadline for the AIUCD 2016 conference is 
getting closer (May 31), anybody interested is invited to submit an 
abstract.R---------------------------------------------------------------------Digital editions: representation, interoperability, text analysis and 
infrastructures	Fifth AIUCD Annual Conference
	7-9 settembre 2016
	Aula Magna S. Trentin, Caâ€™ Dolfin, Dorsoduro 3825/e - 30123 Venezia                        CALL FOR PAPERS AND POSTERS[Full announcement available on: http://www.aiucd2016.unive.it/]The AIUCD 2016 conference is devoted to the representation and study of 
the text under different points of view (resources, analysis, 
infrastructures), in order to bring together philologists, historians, 
digital humanists, computational linguists, logicians, computer 
scientists and software engineers and discuss about the text.It is time for research infrastructures to be able to guarantee 
interoperability and integration between the instruments for 
philological studies and the instruments for the analysis of large 
textual corpora, breaking down the rigid barriers between digital and 
computational philology on the one hand, and corpus linguistics on the 
other hand.As a consequence, without ruling out other possible topics belonging to 
the Digital Humanities area, we solicit your contributions (talks and 
posters) on these topics:_Representation and Interoperability_   * Which digital representation models prove most effective for 
overcoming the dichotomy between diplomatic and critical editions?
   * How to integrate multimedia products (such as 2D images, 3D models, 
audio, video) in the digital edition?
   * How to apply the methods of digital philology to multimedia 
products (such as film quotations, restored versions, musical 
variations, etc.)?
   * How to build a constructive dialogue between traditional 
philologists and digital philologists?_Text Analysis and Digital Objects Processing_   * Which extensions are needed, in order to apply the methods of 
computational linguistics to the study of variants?
   * How to create linguistic and textual analysis chains starting from 
texts that present variants?
   * How can computational linguistic tools be used to bring out regions 
of interest in large amounts of text on which to focus the attention?
   * What is the state of art for the analysis of digital objects?
   * How to assess the quality of analyses produce by means of the 
crowdsourcing method?_Infrastructures_What can research infrastructures offer for the management of digital 
editions?
How to conduct a study of requirements for infrastructures so that they 
are increasingly accessible to both digital humanists and traditional 
philologists?
How can Digital humanities scholars be put in contact with the community 
of traditional scholars?_Communities and Collaboration_   * Which benefits do the interaction and the involvement of teachers, 
high school and university students in digital editions projects bring 
to research activities?
   * How can digital libraries collaborate to create, access, share and 
reuse digital resources?
   * How may teachers and students get interested in the dissemination 
of research results?
   * How do digital libraries contribute to the dissemination of 
research results?
   * How to prepare a shared syllabus, in order to train digital 
humanists to become aware of aware of the problems and potentialities of 
digital editions?
   * Which are the best practices to enroll a broader audience in the 
use of digital editions?*Abstract submission*The contributions (talks and posters), to be proposed in the form of an 
abstract of 1000 words maximum, in PDF format, must be loaded through 
the EasyChair Web site at this URL: 
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiucd2016. Abstracts will be 
accepted in Italian or in English.The deadline for submission of abstracts to the Programme Committee is 
scheduled for midnight on May 31, 2016. Information on the acceptance 
will be communicated to the authors by June 30, 2016.*Abstract preparation and evaluation*The abstract should describe the objectives of the contribution, a brief 
reference to the state of the art, the methodology adopted, and - if 
possible - the results achieved or expected. It should also contain a 
bibliography.The call for papers welcome three types of contributions: (1) full 
paper, mainly to discuss innovative methodologies; (2) short paper, 
mainly to present accomplished research outputs; (3) poster, mainly to 
present early and innovative work in progress.The conference proposals will be selected through peer-reviewing by at 
least two Italian and/or foreign scholars expert in the fields of 
(Digital) Humanities and/or Computer Science.At the end of the evaluation process, the Scientific Committee may 
decide to move an accepted proposal to a different category.*Instructions for talks*Full papers will last 30 minutes (20-25 min + 5-10 min for questions). 
Short papers will last 20 minutes (15 min + 5 min for questions). The 
conference room is equipped with a computer, a projector, and internet 
connection.*Instructions for posters*Poster will be accepted in Italian or in English:   * The best configuration of your poster is A1 vertical (841mm x 594mm).
   * Posters will be displayed in a dedicated space at the Conference 
venue. Display panels will be provided. Please bring your printed poster 
as we are unable to provide printing service.
   * Display panels for posters will be ready by Wednesday, 7th 
September 2016 at 10:00 am and all posters should be put up before 2:00 pm.
   * Personal laptop computers may be used at the poster display area. 
Should your presentation include a laptop, please inform the organizing 
committee on acceptance of your proposal.
   * Specific sessions will be scheduled in the conference programme for 
authors to provide the audience with a quick intro (max 2 minutes) to 
their poster.Further information will be progressively published on the conference 
site: http://www.aiucd2016.unive.it/.R-- Roberto Rosselli Del Turco   roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
