experimenting with cocoon, which of course is excellent at doing things=20
like remapping xml files so that users think they are reading a file in=20
html, and the like. The Digital Medievalist site is in fact produced=20
using cocoon which transforms the underlying xml.What I need to be able to do is use passwords to protect this site. I've=20
read up on cocoon's authentication model, including the sample code. But=20
they don't give examples with kind of authentication backend I'm most=20
familiar with .htpasswd (or any at all, really).Does anybody have experience with cocoon's authentication, particularly=20
using an easy-to-set-up authentication backend (and even better=20
.htpasswd)? I appreciate any suggestions, especially since, as this=20
project is in pre-funding mode, I'll have to learn any system proposed=20
rather than having the money to hire somebody who knows what they are doing.-dan--=20
