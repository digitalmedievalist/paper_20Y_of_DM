deadline for applications March 17, 2014.I have spoken to the chair and am told that an interest in DH and/or 
Medieval Studies would be welcome. The core requirements are 
skill/experience in teaching second language learners, especially at the 
junior level, and demonstrable interest in and ability to teach French 
Phonology/Phonetics. Beyond that the research expertise is open.Canadian residents must be given preference according to the law, though 
international candidates will be considered. The ad says that "there 
will be internal candidates for the position," but I have just spoken to 
the chair and she tells me that that language was inserted by mistake by 
Human Resources after proofing and will be removed ASAP (the ad just 
went up at the end of the business day). She assures me that this is 
very much an open search and that all qualified applicants, including 
international candidates, will be considered seriously.For my own part, let me add that candidates with a background in DH will 
find the University of Lethbridge to be very active in the field. We are 
in the process of approving research centres in the Digital Arts and 
Humanities and Digital Scholarly Communication and the University of 
Lethbridge is host to both Digital Medievalist and GlobaloutlookDH.org. 
I would certainly look forward to working with a successful candidate 
with Digital Humanities experience. I should stress, however, that I 
have no influence on the search.-dan------------------The Department of Modern Languages at the University of Lethbridge

teaching intermediate French phonetics/phonology, French language and 
culture courses at all levels, as well as upper-level courses in the 
field of expertise. We seek an individual with native or near-native
