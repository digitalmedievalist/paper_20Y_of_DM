JEAN BAPTISTE CAMPSI started my training in digital medieval scholarship with an MA in
`Digital Technologies applied to History’ at the École des chartes in
2006-2008, with a thesis on the quantitative study of Troubadour
Manuscripts. After working as a library curator, I did my PhD (Univ.
Paris-Sorbonne) on the edition of the `Chanson d’Otinel’, with the aim to
develop models to closely integrate ecdotics with digital methods
(modelling, statistics, algorithmics and artificial intelligence), both for
data production and analysis.I have been the course leader of the Master’s degree `Digital Technologies
applied to History’ (2013-2017), and now supervise the new ‘Digital
Humanities and Research’ (PSL Research University) Master’s programme. I
teach Digital Scholarly Editing, XSLT and Quantitative Philology. My main
research interests are in digital philology, text and data mining
(stylometry, stemmatology, quantitative palaeography and codicology) and
ecdotics for Old French and Old Occitan texts and manuscripts.
LISA FAGIN DAVISLisa Fagin Davis (Medieval Studies PhD, Yale University, 1993) has been
Executive Director of the Medieval Academy of America since 2013.

metadata standards for manuscript cataloguing. She serves on the Advisory
Committees for Digital Scriptorium, the Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript
Studies, and Fragmentarium, and is deeply engaged in using and promoting
both Mirador and IIIF. Publications include: the Beinecke Library Catalogue
of Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts, Vol. IV; The Gottschalk
Antiphonary; the Directory of Pre-1600 Manuscripts in the United States and
Canada (with Melissa Conway); numerous articles in the fields of manuscript
studies and codicology; La Chronique Anonyme Universelle: Reading and
Writing History in fifteenth-century France (a critical edition that
includes a digital resource developed in collaboration with the Digital
Mappaemundi project); and the Manuscript Road Trip blog. She regularly
teaches an introduction to manuscript studies at the Simmons Graduate
School of Library and Information Science.
GRETA FRANZINI –STANDS FOR RE-ELECTION–Greta Franzini is a Classicist by training and currently conducts
interdisciplinary research in Digital Classics, Digital Scholarly Editing
and Natural Language Processing. Greta works as an early career researcher
at the University of Goettingen for the Electronic Text Reuse Acquisition
project, and, together with the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities,
jointly maintains the Catalogue of Digital Editions.Greta has served on the Digital Medievalist Executive and Journal Boards
since 2015. In the past two years, Greta has modernised and maintained the
Digital Medievalist website; she has managed the Digital Medievalist
Facebook and Twitter accounts; she has helped secure reviews and has worked
as an Associate Editor for the Digital Medievalist Journal; and finally,
she has sought volunteers to help translate the Digital Medievalist
Wikipedia page into multiple languages in order to increase outreach. Greta
would like to continue working in this capacity and thus stands for
re-election.
ROBERTO DEL MONTEI have a Master’s degree in History of Medieval Art, obtained in 2013 at
the University of Florence, Italy. For the past two years, I have been
leading the NUME International Research Group, developing a digital network
of scholars around the world, coordinating the organization of conferences
on medieval studies, the publication of specialist studies, the creation of
interdisciplinary events and digital projects (e.g. the 3D reconstruction
of some Italian churches hit by an earthquake in 2016). I have published
articles on History of Medieval Art in Italy and France, worked with
scientific journals and attended international conferences. I have
experience in networking management, editing and managing digital content:
I would like to run for the Journal Associate Editor, News Feed
Administrator or Facebook Administrator positions.
ELS DE PAERMENTIER –STANDS FOR RE-ELECTION–Els De Paermentier is Assistant Professor in Medieval Diplomatics and
Palaeography at Ghent University (Belgium). In 2010 she completed her PhD
on the organisation of the comital chancery in the counties of Flanders and
Hainaut (1191-1244). For her research she elaborated a computer-aided
methodology to determine the editorial origin of charter texts. In 2012 she
received a COST Action grant for a short term scientific mission at the
Institut de Recherche et d’Histoire des Textes (IRHT) in Paris, where she
examined the interoperability possibilities between the Belgian and French
Latin source databases Diplomata Belgica and TELMA-databases (Traitement
Électronique des Manuscrits et des Archives). Shortly afterwards she became
a member of the COST Action Program IS1005: Medieval Europe – Medieval
Cultures and Technological Resources, and joined the working group for the
design of a virtual centre for medieval studies (VCMS) (2012-2015).
Currently, she is a member of the advisory board of the online charter
database Diplomata Belgica: The Diplomatic Sources from the Medieval
Southern Low Countries and of the steering committee of the Ghent Centre

Centre of Excellence for the study of the History of Emotion and winner of
the Faculty Prize for Excellence in Teaching. Her first monograph, In
Enigmate: the history of a riddle from 400-1500, is forthcoming from Four
Courts Press. After her PhD, she worked on two DH post-docs, The Psalms in
Trinity at the Old Library at Trinity College Dublin, and The Psalms In
Ireland Before 1600 based at Archbishop Marshes Library in Dublin.  The aim
of these projects was to provide context for the Faddan More Psalter (which
had recently been discovered) by cataloguing and digitizing pre-modern
psalmic material and providing a searchable database of psalmic marginalia.
ENGIN CIHAD TEKINEngin is working as academic advisor for a number of TUBİTAK’s (The

as the Turkish representative for the Azerbaijani Institute of Manuscripts
between 2010-2013. He is also working for his own Project- readment.com
Structured Digital library Project.
HEATHER WACHAAs a CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow in Data Curation for Medieval Studies, I
would be delighted to serve on the Digital Medievalist Executive Board. My
interest and passion for the digital humanities began while I was working
on my doctorate, when a GIS class showed me how to ask new research
questions of my 13th-century sources. I was also interested in
disseminating public history projects via digital media and decided to
create a set of educational videos about medieval manuscripts.  Since then
I have taken on the digital edition of a 13th-century cartulary from
northern France using TEI encoding, the editing of nine mappamundi in
Digital Maxima, a software environment developed by Martin Foys, professor
of English at the University of Wisconsin, and the use of social network
analysis for visualizing the relationships between mappamundi and their
textual sources. For medievalists, it is crucial we continue to recognize
the benefits of using digital technologies in our discipline and I see my
present and future careers helping myself and others put these technologies
into practice.--
