Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableI have some experience in building communities, and I'd say that you=20
should always see the mailing list as core. This is because it pushes=20
information out, but also because it serves as a locus of identity:=20
while people complain about list traffic if it gets too high, they=20
nevertheless do tend to subscribe. Lists like dm-l and globaloutlookdh-l=20
even have people who subscribe and then set themselves to no mail!In a modern community, I think you want to supplement the list with some=20
other things and try, as much as possible, to see the different channels=20
as different portals into roughly the same information set:* You need a twitter feed, since many people follow things that way;
* You should have a blog for larger items; personally, I'd try to=20
encourage people to contribute guest postings to it, but I've found that=20
hard. I've wondered about somehow using syndication capabilities as a=20
way of capturing content.
* You want a news service for community announcements--that does tend to=20
get used if you promote it.
* I'm less convinced that wikis work that well for most communities.Ideally, all should be integrated: so blog posts should be announced on=20
twitter and the mailing list; announcements should go to the mailing=20
list and twitter and show up on the blog (maybe in a sidebar); I wonder=20
if it wouldn't make sense to somehow capture the list traffic on the=20
blog as well: perhaps by adding a page that includes the archive or=20
posting a digest each day as a posting. But I've not worked out any good=20
ideas on how to do that.-danOn 13-06-11 12:42 PM, Carl Edlund Anderson wrote:
