Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitThe task Martin wants to perform is exactly the kind of thing that XSLT 
is good at and could do easily.I also see Peter's point, echoed here. Until we have a markup language 
that handles overlapping hierarchies natively, all proposed solutions 
will be annoying in some way. Still, I have a higher opinion of the 
abilities of XSLT than Peter does (I've been using it in font 
development, of all things, so I look at it as pretty flexible), and 
I'll bet it could handle the XML workarounds for overlapping hierarchies 
such as the one proposed in the paper by Alexander Czmiel linked to by 
James Cummings.But if a thing has got to perform fast, it might be best to use the XSLT 
to create static pages or a database, or turn data from a database into 
pages, rather than have it dynamically create pages from a large 
underlying text.Peter BakerMartin K. Foys wrote:>> At 08:49 AM 23/06/2004, Peter Robinson wrote:
