positions to its Executive Board. Board positions are for two year terms
and incumbents may be re-elected (for a maximum of three terms in a row).
Members of the Board are responsible for the overall direction of the
organisation and leading the Digital Medievalist's many projects and
programmes. This is a working board, and so it would be expected that you
are willing and able to commit a little bit of time to helping Digital
Medievalist undertake some of its activities
(such as helping to run its its journal, conference sessions, etc.). For
further information about the Executive and Digital Medievalist more
generally please see the DM website, particularly:-  http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/about.html
-  http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/bylaws.htmlWe are now seeking nominations (including self-nominations) for the annual
elections. In order to be eligible for election, candidates must be members
of Digital Medievalist (membership is conferred simply by subscription to
the organisation's mailing list, dm-l) and have made some demonstrable
contribution either to the DM project (e.g. to the mailing list, or the
wiki, etc.), or generally to the field of digital medieval studies.If you are interested in running for these positions or are able to
recommend a suitable candidate, please contact the returning officers,
Orietta Da Rold (odr1(a)leicester.ac.uk) and Takako Kato (T
akakoKato123(a)gmail.com <takako.kato(a)gmail.com>) who will treat your
nomination or enquiries in confidence. The nomination period will close at
0000 UTC on Tuesday June 19 and elections will be held by electronic ballot
through the whole of the week starting  28 June, 2013.Best wishes,Orietta and Takako--===============0835531147090910903==
