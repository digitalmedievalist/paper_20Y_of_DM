publishers ask for their books. The problem is that they won't bother
cutting down their prices as long as libraries will happily buy their
overpriced publications. There's no easy solution, of course. Authors prefer
to have their books published, no matter at what price. Libraries are
(unfortunately) totally unable to negociate the prices other than not
buying, but this has no consequence upon the publishers' price policies.
Moreover, the publisher's greed oblige them to spend vast sums of money
(which generally came from public funds) to acquire a few books. And
scholars and students who can't afford the books are but forced to rely on
their library to buy it. I do agree with Klaus that what is wrong is this
"laisser faire" attitude of counting on libraries to dilapidate public money
on overpriced books.I have no solution to propose but we should seek to find new ways to publish
scholarly works and make them generally available to the public. There's are
electronic forms of publications but there also are some publishers who sell
their books at decent prices. Why not trade a bit of "prestige" for easier
and wider access?LB on 25/6/04 2:34 AM, Norman Hinton at hinton(a)springnet1.com wrote:> Let's see -- if I can't afford it. it's also wrong to have my library
