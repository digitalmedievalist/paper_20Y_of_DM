Digital Medievalist Elections 2010, and I would also like to encourage
you to vote in the elections. Digital Medievalist as a project and
community of practice has grown steadily over the last few years and
most of this is down to the hard work put in by the DM Board. The DM
Board does more than merely oversee Digital Medievalist, it is a
working board and all board members have contributed their time and
energy, whether it is in copy-editing journal articles, arranging
conference sessions, moderating news posts, or any other range of
activities.  It has been my pleasure to be Director of Digital
Medievalist for the last year and we've undertaken some significant
improvements to the way it works and hopefully it will continue to
thrive in the future.I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the current and
previous DM Board members for their hard work, enthusiasm, and
commitment to Digital Medievalist. I would especially like to thank
those DM Board members who have chosen not to stand again this year,
Roberto Rosselli Del Turco and Dorothy Carr Porter, for their generous
work over many years and hope that they will continue to be active DM
volunteers. Marjorie Burghart and myself have chosen to add our names
again to the very strong ballot of candidates up for election.Digital Medievalist is made up of all of the people who are part of
this community: Digital Medievalist is not just the DM Board, but all
of us working together.  If you are receiving this email, then you are
part of DM-L and thus part of the Digital Medievalist community. I
would encourage any DM-L member who wants to contribute to the ongoing
efforts of Digital Medievalist to take the first step in actively
participating by voting in this election.A reminder that candidate biographies are available at:http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/election2010/and that the ballot itself is available at:http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/YFN6TLW
Many thanks,Dr James Cummings
Director, Digital Medievalist
