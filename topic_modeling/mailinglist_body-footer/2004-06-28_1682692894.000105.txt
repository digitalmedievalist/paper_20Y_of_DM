open to the world, we don't know who will be using them, in what 
context, and at what time. Web browsers extend far beyond the 
mainstream MSIE/Mozilla/Opera world, users can be from anywhere and 
from any background (look at me, for example), and projects may live on 
for years after the development stops.I know this is a hard thing for a few IT people (and some major 
corporations) to swallow, but we can't expect the world to conform to 
what we've got on our desks anymore (I wish we could, it would make my 
job much easier). I've had a number of faculty and students ask about 
accessing Web-based materials and applications on mobile phones, PDAs, 
and embedded systems in television set-top boxes, and through screen 
readers for the visually impaired. Browsers seem to be embedded into 
nearly everything these days, and who knows what will be next? With 
that in mind, should we develop academic tools from a restricted 
perspective of only one browser on one operating system? Before there 
were robust standards, it was difficult to argue otherwise. Today, it 
is difficult to support an argument for browser-specific development 
when there are standards to address much of what required platform- or 
browser-specific functionality (and I know funding agencies and 
governments are starting to pay attention to that fact).There are trade-offs and I admit that standards, especially new ones, 
can get in the way of functionality. The important thing to remember, 
however, is that by converging toward standards, materials and 
applications will stand a greater chance of reaching a broader audience 
over a longer period of time with, hopefully, lower support costs and a 
better chance of being supported in the future.Personally, I want to see as many scholarly projects survive over time 
as possible. By adopting mature standards when appropriate, the initial 
overhead in implementing them will pay dividends in the long-term. In 
other words, someone in my role can find resources to keep them going 
long after the funding stops and the development ends.Later,
Chad
