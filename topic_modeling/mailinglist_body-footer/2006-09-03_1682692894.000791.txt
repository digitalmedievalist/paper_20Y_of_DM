election to the TEI-C Board and Council. Nominations should be sent to
Daniel O'Donnell at daniel.odonnell(a)uleth.ca by September 4, 2006.
Elections will take place at the annual Members' Meeting in October,
2005.Self-nominations are welcome and common. They should include a brief
statement of interest and biographical paragraph. All nominations should
include an email address for the nominee and should indicate whether the
nomination is for Board or Council.The TEI-C Board is the governing body for the TEI Consortium, and is
responsible for its strategic and financial oversight. The TEI-C Council
oversees the technical development of the TEI Guidelines. Service in
either group is an opportunity to help the TEI grow and serve its
members better.For more information on the Board please see:

commit time to discussion, decision-making, and TEI activities. If you
have ideas about how to make the TEI stronger or can help it do a better
job, nominate yourself! Or, if you know someone who you think could
contribute to TEI, nominate him or her!
