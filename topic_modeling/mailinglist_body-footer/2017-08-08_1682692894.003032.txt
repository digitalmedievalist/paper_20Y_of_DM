ies brings together scholarship from around the world and across disciplines =
related to the study of pre-modern manuscript books and documents. This peer-=
reviewed journal is open to contributions that rely on both traditional metho=
dologies of manuscript study and those that explore the potential of new ones=
. We publish articles that engage in a larger conversation on manuscript cult=
ure and its continued relevance in today's world and highlight the value of m=
anuscript evidence in understanding our shared cultural and intellectual heri=
tage. Studies that incorporate digital methodologies to further understanding=
 of the physical and conceptual structures of the manuscript book are encoura=
ged. A separate section, entitled Annotations, features research in progress =
and digital project reports. For more information, go to http://mss.pennpress=
