	The editorial e-mail address for the digitalmedievalist project and 
journal digitalmedievalist(a)uleth.ca has been hit by spammers who are 
e-mailing us at a rate (200+ messages a day) that suggests they may be 
trying a denial of service attack (though why they'd pick on us is 
beyond me). The result is that we have very likely missed any legitimate 
e-mail sent over the last three weeks. Missed e-mails include e-mails 
sent directly to us or RSS announcements submitted via our on-line form.
	We are trying to work out a way of reopening the address or finding 
another way for people to get in touch with us. In the meantime, 
correspondence for the digital medievalist project or journal should be 
addresses to me personally: daniel.odonnell 
the-funny-little-symbol-above-the-2-on-US-keyboards uleth.ca ;)
	Sorry for any inconvenience.
-dan
