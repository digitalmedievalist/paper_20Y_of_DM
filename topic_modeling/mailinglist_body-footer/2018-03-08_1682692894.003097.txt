At the crossroads of manuscript studies and digital humanities: Opening for a=
 PhD researcher in the project Digital ForensicsIn collaboration with the International Institute for Social History, the Huy=
gens Institute for the History of the Netherlands has been awarded a research=

t 'Digital forensics for historical documents. Cracking cold cases with new t=
echnology'. In this project, digital image analysis will be used to develop n=

e 2021.One of the two work packages of the project will develop a new, digital metho=
d of script analysis, aiming to bridge the gap between the palaeographical an=

 one script sample to those that are closest to it.Partners in this project are Huygens ING, IISH, Leiden University and Microso=
