funded projects. Alas, there is no plan to release the code under a free
software license: This is part of the funding mechanism integrating a
private company, in the present case A2iA, which is the leader worldwide in
Handwritten Text Recognition. The methods, however, are published in
conference and journals and can be replicated.I am glad to announce, as for the second question, that we will release the
plain text under CC0 license. Please note the search interface gives access
to more than the plain text, since it gives access to indexes in which each
"word on the page" is transcribed by many "word hypotheses". A "plain text"
would only be the sequence of "best word hypothese" for the "word on the
page", while it often happens that the correct reading is in the second or
third hypothese. So, plain text will be much poorer, even if, of course, it
has a great potential for further analysis.Before releasing the "plain (automated) text", we plan to structure the
corpus in single "documents" (here, typically, each royal charter recorded
in the registers) and to attribute each part of the plain text to those
documents, for which we have (more or less) metadata. The issue of
granularity is of core importance to HIMANIS project, because network
analysis (esp. on persons and places) will have to take into account the
"document" granularity and not the "page" or the "volume". So, this is our
priority by now.Best regards,
Dominique=E2=80=93=E2=80=93
