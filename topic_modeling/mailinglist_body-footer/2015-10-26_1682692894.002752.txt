Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear all (with apologies for cross-posting)The University of Leeds Digital Humanities Series is immensely excited to pre=
sent the illustrious Dr Conor Kostick of the University of Nottingham for our=
 next talk on Monday 2nd November.Dr Kostick will be talking about his current research into historical climate=
 change as well as his work on digital linguistics in relation to the Crusade=
s. His current research relates to understanding our environmental history in=
 order to ascertain a more detailed picture of the climate in the late antiqu=
e and early medieval periods. Recent advances in scientific research on the p=
eriod has provided greater data. Combined with the increasing ability to coll=
ate large numbers of historical European documents this has led to an unprece=
dented opportunity to explore the effects of historical climate change, and t=
his talk will explore what this evidence can tell us about the period. Dr Kos=
tick will also be sharing some of the digital methods and techniques he has u=
sed in his many publications on the Crusades, a subject which remains close t=
o his heart.We hope you're as excited as we are about this talk, which promises to be an =
insightful seminar from a very distinguished scholar and author, and we reall=
y hope lots of you can make it. The seminar will start at about 6:00PM on Mon=
day 2nd Nov in LHRI Seminar Room 1, where there will be tea and biscuits befo=
re the talk, and will run until roughly 7:30PM, after which some manner of di=
nner will likely be on the cards. Please join us for the talk, and if you wou=
ld like to come for dinner let us know in advance at leedsdigihum(a)leeds.ac.=
uk.Our full programme (and directions to the venue) is available at: www.leedsdi=
gihum.wordpress.com. Please have a look for our upcoming events!All the best,Victoria, James and Claudia
