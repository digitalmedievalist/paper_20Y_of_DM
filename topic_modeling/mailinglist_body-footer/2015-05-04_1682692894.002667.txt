Digital Humanities Hackathon on Text Re-Use: ‘Don’t leave your data 
problems at home!’
27-30 July, 2015Hosted by the Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities (GCDH), 
Georg-August-Universität Göttingen, Germany
Organised by: Emily Franzini, Greta Franzini and Maria MoritzThe Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities will host a Hackathon 
targeted at students and researchers with a humanities background who 
wish to improve their computer skills by working with their own 
data-set. Rather than teaching everything there is to know about 
algorithms, the Hackathon will assist participants with their specific 
data-related problem, so that they can take away the knowledge needed to 
tackle the issue(s) at hand. The focus of this Hackathon is automatic 
text re-use detection and aims at engaging participants in intensive 
collaboration. Participants will be introduced to technologies 
representing the state of the art in the field and shown the potential 
of text re-use detection. Participants will also be able to equip 
themselves with the necessary knowledge to make sense of the output 
generated by algorithms detecting text re-use, and will gain an 
understanding of which algorithms best fit certain types of textual 
data. Finally, participants will be introduced to some text re-use 
visualisations.Application deadline: 15 May 2015
