In collaboration with the Institute of Documentology and Scholarly Editing (I=
DE)<https://www.i-d-e.de/>, the Text+ consortium<https://www.text-plus.org/en=
/home/> of the German National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI)<https://ww=
w.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/nfdi/index.html> invites authors to s=
ubmit reviews of digital scholarly editions for the journal RIDE<https://ride=
.i-d-e.de>. The reviews should be based on the IDE criteria for reviewing dig=
ital editions and focus on the application of the FAIR principles for this sp=
ecial issue.Cooperation and goalsText+ has been active since 2021. The consortium is dedicated to the developm=
ent of a research data infrastructure for text- and language-based materials,=
 divided, to start with, into three data domains: lexical resources, collecti=
ons, and scholarly editions. Scholarly editions are critical representations =
of documents from the past that are primarily used in the study of research o=
bjectives within the humanities.A central task of the data domain =E2=80=9Ceditions=E2=80=9D is the assessmen=
t of methods and practices of the editorial process, as well as the developme=
nt of recommendations for the creation, processing and publication of researc=
h data. According to the FAIR principles<https://force11.org/info/the-fair-da=
ta-principles/>, data from editions should be =E2=80=9EFindable, Accessible, =
Interoperable, and Re-usable.=E2=80=9C Applying these principles to digital r=
esources is becoming more and more important, but they are yet to be discusse=
d in depth in the context of scholarly editions. The implementation of the FA=
IR principles is crucial for central aspects of working with digital editions=
; these include, for example, aspects of search, linking, licensing, and re-u=
se. In order to gain a better understanding of what =E2=80=9CFAIR=E2=80=9D en=
tails in the context of editions specifically and whether and how these princ=
iples can be applied to digital scholarly editions, existing practices are be=
st described in the form of reviews. On the basis of individual case studies,=
 reviews allow a survey of the diverse editorial landscape and can thus contr=
ibute to the development of new criteria. For this reason, Text+ has chosen t=
o cooperate with the review journal RIDE which was first published in 2014 an=
d has been, since then, leading in the review of digital scholarly editions. =
Together, Text+ and RIDE seek to further promote the discourse on best practi=
ces in the creation and publication of digital editions in general and in the=
 application of the FAIR principles in particular.ModalitiesInterested reviewers can contact us with proposals at ride-textplus(a)i-d-e.d=
e<mailto:ride-textplus(a)i-d-e.de> (name, affiliation, edition). The deadline=
 for proposals is 17 May 2022, but we may remain open for inquiries afterward=
s. Publication of the volume(s) will be by =E2=80=98rolling release'.The reviews are to be based on the catalog of criteria for digital editions<h=
ttps://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-version-1-1/> dev=
eloped by the IDE. A handout for evaluating the =E2=80=9CFAIRness=E2=80=9D of=
 a digital edition has also been developed for Text+ editions (see below). As=
 with all RIDE reviews, a submission consists of the review text and a factsh=
eet, the latter based on a questionnaire to be completed by the reviewer. We =
accept submissions in German and English.The editors of the first edition are Tessa Gengnagel (Cologne Center for eHum=
anities), Frederike Neuber (Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humani=
ties) and Daniela Schulz (Herzog August Library Wolfenbüttel).FAIR in digital editions =E2=80=93 criteriaReviewers should address (amongst others) the following aspects regarding the=
 application of the FAIR-principles in digital scholarly editions:Findable. Can the edition be found via library catalogs, discovery systems, o=
r relevant edition catalogs (e.g., the Catalogue of Digital Editions maintain=
ed by Greta Franzini<https://dig-ed-cat.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/> or the catalog by P=
atrick Sahle<https://www.digitale-edition.de>)? Can the data be found through=
 disciplinary repositories or general research data repositories (including Z=
enodo<https://zenodo.org/>, Dariah Collection Registry<https://colreg.de.dari=
ah.eu/colreg-ui/>, Humanities Commons<https://hcommons.org/>)? Is a persisten=
t identifier used? How efficient is a search for the edition using a search e=
ngine?Accessible. Is the edition freely accessible for any user, or are there acces=
s restrictions? Which parts of the edition are accessible (presentation layer=
, data layer)? Have global aspects of accessibility been taken into account, =
e.g. by allowing language selection? What about web accessibility and user fr=
iendliness of the edition?Interoperable. Is the (primary) data recorded in a standardized and widely us=
ed format (e.g. according to TEI and its subsets or specific customizations s=
uch as the DTABf) which would allow for the integration of the data into larg=
er corpora or the use of specific software solutions? Is the data on which th=
e edition is based accessible via technical interfaces? Does the edition offe=
r special APIs? Does it itself aggregate data via interfaces from other resou=
rces (e.g. as part of IIIF)?Reusable. Is the edition data accessible, and if so, how (individual download=
, aggregate download, repository, API)? What are the licenses for the edition=
 data? Do they allow any subsequent use at all? Are the data sets and their c=
reation, processing and modeling documented in such a way that third parties =
can work with them?Suggestions for ReviewReviewers can either choose from the following list of digital editions from =
German-speaking countries or from the general suggestion list of RIDE<https:/=
