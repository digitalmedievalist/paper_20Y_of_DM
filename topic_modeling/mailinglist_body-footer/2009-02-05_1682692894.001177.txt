teric new formatting found in Office 2007 is not preserved when the file is o=
pened in OO, even in the latest version, OO 3.0.1.=20As far as I know, Word cannot handle files in OO format. There are projects t=
o create converters and add-ins to enable Word to handle OO files, but they d=
on't seem to be ready yet.There is lots of info on http://www.openoffice.org/ .Alec McAllister
