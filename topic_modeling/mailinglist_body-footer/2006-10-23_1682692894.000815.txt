Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitSo far, textpattern looks like the closest to what I've wanted, though
indeed drupal looks more developed and better supported. Textpattern
uses textile, a wiki-style editor, that allows you to flip back and
forth between wiki-style markup, xhtml, and a preview. It also is a
complete content management system, though it is still fairly focussed
on blogging rather than the relatively static pages I would be using it
to replace.If only it was a mediawiki-based editor: I know the wikipedia's markup
quite well; textile's is another dialect.In my case very easy onscreen editing is what I need more than anything
with some CMS features--i.e. finding pages. I was finding it murder
making small changes in things like syllabi: a table in code is a mess,
and using a wordprocessor messes up one's hopefully clean html. The
wiki-based editor seems to get around that. Tables and lists are very
easy to over see and edit, and the translation back into html is very
clean.I hope to have something up in the next week or two to show.
