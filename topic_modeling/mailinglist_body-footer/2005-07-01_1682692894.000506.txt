Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI can now say with a fair amount of confidence that the next version of
Junicode, 0.6.5, is in stable condition. That is, it installs correctly
under Windows, Linux and the latest version of OS X, and all the
programming works, to the extent that I have been able to test it. Get
it at this URL:http://www.engl.virginia.edu/OE/junicode/junicode.htmlClick the "Beta" link at the very bottom. I will not promote this to
official release status until I have brought the documentation up to
date, but the fonts themselves should not change.As has generally been the case, the Regular style is much fuller than
the bold, italic, and bold italic. When I get urgent requests for bold
or italic characters to match the regular ones, I do try to comply.Many thanks to Mark Stansbury for stress-testing under OS X.Peter Baker--===============3866497782290352262==--
