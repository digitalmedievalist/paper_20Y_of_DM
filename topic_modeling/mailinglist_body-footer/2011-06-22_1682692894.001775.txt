  First call for papers
  SDH 2011 Supporting the Digital Humanities:
  Answering the unaskable  17-18 November, Copenhagen
  =20  Following the first successful SDH conference in Vienna in 2010, the CLARIN=
 and DARIAH initiatives have decided to jointly organise the second SDH confe=
rence in Copenhagen, Denmark in November 2011. The conference venue will be a=
t the University of Copenhagen, a participant in both CLARIN and DARIAH.  =20  Digital technologies have the potential to transform the types of research =
questions that we ask in the Humanities, and to allow us to address tradition=
al questions in new and exciting ways, but ultimately they will also allow us=
 to answer questions that we were not even aware we could ask, hence the titl=
e of this conference. How can digital humanities help us not just to find the=
 answers to our research questions more quickly and more easily, but also to =
formulate research questions we would never have been able to ask without acc=
ess to large quantities of digital data and sophisticated tools for their ana=
lysis? Supporting the Digital Humanities will be a forum for the discussion o=
f these innovations, and of the ways in which these new forms of research can=
 be facilitated and supported.  =20  CLARIN and DARIAH are creating European research infrastructures for the hu=
manities and related disciplines. SDH2011 aims to bring together infrastructu=
re providers and users from the communities involved with the two infrastruct=
ure initiatives. The conference will consist of a number of topical sessions =
where providers and users will present and discuss results, obstacles and opp=
ortunities for digitally-supported humanities research. Participants are enco=
uraged to engage with honest assessments of the intellectual problems and pra=
ctical barriers in an open and constructive atmosphere.=20  =20  The first SDH conference in 2010 gave a broad and multi-facetted presentati=
on of the domains of interest to CLARIN and DARIAH. This time we have chosen =
a somewhat more focussed approach, focussing on two major themes, but not exc=
luding other themes of interest for the humanities. The two themes are:  =20  =C2=B7        Sound and movement - music, spoken word, dance and theatre  =C2=B7        Text and things - text, and the relationship between text and=
 material artefacts, such as manuscript, stone or other carriers of text  =20  Submissions are invited for individual papers and posters, as well as panel=
s. Focus should be on tools and methods for the analysis of digital data rath=
er than on digitisation processes themselves, both from the provider and from=
 the user perspective. We want to pay special attention to inspiring showcase=
s that demonstrate the innovative power of digital methods in the humanities.  =20  Some important dates:  July 15, 2011: Submission of suggestion for panels  July 24, 2011: Submission of abstracts (4 pages)=20  August 15, 2011: Notification on panel proposals  September 15, 2011: Author notification  October 15, 2011: Final version of papers for publication (8 pages).  November 17-18: Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark  =20  Programme committee  =20  Bente Maegaard, University of Copenhagen, Denmark  Steven Krauwer, Utrecht University, Netherlands  Helen Bailey, University of Bedfordshire, UK=20  Tim Crawford, Goldsmith's University of London, UK  Matthew Driscoll, University of Copenhagen, Denmark  Neil Fraistat, University of Maryland, United States  Erhard Hinrichs, Tübingen University, Germany  Fotis Jannidis, Würzburg University, Germany=20  Helen Katsiadakis, Academy of Athens, Greece=20  Krister Lind=C3=A9n, Helsinki University, Finland  Heike Neuroth, Göttingen State and University Library, Germany=20  Laurent Romary, INRIA, France  Nina Vodopivec, Institute for Contemporary History, Ljubljana, Slovenia  Peter Wittenburg, MPI, Netherlands/Germany  Martin Wynne, Oxford University, UK  =20  =20  =20------------------------------------------------------------------------------
