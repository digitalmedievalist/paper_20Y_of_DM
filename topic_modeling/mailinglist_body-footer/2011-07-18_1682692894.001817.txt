that tells me that plans are afoot to have the site back up in the
next few months.  Some of the delay has been based on the introduction
of tighter security regulations for UEA. So hopefully your email here,
and my prodding them, now means that it will eventually reappear.  If
it doesn't, keep nagging me, and I'll pass that on. :-)-James
