are considering electronic editing of medieval manuscripts, and recording
paleographical information about the manuscript(s). I'm working on a project
that has a focus on paleographical description, and I'm very interested in
seeing what other projects are doing on this front. Is there a standard? Is
a standard approach to paleographical description possible, given differing
concerns, uses, etc.?1. First, a brief description of your project.2. What paleographical information are you interested in? Letter forms,
abbreviations, ligatures, other? 3. What is your purpose for recording these differences? Searching, display,
counting?4. How are you recording this paleographical information? Markup (TEI or
other), entities, Unicode characters, other?You can reply directly to me, or to the list. I will synchronize all results
of this little questionnaire and report back to the list. I think this would
also be a good way to start populating the "Fonts, Characters, and Glyphs"
section of the DM Wiki.Thanks!
Dot
