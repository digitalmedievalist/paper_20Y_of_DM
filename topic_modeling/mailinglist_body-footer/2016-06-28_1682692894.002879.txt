*Rethinking 3D visualisation: from illustration to research tool*The use of 3D visualisation is becoming increasingly popular in the 
study of the Ancient World. However, 3D images are often merely used as 
eye-catching illustrations, their value reduced to aesthetic 
pleasantness or technological lure. This seminar will start by showing, 
through examples and case studies, the importance of spatial information 
(such as location, dimension, geometry) in the understanding of ancient 
places and artefacts. Then, it will discusses how 3D visualisation can 
be used as a powerful tool to represent and investigate this kind of 
information, enhancing—and sometimes challenging—our approaches to 
tangible and intangible ancient cultural heritage.Recommended readings at:
