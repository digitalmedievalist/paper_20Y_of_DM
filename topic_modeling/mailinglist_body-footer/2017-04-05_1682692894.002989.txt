 focus on space and time annotations ----
** Vienna (Austria) January 25-26, 2018 **web: http://www.oeaw.ac.at/ac/crh2/ <http://www.oeaw.ac.at/ac/crh2/>The Workshop on "Corpus-based Research in the Humanities" (CRH) brings togeth=
er those areas of Computational Linguistics and the Humanities that share an =
interest in the building, managing and analysis of text corpora. The edition =
of this year has a specific focus on time and space annotation in textual dat=
a, backed by a keynote speaker with special interest in this aspect of corpus=
 management.

The second edition of CRH will be held in Vienna (Austria) on January 25th-26=
th 2018 and will be hosted Austrian Academy of Sciences, University of Vienna=
 and Technische Universitaet Wien.

The series of the CRH workshops continues that of the workshop on "Annotation=
 of Corpora for Research in the Humanities" (ACRH), the three editions of whi=
ch were held respectively in 2011 (Heidelberg, Germany), 2012 (Lisbon, Portug=
al) and 2013 (Sofia, Bulgaria). The first CRH was held in Warsaw (Poland) in =
2015.=20Submissions of long abstracts for oral presentations and posters (with or wit=
hout demonstrations) featuring high quality and previously unpublished resear=
ch are invited on the following TOPICS:=20- specific issues related to the annotation of corpora for research in the Hu=
manities (annotation schemes and principles), with special interest in space =
and time annotations
- corpora as a basis for research in the Humanities
- diachronic, historical and literary corpora
- use of corpora for stylometrics and authorship attribution
- philological issues, like different readings, textual variants, apparatus, =
non-standard orthography and spelling variation
- adaptation of NLP tools for older language varieties
- integration of corpora for the Humanities into language resources infrastru=
ctures
- tools for building and accessing corpora for the Humanities
- examples of fruitful collaboration between Computational Linguistics and Hu=
manities in building and exploiting corpora
- theoretical aspects of the use of empirical evidence provided by corpora in=
 the HumanitiesThis year, CRH will have a SPECIAL TOPIC concerning time and space annotation=
 in textual data. Submissions with this focus are especially encouraged.=20Contributions reporting results from completed as well as ongoing research ar=
e welcome. They will be evaluated on novelty of approach and methods, whether=
 descriptive, theoretical, formal or computational.=20The proceedings will be published in time for the workshop. They will be co-e=
dited by Andrew Frank, Christine Ivanovic, Francesco Mambrini, Marco Passarot=
ti and Caroline Sporleder.
MOTIVATION AND AIMS
Research in the Humanities is predominantly text-based. For centuries scholar=
s have studied documents such as historical manuscripts, literary works, lega=
l contracts, diaries of important personalities, old tax records etc. Large a=
mounts of such documents exist and are increasingly available in digital form=
. This has a potentially profound impact on how research is conducted in the =
Humanities.
Digitised sources allowing scholars to analyse texts quicker and more systema=
tically.=20Digital data can also be (semi-)automatically mined: important facts and inte=
rdependencies can be detected, complex statistics can be calculated. Analysis=
 of locations and time in documents is often crucial to understand and visual=
ize trends. Results can be visualised and presented to the scholars, who can =
then delve further into the data for verification and deeper analysis.=20Digitisation encourages empirical research, opening the road for completely n=
ew research paradigms that exploit `big data' for humanities research. Digiti=
sation is only a first step, however. In their raw form, electronic corpora a=
re of limited use to humanities researchers. Corpus annotation can build on a=
 long tradition in (corpus) linguistics and computational linguistics but the=
 true potential of such resources is only unlocked if corpora are enriched wi=
th different layers of linguistic annotation (ranging from morphology to sema=
ntics, including location and time).=20The CRH workshop aims at building a tighter collaboration between people work=
ing in various areas of the Humanities (such as literature, philology, histor=
y, translational studies etc.) and the research community involved in develop=
ing, using and making accessible different kinds of corpora. A gap exists bet=
ween computational linguists (who sometimes do not involve humanists in devel=
oping and exploiting corpora for the Humanities) and humanists (who sometimes=
 just aren't aware that such corpora do exist and that automatic methods and =
standards to build and use them are today available).
Over the past few years a number of historical annotated corpora have been st=
arted, among which are treebanks for Middle, Early Modern and Old English, Ea=
rly New High German, Medieval Portuguese, Ugaritic, Latin, Ancient Greek and =
several translations of the New Testament into Indo-European languages. The e=
xperience of these ever-growing set of projects can provide many suggestions =
on the methodology as well as on the practice of interaction between literary=
 studies, philology and corpus linguistics.

IMPORTANT DATES
Deadlines :
- Abstract submission: 8 October 2017
- Notification of acceptance: 5 November 2017
- Final version of paper: 3 December 2017
- Workshop: 25-26 January 2018
INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMISSION
We invite to submit long abstracts describing original, unpublished research =
related to the topics of the workshop as PDF. Abstracts should not exceed 6 p=
ages (references included) and written in English.
Submissions have to be made via the EasyChair page of the workshop at https:/=
/easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcrh2 <https://easychair.org/conferences/?c=
onf=3Dcrh2> (requires prior registration with EasyChair).
The style guidelines can be found here: http://www.oeaw.ac.at/forschung-insti=
tute/biblio/academiae-corpora/ac/crh2/authors-kit/ <http://www.oeaw.ac.at/for=
schung-institute/biblio/academiae-corpora/ac/crh2/authors-kit/>.Reviewing will be double-blind; therefore, the abstract should not include th=
e authors' names and affiliations or any references to web-sites, project nam=
es etc. revealing the authors' identity. Furthermore, any self-reference shou=
ld be avoided. For instance, instead of "We previously showed (Brown, 2001)..=
.", use citations such as "Brown previously showed (Brown, 2001)...". Each su=
bmitted abstract will be reviewed by three members of the program committee.Submitted abstracts can be for oral or poster presentations (possibly with de=
mo). There is no difference between the different kinds of presentation both =
in terms of reviewing process and publication in the proceedings (the limit o=
f 6 pages holds for both abstracts intended for oral and poster presentations=
).The authors of the accepted abstracts will be required to submit the full ver=
sion of their paper, which may be extended up to 10 pages (references include=
d).
PRESENTATIONS
The oral presentations at the workshop will be 30 minutes long (25 minutes fo=
r presentation and 5 minutes for questions and discussion).
Depending on the number of submissions, a poster session might be organised a=
s well.
SPECIAL SOCIAL EVENT
On the night of 25 January, the TU WIen organizes their TU-Ball at the imperi=
al Hofburg (http://www.tu-ball.at/en/home/ <http://www.tu-ball.at/en/home/>).=
 Participants may take part in this unique festivity (details later). Do not =
miss such an opportunity to participate in this highlight of the Viennese bal=
l season!
