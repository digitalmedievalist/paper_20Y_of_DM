particular, but merely medievalist in nature.There is a well known abbreviature, in the shape of a 9 shifted to sit
on the base-line with it's o-component with the tail featuring as a
descender (like the regular 9 in old-style numerals, e.g. in the
Georgia font). [It is encoded in Unicode as U+A76F LATIN SMALL LETTER
CON, but I won't use it in this e-mail, as font support is poor. Below
in the message a 9 (nine) will mean the character without further
explanation].This abbreviature was used alone meaning Latin "cum", alone with a
further abbreviation mark similar to a tilde "con[tra]". In the
beginning of words the prefix "con-" and its assimilated forms (cor-,
com-, etc. as in corruptio, commemorabilis, etc.). In Cental European
manuscripts and incunabula (German, Czech, Hungarian,...), at the end
of a string, however it stood for "-us".*I have come upon a manuscript (first quarter of the 16th c.), where a
lonesome 9 could potentially be interpreted as meaning 'correction' or
similar. However, I am hesitant with this reading, as I have not found
such an expansion of the sole 9 in any reference work so far. (And,
like with the tilde of "con[tra]" I'd be expecting further signs of
abbreviation).However, I'm particularly intrigued by the fact, that in certain
traditions of editing (19th, 20th c.), corrections by the editor are
indicated by a turned c, e.g. such: "... plunia (ɔ: pluvia) ...".
While to my knowledge this is usually read as "recte: ..."
('correctly:...'), I could not help noticing that it could be
interpreted as "correctio: ..." ('correction: ...') and that in
medieval times ɔ was a common allograph of the 9 meaning con-, etc.
(for that cf. e.g. Cappelli).Could it be, that the lonesome 9 of the mentioned manuscript indeed
stands for "correction" (and that the modern (ɔ:...) stens from the
same tradition)? Did you encounter in your work single 9-s meaning
something from the semantic field of errors and corrections? Can you
help me with corroborating data from your research experience?
Thank you in advance for your insightful answers,
  André Sz. Szelp__
* Cappelli, who has sampled mostly Italian and French manuscripts only
knows the raised small 9-shaped sign for "-us" (the predecessor of the
apostrophe sign), and attributes to the baseline form only the cum,
con- meaning. However there are myriads of examples of baseline-9
final -us in German incunabula and manuscripts.
