manuscripts. I am writing a small article on the topic and I have consulted
a lot sources (papers, handbooks) but most of them do not say anything about
the "life span" of the data in specific formats. To clarify this - a .doc
file crated in 1995. Will be most likely unreadable  in 2010.  What about
other formats? Has anyone done some research on "life span" of a specific
version of digital formats and when it becomes clear that the new version
and the old one are not compatible anymore? And here I am talking about pdf,
rtf, doc (and all office files), djvu, tiff, jpg , mpg etc. (texts and
images especially) In my work I am also making a small remark on XML as a data container since
it is, in my opinion, the best way to go and the standard will surely be
around for years. But what kind of steps do you make to ensure the
preservation of documents that have been encoded in xmlI would also like to hear if there are opposing views on xml.I also have the same question about the media. I found some research about
the longevity of CDs and DVDs but I am also interested in other media like
older hard disks, zip drives and magnetic media.I am sorry to bother you with this, but I can use any help I can get Thank you in advanceDaniel Mondekar
