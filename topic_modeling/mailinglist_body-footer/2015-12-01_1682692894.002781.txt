University of Pennsylvania
*Postdoctoral Fellow in Digital Manuscript Studies*The University of Pennsylvania Libraries seek an innovative and energetic
CLIR Postdoctoral Fellow in Digital Manuscript Studies to play an integral
role in the working life of the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies
(SIMS) in the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and
Manuscripts at Penn’s Van Pelt-Dietrich Library.*About the Position:*The Fellow will work on the SIMS team on several overlapping initiatives
that explore both the materiality of medieval manuscripts as within a
digital context and the possibilities of analyzing texts that the codices
contain. These initiatives include:   - Collation Visualization, a developing set of tools that enable
   scholars to virtually model and visualize the physical construction of
   manuscripts, relating the models to digital images and content
   https://github.com/leoba/VisColland
   http://dorpdev.library.upenn.edu/collation/
   - Digital Editions, a project to create image-based editions of medieval
   manuscripts from our own and other collections and publish them online.
   (Complete: http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/ljs225/,
   <http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/ljs225/>under development:
   http://schoenberginstitute.org/pembroke25)
   - Manuscript Ebooks, an ongoing project to create ebooks (in the epub
   format) from manuscripts in OPenn and from other open source repositories.
   http://repository.upenn.edu/sims_ebooks
   <http://repository.upenn.edu/sims_ebooks/>/
   <http://repository.upenn.edu/sims_ebooks/>
   - Kalendarium, a project to build a crowd-sourced digital tool for
   collecting and identifying all the world’s medieval liturgical calendars.
   Begun at Penn, participants now include Stanford University and the Morgan
   Library as well as universities in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scotland.
   http://schoenberginstitute.org/kalendarium/
   - Video Facsimiles, an experimental project to create high-quality
   videos of complete manuscripts and annotate them on textual content, visual
   content, and issues of materiality.
   http://scalar.usc.edu/works/video-facsimiles/index
   - Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts, currently in year two of a
   three-year, $300,000 grant from the NEH, which collects information about
   both the current and historic locations of the world's pre-1600 manuscript
   books, creating a metacatalogue for finding and indexing the world's
   manuscripts. http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/schoenberg/
   - Video Orientations, short (1-2 minute) videos that briefly introduce
   our manuscripts to a general audience, which are stored in our scholarly
   repository, shared on social media, and linked to manuscript records in our
   OPAC.http://repository.upenn.edu/sims_video/The centerpiece of the Fellow’s work will be developing a new initiative in
conjunction with SIMS staff and using Penn’s physical and digital
resources. This initiative may be a single extended project, or several
short-term projects. This would be a two-year position, funded by the
Mellon Foundation (via CLIR) and the Penn Libraries. *Required Qualifications:*   - PhD in an area of medieval studies, with a concentration in the
   history of the book
   - Working knowledge of at least two non-English languages*Preferred Qualifications:*   - Experience with prior digital projects and some knowledge of
   programming*Fellow Responsibilities:*   - Contribute to the work of SIMS by supporting existing work as relevant
   to his or her interests, and develop his or her own initiative to work on
   during the course of the fellowship, as described above.
   - Participate in the ongoing digitization of medieval manuscripts
   through cataloging new manuscripts and generating metadata for existing
   manuscripts.
   - Assist the library in the adoption of new technologies for access to
   medieval material, including the International Image Interoperability
   Framework http://iiif.io/
   - Participate in the curation of special collections library data,
   including:
      - Curation of data in OPenn (our open access collection of digitized
      medieval manuscript data:http://openn.library.upenn.edu/
      - Development of a data repository in the library for data already
      available through Penn;
      - Curation of originally developed video content.
      - Participate in the acquisition of manuscript-related digital
      resources by Penn Libraries.
      - Make regular contributions to the Penn Libraries Manuscripts Tumblr
      (http://upennmanuscripts.tumblr.com/ At Penn the Fellow will receive mentoring and guidance from experts in the
field. These include Dot Porter (Curator of Digital Research Services),
Will Noel (Director – SIMS and Kislak Center), Doug Emery (Digital Content
Programmer), Robert Ousterhout (Professor of History of Art, Director of
the Center for Ancient Studies), as well as the wider Philadelphia history
of the book community. The Fellow will be hosted by SIMS and have a joint
appointment in the department of the History of Art at Penn. He or she will
also participate in the programs of the Kislak Center and the department of
the History of Art. These include organizing seminars on best digital
practices, delivering lectures, and curating exhibitions. The Fellow will
help plan, solicit contributions, and speak at the ninth annual Schoenberg
Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age in 2017. This will
provide the Fellow with a platform for presenting new developments in the
field of medieval data curation, including those to which he or she has
contributed.*About the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies and the Kislak
Center*The Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies is a teaching and research
center devoted to the study of manuscripts in their material and digital
forms. Housed in the Penn Libraries’ Kislak Center for Special Collections,
Rare Books and Manuscripts, SIMS emphasizes hands-on work with unique
witnesses to the past through the practical study of paleography,
codicology, illumination, book arts, book history and the history of
science and medicine, among many other fields. These primary source
materials offer the Penn community and scholars everywhere unprecedented
opportunities for collaboration in multidisciplinary research and
scholarship. SIMS engages with regional and international institutions to
foster study and use of the collection through lectures, symposia,
publications, and digitization programs, and holds a firm commitment to
develop and promote digital technologies that instruct and inspire scholars
and students around the world through forward-thinking open-access policies.The Kislak Center is the product of a $17 million renovation project and
houses an extraordinary collection of rare books and manuscripts. Its
mission is to bring collections, modern technology, and a wide base of
patrons together to facilitate access to our common cultural heritage. The
fellow will benefit from the combined skills and knowledge of the Kislak
Center’s staff as well as faculty of the humanities departments, and the
wider resources, of the University. Through its faculty and library
resources, the University of Pennsylvania has long been at the forefront of
book history and material text research, especially in the medieval and
early modern period. The fellow will play a key role in developing this
field through his or her research as an integral part of the Schoenberg
Institute for Manuscript Studies team.
