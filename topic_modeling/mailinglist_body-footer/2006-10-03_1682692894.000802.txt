Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHi all,We are putting together a grant and need to find a contractor who can do
very high quality 3D scanning of a smallish object in Belgium. Does
anybody have any recommendations?The object is metal and wood and caused us glare problems when we tried
photographing it, though I don't think that should be a problem with
modelling.I suppose we are looking for a recommendation for a good company or
institute with experience in this kind of thing in the Benelux, northern
France or Germany.I'd appreciate any recommendations.-dan
