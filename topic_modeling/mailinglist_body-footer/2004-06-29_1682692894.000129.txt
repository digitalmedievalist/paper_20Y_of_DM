project to create a standardized vocabulary of codicology. It's a far cry

for the description of hands should certainly take it into account:http://vocabulaire.irht.cnrs.fr/vocab.htmThe site is "optimized for use with IE," and my Safari can't handle it. So
much for standardization. ;-)Josh Westgard--On Tuesday, June 29, 2004 10:36 AM -0600 Murray McGillivray
