I'm pleased to announce that Castellanie.net, a website publishing 
images and soon transcriptions of the XIIIth century account rolls of 
the House of Savoy, now proposes self-corrective online paleography 
exercices to help students and beginners to learn how to read those 
accounts. Four exercices are available now, with more to come. They can 
be accessed from the main website (www.castellanie.net) or directly at 
this URL:
http://paleographie.castellanie.netWhat may also be of interest to some of you is that those exercices are 
generated directly from Image Markup Tool, thanks to a customized XSL, 
CSS and Javascript, making it very easy to create new exercices, 
including for scholars with zero web design skills.
I plan to make the XSL / CSS / Javascript available online very soon, 
after just a little bit of polishing.
Besides, as we plan to extend the collection of exercices, any feedback 
about the interface, functionalities, etc. will be most welcome :)Best regards, an Happy New Year!
