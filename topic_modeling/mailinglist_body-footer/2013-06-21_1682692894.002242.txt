Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear David,To the very helpful comments you've already elicited, I'll add a few nondupli=
cative ones (with apologies for stating the bits you personally already know =
about).On governance, I am a pluralist, and I hope that DH projects adopt widely var=
ying models of governance, and that the project managers share with each othe=
r their experiences. Entering as we are into uncharted territory on so many f=
ronts, we scholars have to be a bit adventurous, and as forward thinking as w=
e can.This pluralism applies, I think, to the earlier question about forms of commu=
nication. In my experience, each project group conducts two kinds of communic=
ation: ephemeral and permanent(ish). With the first type we discuss ideas, sh=
are news, and ask questions, and hit the delete button frequently; with the o=
ther type we hammer out decisions or consensus, and to remind ourselves of wh=
at we've said and to help newcomers or the public get up to speed. My advice =
to any dh project is to pick any one or two venues most members are comfortab=
le with, as long as both kinds of communication are supported. What specific =
venues are chosen will depend upon who's involved.For my Guide to Evagrius Ponticus, http://evagriusponticus.net<http://evagriu=
sponticus.net/>/ I established an advisory board of three scholars, and speci=
fied to them before they accepted that if anything should happen to me, they =
have all rights and responsibilities for the work (this is on top of the free=
 culture license, which really gives this right to anyone). I intend to speci=
fy this arrangement in my will, as well. The advisory board, along with the b=
ibliography board, has helped create co-ownership and turn what was once mere=
ly an individual's project into a stable, sound reference work with a modest =
level of peer review and better prospects than before for a sustainable futur=
e.Each of our various scholarly societies should, in my opinion, set up a stand=
ing committee for digital publishing and research. This committee should, as =
a bare minimum, help members who are retiring, are struggling, or have died, =
to find caretakers for their digital projects, without burdening the society.=
 Of course such a committee should do a lot more (I have quite a list going f=
or the new digital publishing and research committee I'm involved in), but th=
is bare minimum would facilitate experiments in governance and help contribut=
e to answering your questions, questions I think many of us will puzzle over =
for some time to come.Best wishes,jk

Subject: [dm-l] After... Mailing List, Wiki, Blog or what?Dear Colleagues,I'd like to add a follow up question to this very informative discussion.I am also in the process of building a DH sub-community for a specific discip=
linary niche.I would like to ask your advice on governance and standards.I am looking for models and best practices to ensure long term sustainability=
 of my collaborative DH project once it hopefully outgrows its incubation sta=
ge.Could you please point me to long running DH projects whose protocols for gov=
ernance, editorial oversight, institutional ownership/hosting I might emulate=
? I am thinking of medium sized DH projects as models, so bigger than one sch=
olar publishing a digital project, but much smaller than the TEI consortium o=
r Digital Medievalist.Given the concerns over sustainability inherent in DH, I am also interested i=
n advice on how to transition a project from the stage where a grant-funded P=
I is the leader in getting content online to where a volunteer editorial boar=
d (and institutional hosts) maintain a project longer term. Also, how do DH p=
rojects handle the preservation of content for such a project? The data will =
be licensed open source, but who should hold the copyright and renew the doma=
in name after the project is launched? A university library? An s-corporation=
 independent of any institution (like some non-profit scholarly journals or p=
rofessional societies)? the public domain, the original scholarly contributor=
s?Please suggest links to examples to follow from existing projects if you are =
aware of them.Thank you!DaveDavid A. MichelsonAssistant Professor
