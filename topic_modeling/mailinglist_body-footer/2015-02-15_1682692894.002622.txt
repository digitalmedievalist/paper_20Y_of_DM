DH awareness raising activity. The awards are nominated and voted for
entirely by the public. These awards are intended to help put interesting
DH resources in the spotlight and engage DH users (and general public) in
the work of the community. Although the working language of DH Awards is
English, nominations may be for any resource in any language. Awards are
not specific to geography, language, conference, organization or field of
humanities. There is no financial prize associated with these community
awards. There were many nominations and the international nominations
committee (http://dhawards.org/dhawards2014/committee/) reviewed each
nomination. Weâ€™re sorry if your nomination was not included, or changed
category, all decisions are final once voting opens. Please see
http://dhawards.org/dhawards2014/faqs2014/ for this and other frequently
asked questions.Anyone is allowed to vote, yes anyone, but please only vote once.Please cast vote by looking at the nominations and following the link to
