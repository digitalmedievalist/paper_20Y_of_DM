any digital content, from raw data to learning objects,
music, images, and software. It can apply to works that are
born digital or to older works, like public-domain
literature and cultural-heritage objects, digitized later
in life." (From Peter Suber's Open Access Overview)
http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htmMaking the content of heritage collections free available
in the world wide web is the best way to support scholarly
research.Libraries and archives should allow Open Access editions of
works in their property. Seeing this property as a cultural
property there is no place for permission barriers
concerning reproductions.On the taxpayer argument for OA see:

the dramatic developments for university libraries
resulting from the journal price crisis the Regensburg
university library has shown with statistical graphs at
http://www.bibliothek.uni-regensburg.de/allgem/krise/krise.htm
Purchasing monographs in the humanities has been influenced
