surprised how many I had--some quite old fashioned looking now,
admittedly--from 1997~1999. Many of these are now out of "print" and, I
would guess, unlikely to be "reprinted" in their original form due to
subsequent changes in technology.In some cases, copies are likely to be found in libraries around the
world, so preservation for those is probably less of an issue. But some
of the really early html/flash/etc ones in my collection were far more
informally published. In some cases, I just have a disk from the author.The editions I have are internet age incunabula and are not yet obsolete
from an operating system perspective. But of course editions and digital
projects go back much farther--hypercard, dos, unix programmes, etc.Does anybody know if anywhere is actively collecting/preserving this
kind of material? Obviously the Oxford Text Archive does collect
texts--but in the pre-internet and early SGML days, you also had
information machines where content was very closely associated with
software (for a discussion of one famous case see:
