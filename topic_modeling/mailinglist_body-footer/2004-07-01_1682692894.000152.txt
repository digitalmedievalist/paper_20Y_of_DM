Next fall, Ill have to present a lecture in the framework of a study
day dedicated to medieval libraries and booklists (medieval lists of
manuscript and, more rarely, printed books) in the Southern Low
Countries (http://calenda.revues.org/nouvelle4283.html). I will speak
about the possibility of an electronic publication (of the textual
contents, not only the bibliographic references) of those medieval
sources, which are at the same time texts and structured data bases
for the knowledge of manuscript books and medieval libraries. I
naturally turned towards the rich concept of structured texts/documents
and markup languages, and towards XML and the TEI which seems to be at
the forefront of text encoding standardization in the humanities. Now,
although I did very carefully examine the TEI website, I didnt find any
mention of a project dealing with a DTD on that particular field.
Could anybody of yours be so kind as to inform me of such an initiative
if he/she knows about it?
 
Thank you very much,
 
Lucien Reynhout
