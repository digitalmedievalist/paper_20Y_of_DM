Script, print and letterforms in global contexts:
the visual and the material28-29 June 2018
Birmingham City UniversityDeadline for proposals: 15 November 2017In this conference, we seek to explore the plurality of engagements=20
with, and interpretations of the printed and written word in various=20
writing systems and artefacts; whether handwritten, lithographed,=20
typographically printed, or digitally conjured. We invite both scholars=20
and practitioners, broadly in the areas of design, printing, publishing,=20
typography, print culture and book history, to bring critical=20
perspectives and present fresh approaches to the study and discussion of=20
the visual and material aspects of print in the diverse linguistic=20
contexts of the world.
  The global history of text-based communication constitutes a=20
particularly exciting facet of material culture, given the myriad ways=20
in which its production, transmission, and consumption has been (and=20
continues to be) accomplished across cultural and political boundaries.=20
However, a critical engagement with script and print outside the western=20
world has remained relatively limited despite a burgeoning interest in=20
the interrelated areas of printing, publishing, design, and type=20
history. Studies of the =E2=80=98global' and =E2=80=98regional=E2=80=
=99 cultures of print have=20
tended to accommodate summary accounts and generalisations in relation=20
to the material production of text in different languages and scripts,=20
most commonly grouped under the term =E2=80=98non-Latin'. The time is=
 long=20
overdue for these narratives to expand, and address the rich variation=20
and particularity of global practices.
