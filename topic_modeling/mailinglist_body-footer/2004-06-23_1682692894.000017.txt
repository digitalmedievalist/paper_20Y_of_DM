structure. This technique, now generally known as "stand-off" 
annotation, is currently quite popular in the field of linguistics, to 
handle things like prosodic vs syntactic hierarchies.  You segment your 
text once, and then you create as many different views of it as you 
like. Each view constitutes a single hierarchy, and is composed of 
pointing elements which identify how the fragments of your segmented 
texts are to be combined in that particular hierarchy. Something like it 
is described in the chapter of the TEI Guidelines which addresses the 
issue of non-hierarchic structures.Your Shakespeare is pretty neat, by the way! How does one get to see the 
XML source though?Lou--===============0115834650741287641==--
