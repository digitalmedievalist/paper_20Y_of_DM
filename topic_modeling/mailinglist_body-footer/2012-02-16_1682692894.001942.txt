Premodern Mediterranean**A Summer Institute at the University of Toronto Scarborough, April=20
30-May 11, 2012**Application deadline: March 1, 2012*Dear colleagues and students,We are delighted to announce the second of three annual summer=20
institutes at the University of Toronto on knowledge production in the=20
premodern Mediterranean and in the Digital Age. This year's theme is=20
translation, mediation, and circulation. We hope you can join us! Please=20
keep reading for details on the institute, its format, and how to apply,=20
or go directly to the application website:=20
http://ocs.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/utsc/.*Format: *The Roots & Routes Summer Institute aims to facilitate a more=20
coherent and explicitly transdisciplinary analytical framework for=20
Mediterranean studies using digital tools and methodologies. The=20
institute, hosted by the University of Toronto Scarborough, features a=20
combination of individual presentations, seminar-style discussions of=20
shared materials, hands-on workshops on a variety of digital tools, and=20
small-group project development sessions. Participants will explore new=20
formats for conducting research and presenting their findings. By=20
teaming up with information technology specialists and digital=20
scholarship experts working outside the Mediterranean, participants will=20
have a chance to develop long-term collaborative projects to enhance=20
their ongoing individual research agendas.In order to maximize the=20
potential for future collaboration and broad, thematic conversations,=20
groups will be composed of participants from a variety of disciplinary=20
backgrounds and at different stages of their scholarly careers, from=20
senior scholars to advanced undergraduates. Participants are encouraged=20
to engage each other's materials, bring insights from their own field of=20
expertise to a broader methodological and conceptual discussion, and=20
begin to draw out connections between what are often seen as disparate=20
fields of knowledge.*Annual theme*: This second annual summer institute will focus on=20
Translation, Mediation, and Circulation. Specifically, it seeks to=20
address processes of cultural mediation in the Mediterranean by=20
attending to the ways in which language served as a central site for the=20
elaboration and contestation of sociocultural boundaries from the eighth=20
century to the Scientific Revolution. Participants, drawn from Toronto=20
area-based faculty and graduate students as well as internationally,=20
will consider the various practices involved in the transmission,=20
adaptation, and contestation of scholarly knowledge across boundaries,=20
and experiment with different forms of "translation" within and between=20
different media and genres. In this context, special attention will be=20
paid to digital technologies and the potential synergies between textual=20
and multimedia digital humanities projects.*Application process*: Your application should include a current CV and=20
a brief proposal (up to 500 words), which discusses your current=20
research and a specific object you would like to present and further=20
develop digitally. This object may be a text, an artifact, a database,=20
or a combination of any of the above. Once accepted, you will be asked=20
to compile a bibliography of relevant readings to share with others in=20
advance, as well as to install and become familiar with a few digital=20
tools (e.g. Zotero), to allow us to explore more advanced features and=20
digital skills at the institute itself. *Participants are not expected=20
to have prior programming knowledge or other advanced digital skills*,=20
but should be genuinely interested in the potential of digital tools to=20
challenge and transform current research practices.Proposals may address (but are not limited to) one or more of the=20
following five clusters of questions: 1.    What role did institutions such as chancelleries, academies,
    universities, and schools, play in developing, defining, and
    standardizing "official" vernacular languages and in distinguishing
    them from other language varieties? What role did such institutions
    play in processes of language instruction and socialization across
    metropolitan and peripheral settings? How were these institutions
    themselves shaped by the range of (often multilingual) milieus in
    which they operated? 2.    To what extent, in the contexts of colonial expansion, imperial
    consolidation and inter-imperial rivalry, did specialized
    cadres---including diplomatic interpreters, commercial brokers,
    missionaries, court scribes, notaries, lexicographers, and
    philologists---develop to regulate linguistic and cultural difference? 3.    What language ideologies and practices emerged in the inherently
    bilingual contexts of imperial borderlands, such as medieval Iberia
    and North Africa, Venetian Dalmatia, the Eastern Mediterranean, and
    Ottoman Bosnia? 4.    How were linguistic and cultural differences objectified and mapped
    onto one another through a range of genres, from court records and
    commercial manuals to travelogues and polyglot comedies? 5.    How do the histories of premodern translation, mediation, and
    circulation speak to current debates about knowledge production in
    the digital age and the role of scholarly networks in the
    acquisition and dissemination of texts and technologies?The deadline for applications is*March 1, 2012*. Applications must be=20
