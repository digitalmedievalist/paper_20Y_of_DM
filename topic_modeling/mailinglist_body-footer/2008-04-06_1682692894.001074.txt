non-deletion of the original Digital Mediaevalist page in Wikipedia.I've added a couple of tweaks. The main thing I think the wikipedians 
will object to, I think, is the fact that under external links you have 
seven links to parts of the DM website (the guidelines explicitly say 
not to do this: link to the front page, others can find their way to the 
others). I can trim these if you'd like, or we could let someone else do 
it to underline that this is not a sole-authored page. :)Final point: ideally we need a nice manuscript or other mediaeval image 
from Wikimedia Commons to illustrate this page.GJames Cummings a Ã©crit :
