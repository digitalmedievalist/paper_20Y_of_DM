Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHello all,The Text Encoding Initiative (www.tei-c.org) is exploring the
feasibility of a benefit of membership in the form of a negotiated
vendor discount for producing machine-readable, xml-encoded text in
small- to medium-scale digitization projects. Please take a few minutes to complete the survey at the link below in
order to provide us with information that would help us negotiate with
vendors on the basis of an accurate assessment of the nature and extent
of demand for such a benefit.Link to survey: https://lrcreport.lis.uiuc.edu/TEITITE2008This is the last call for comment participation. We will be processing
the forms this August and September and present the results at our
members meeting, 6-8 November in King's College London:
