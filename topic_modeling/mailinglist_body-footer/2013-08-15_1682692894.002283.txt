Kalamazoo, Michigan, May 8-11, 2014Session title: Medieval Texts and Digital Editions: Obstacles and
Opportunities
Session sponsor: Society for Early English and Norse Electronic Texts
(SEENET) and the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive
Session organizer: Jim Knowles (jrknowle(a)ncsu.edu)Since being founded in the mid 1990s, SEENET has published a total of ten
electronic editions of medieval English texts and/or manuscripts and two
reference works, including editions of Piers Plowman, William of Palerne,
The Destruction of Troy, and Caedmonâ€™s Hymn.  These editions were published
on CD-ROM in conjunction with the University of Michigan, the Medieval
Academy of America, and Boydell and Brewer. Both SEENET and the Piers
Plowman Electronic Archive (PPEA), a branch of SEENET that accounts for
seven of the twelve publications to date, are in the process of migrating
to the web. At this juncture, SEENET seeks not only to migrate past content
to an online environment, but also to launch a large-scale initiative to
present online scholarly editions of as many important literary works in
Old English, Middle English, and Old Norse as possible.But SEENET is only one of many such projects aimed at revolutionizing the
way scholarly editions are created and used. This proliferation of digital
and digitized editions of medieval texts available online poses new
questions about the forms, uses, and scholarly objectives of critical
texts. For this session at Kalamazoo, we invite scholars and editors
engaged in digital text projects to discuss new work in any of the
following areas: editorial theory and practice in digital environments;
intellectual, technical, and institutional challenges posed by born-digital
textual projects (along with proposed solutions); and interpretive work on
medieval literature that is made possible by the availability of digital
text corpora.Please send a one-page paper proposal, the Congress Participant Information
Form, and any AV requirements by email to Jim Knowles (jrknowle(a)ncsu.edu)
by SEPTEMBER 15, 2013.--===============8988127349770077130==
