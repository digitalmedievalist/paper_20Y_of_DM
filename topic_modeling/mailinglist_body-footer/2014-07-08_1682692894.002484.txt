the range of Digital Humanities Scholarship, Research, and Performance! We
welcome sessions that address, exemplify, and interrogate the
interdisciplinary nature of DH work. HASTAC 2015 challenges participants to
consider how the interplay of science, technology, social sciences,
humanities, and arts are producing new forms of knowledge, disrupting older
forms, challenging or reifying power relationships, among other
possibilities.HASTAC 2015 will include plenary addresses, panel presentations (variations
detailed below), maker sessions, workshops, exhibitions, performances and
tech demos.
