Call for Papers: Codicology and Palaeography in the Digital AgeThe reproduction of the European cultural heritage into digital resources is =
on its way. Among the various activities undertaken in this field, online cat=
alogues of manuscrips have become an important research tool: Manuscripta Med=
ievalia, for example, is a well established central catalogue in Germany. Imp=
ortant European libraries like the Biblioth√©que Nationale de France, the=
 British Library or the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana have published their c=
atalogues online. Directories with regional focus like the manuscript catalog=
ue of Tuscany (CODEX) are seen alongside the European integrative project ENR=
ICH. At the same time, the digitisation of the manuscripts themselves has gai=
ned momentum. What impact has this new situation on palaeographic and codicol=
ogic research?Successful projects have shown that data that emerges from such cataloguing a=
nd digitising activities can be processed and enriched by digital technologie=
s: there are algorithms to compare character patterns and enable palaeographi=
c analyses. Comprehensive codicological data is available via electronic cata=
logues to allow statistical research on the archaeology of manuscripts. Digit=
al editions embed images of their underlying manuscripts. Online resources en=
able web-based teaching of palaeography in a way far beyond the traditional f=
acsimile collections.The Institute of Documentology and Scholarly Editing (IDE) calls for contribu=
tions to an anthology on "Codicology and Palaeography in the Digital Age" to =
be published in Summer 2009. The purpose of this volume is threefold. Firstly=
, it aims at recording forward-looking digital work with manuscripts. This in=
volves state-of-the-art technology as well as realistic ideas for future impl=
ementations. Secondly, it examines the field from the users=C2=92 perspective=
: how can codicological and palaeographic work benefit from digital resources=
 and technologies? Are there new results that had not been possible before? O=
r is there at least a significant increase in efficiency compared to traditio=
nal methodology? We are therefore particularly encouraging contributions that=
 describe research based on such digital resources. Finally, an outlook on th=
e future development of the digital research on manuscripts will be given.Possible topics for contributions can include but are not restricted to:    * reports on research based on digital resources
    * Integration of and statistical research on data from manuscript catalog=
ues
    * palaeographic databases (scripts, scribes, characters)
    * codicological databases (e.g. watermarks, book covers)
    * (semi-) automatic recognition of scripts and scribes
    * digital tools for transcriptions
    * visions and prototypes of other digital tools
    * teaching palaeographyThe editors are open to proposals beyond these suggestions that fit into the =
outlined purpose of the volume. Contributions can be made either in German, I=
talian, English or French. The launch of the volume will be accompanied by an=
 international symposium to which the IDE wants to invite the authors of the =
four best contributions to present their work.Proposals of not more than 500 words shall be send by 30 November 2008 to:Institute of Documentology and Scholarly Editing

searchers working on the application of digital methods on historical documen=
ts. Its members participate in important international research activities. T=
he IDE, established in 2006, sees itself as a nucleus for IT technologies in =
the field of scholarly editing and documentology, understanding a historical =
document as a carrier for text as well as a physical object. To achieve this,=
 IDE members take an active part in ongoing discussions, contribute reviews a=
nd research articles, organise conferences and workshops, counsel trend-setti=
