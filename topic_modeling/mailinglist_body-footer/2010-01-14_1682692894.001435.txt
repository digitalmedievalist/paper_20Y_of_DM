teaching paleography.A couple of notes about the current version of the web site:- you may want to make it clear that to get rid of an enlarged word you
just have to click on it once; at the present moment if I let the mouse
hover over it the tooltip says "clic ici pour fermer" which is
misleading;
- to this end, I would create an "Instructions" section just below the
"Introduction" one, where I'd put the text currently among round
brackets under "Transcription: etc.";
- it is not immediately clear that the "Rubrique" and "Ligne n" headings
in the "Solution" section are expandable, although the mouse cursor
correctly changes to a 'hand'; perhaps an expansion sign, like a
triangle, could be put aside them; but mentioning this in the
"Instructions" section should be more than enough;
- in the librate page you may want to separate the link about the
erasures in two separate links, as they currently overlap each other.Thanks again for your efforts!        Roberto--
