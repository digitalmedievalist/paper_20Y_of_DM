training and beyond'
15 December 2020
The UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Association<https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?r=
ef=3DAH%2FV002163%2F1> (PIs: Prof. Jane Winters and Dr. Michelle Doran) is a =
network funded by the AHRC and IRC that brings together different stakeholder=
s in Digital Humanities and related fields to consider and interrogate critic=
ally the concepts of sustainability, inclusivity, training, advocacy and care=
er progression, among other key questions. Institutions and individuals engag=
ed with the network will work to propose ways in which the UK and Ireland can=
 build a collaborative vision for the field, and create new and sustainable l=
ong-term partnerships in alignment with the international community.
The objectives of the workshop, organised for the network by King's Digital L=
ab, are the following:  *   Contribute to developing pathways to sustained, effective and widesprea=
d capacity-building for DH researchers in the UK and Ireland across disciplin=
es, institutions and career stages.
  *   Contribute to define specific pathways for training highly interdiscipl=
inary humanists who are able to work across multiple sectors, including and b=
eyond academia.
  *   Contribute to the broad inclusion of communities beyond individuals bas=
ed in research-performing organisations, including cultural heritage institut=
ions, the arts and creative industries, and interested citizen scientists.
  *   Provide opportunities for individual researchers to develop their skill=
s and networks, and to contribute to international debates about the future o=
f the field.
  *   Consider and interrogate critically the concepts of sustainability, inc=
lusivity, training, advocacy and career progression.
The workshop discussions and findings will contribute to a discussion paper o=
utlining capacity gaps in UK and Ireland digital humanities, with reference t=
o the European and global contexts, and training strategies that could be use=
d by a future UK-Ireland DH Association to resolve them.
