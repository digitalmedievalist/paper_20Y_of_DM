know if it is true that Word reads Open Office files? I'm fully linux, 
and so don't have access to word anywhere. For years I've been dutifully 
converting my OO files to .doc format for exchange. But if you can open 
OO files in word natively, I'll start educating word users of this fact 
and send the native .odt format.-dan
