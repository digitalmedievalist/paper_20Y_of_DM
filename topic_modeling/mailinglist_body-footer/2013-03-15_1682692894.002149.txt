presentation software's task is to "extract" it from the data so that the
user can view it, but of course that's only a technicality and you're
right: in the end, how the data is presented to the user is what matters,
and of course if that isn't possible anymore from the user's point of view
there's no edition at all (and I wouldn't really disagree).Fortunately there's a push to use open standards not only in creating the
edition data (TEI XML), but also in visualizing it: the fact that almost
all new digital editions are 100% web-based makes it sort of inevitable,
although there are catches. I will be attending this workshop next month:http://easytools.huygens.knaw.nl/?page_id=18and one of the points I'll try to make is that we have several layers of
software involved when creating an edition browsing tool: open standards
like (X)HTML+CSS, which might be considered as safe as TEI XML when it
comes to longevity; open source "de facto" standards such as the jQuery
library, which are so widespread that they will forcefully retain
compatibility for the foreseeable future; open source software like eXist;
and a lively, somewhat wild open source small programs developed on the
basis of the above (f.i. jQuery plugins). In my own edition viewing
software I'm trying[1] to stay on top of this stack as much as possible,
and going "down" only when absolutely necessary (f.i. using a plugin when
the jQuery library doesn't allow a specific functionality). It's a tricky
balance you want to have between standard compliance and sophisticated
features, some of the latter being expected in a modern digital edition.R[1] More precisely, the talented young developers doing the actual
development are trying to do that, since I can barely program my TV
recorder XD
