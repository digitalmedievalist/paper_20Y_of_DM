like the following code, I can do this relatively easily:> <div class="figure" id="d0e690">
> <object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B" 
> codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab" height="480" 
> width="640">
> <param name="src" value="Pictures/Movie1.m4v"/>
> <param name="autoplay" value="true"/>
> <embed src="Pictures/Movie1.m4v" type="image/x-macpaint" 
> pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download" autoplay="true" 
> height="480" width="640">
> </object>
> </div>The trouble is that Movie1 is 30 odd megabytes and there are other 
movies in the file. So I'd rather use a place holder. Googling around I 
discovered that the recommended way of doing this is to make a 1 frame 
movie saying something like "click on me" which you put on the src 
attribute, and then you add an href attribute with the name of the 
"real" movie. If you add target="_self" it is supposed to replace the 
place holder with the longer movie. This would be the code:> <div class="figure" id="d0e690">
> <object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B" 
> codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab" height="480" 
> width="640" href="Pictures/Movie1.m4v" target="_self">
> <param name="src" value="Pictures/Movie1poster.m4v"/>
> <param name="autoplay" value="true"/>
> <embed src="Pictures/Movie1poster.m4v" type="image/x-macpaint" 
> pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download" autoplay="true" 
> height="480" width="640" href="Pictures/Movie1.m4v" target="_self"/>
> </object>
> </div>
The problem is that Firefox at any rate seems to understand the src 
attribute as a base URL. If I click on the player and copy the URL that 
is produced or look at it in a full screen, Firefox is looking for the 
href video at    Pictures/Movie1poster.m4v/Pictures/Movie1.m4vinstead of    Pictures/Movie1.m4vI've tried everything I can think of to get around this: moved the files 
into the root directory of the page, added ../ to the href to try and 
get it to back up a directory. Nothing seems to work. Since this is a 
very common thing on the internet, I must be doing something stupid. 
Does anybody know how to do it?
