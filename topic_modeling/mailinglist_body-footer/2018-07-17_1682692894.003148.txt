this fall, similar to those that universities often run for their
communities of lifelong learners. Participants in this October 23-28
trip will visit two once-in-a-lifetime exhibitions: "Anglo-Saxon
Kingdoms" at the British Library, and "Tolkien: Maker of Middle Earth"
at the Bodleian, with curatorial introductions and expert guides. These
exhibitions overlap for only one week, making this trip a unique
opportunity for North Americans to see them together.
For more information, please see the brochure here:https://www.medievalacademy.org/resource/resmgr/pdfs/MAA_Trip_to_England.pdf
Proceeds will benefit Medieval Academy programs in support of our
members.
Please feel free to forward this link to anyone you know who might be
interested, whether or not they are academics. Travelers do not need
to be Medieval Academy members to participate. The trip is limited to
twenty travelers, so interested participants should register as soon
as possible!
