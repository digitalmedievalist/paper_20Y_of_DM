four positions to its Executive Board. Board positions are for two
year terms and incumbents may be re-elected (for a maximum of three
terms in a row). Members of the Board are responsible for the overall
direction of the organisation and leading the Digital Medievalist’s
many projects and programmes. This is a working board, and so it would
be expected that you are willing and able to commit a little bit of
time to helping Digital Medievalist undertake some of its activities
(such as helping to run its its journal, conference sessions, etc.).
For further information about the Executive and Digital Medievalist
more generally please see the DM website, particularly:-  http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/about.html

annual elections. In order to be eligible for election, candidates

by subscription to the organisation’s mailing list, dm-l at uleth.ca)
and have made some demonstrable contribution either to the DM project
(e.g. to the mailing list, or the wiki, etc.), or to the field of
digital medieval studies.If you are interested in running for these positions or are able to
recommend a suitable candidate, please contact the returning officers,
James Cummings and Dominique Stutzmann:election at digitalmedievalist.orgwho will treat your nomination or enquiries in confidence. The
nomination period will close at 0000 UTC on Tuesday June 19 and
elections will be held by electronic ballot through the whole of the
week starting  25 June, 2012.
