& CLOISTER (Houghton Library: Sept. 12 – Dec. 10, 2016)*
*PLEASURE & PIETY (McMullen Museum of Art, Boston College: Sept. 12 –
Dec. 11, 2016)*
*ITALIAN RENAISSANCE BOOKS (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum: Sept. 22,

An *international conference* linked to the exhibition with one day at
each of the three venues will take place on Nov. 3–5, 2016.
The collections in the Boston area constitute one of the most important
ensembles of illuminated manuscript material anywhere in North America,
yet they remain, in large measure, virtually unknown to scholars and the
wider  public alike. Conceived by Jeffrey F. Hamburger, Kuno Francke
Professor of German Art & Culture at Harvard, in 2000, his first year at
the university, the exhibition could not have been prepared and
organized without the collaboration of a team of local manuscript
experts with whom he searched the stacks and stores of libraries and
museums on both sides of the Charles River for buried treasures of
illumination. **
*Beyond Words* will be the first exhibition to showcase highlights of
medieval and Renaissance illumination in the Boston area. It follows in
the footsteps of other exhibitions which have vaunted the holdings of
public collections in American and British cities, such as *Leaves of
Gold: Treasures of Manuscript Illumination from Philadelphia Collections
*(2001-2002)**and* Cambridge Illuminations *(2005). *Beyond Words*,
however, is a far more ambitious collaborative metropolitan project, in
terms of the size of its curatorial team, number of exhibits and lending
institutions, and multi-venue display:
The exhibition will be curated by a team of five manuscripts scholars
with complementary expertise in the holdings and history of collections
of manuscripts and early printed books in the Boston area: in addition
to Jeffrey F. Hamburger, his Harvard colleague Dr. William P. Stoneman,
Curator of Early Books and Manuscripts of the University’s Houghton
Library, as well as Nancy Netzer, Professor of Art History and Director
of the McMullen Museum of Art, Boston College; Dr. Lisa Fagin Davis,
Executive Director of the Medieval Academy of America and co-author of
the Directory of Collections in the United States and Canada with Pre-
1600 Manuscript Holdings, Papers of the Bibliographical Society of
America, (2015), an update to Seymour De Ricci’s Census; and Dr. Anne-
Marie Eze, formerly Associate Curator of the Isabella Stewart Gardner
Museum and the first scholar to comprehensively study the museum’s rare
books collection since the 1930s.
260 outstanding manuscripts and printed books dating from the ninth to
seventeenth centuries have been carefully selected from Boston-area
repositories. These include numerous masterpieces by well-known artists,
such as Lippo Vanni, Benedetto Bordon, Jean Poyer, Jean Bourdichon,
Simon Bening, and the Boucicaut and Rohan masters, as well as many
others no less notable for being anonymous. Identifiable patrons include
such renowned figures as Charles V of France, Jean, duc de Berry, Pope
Sixtus IV, Borso d’Este, and Isabella d’Este among many others. These
precious volumes will be loaned by eighteen local institutions are: The
Armenian Museum and Library of America; The Boston Athenaeum; Burns
Library, Boston College; School of Theology Library, Boston College;
Boston University; The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; The Boston Public
Library, Brandeis University, Harvard University Law School; the
Countway Library, Harvard Medical School; the Houghton Rare Book and
Manuscript Library, Harvard University; the Harvard Divinity School—Andover-
Harvard Theological Library of the Harvard University Divinity School;
the Baker Library, Harvard Business School; the Isabella Stewart Gardner
Museum, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Northeastern
University; Tufts University, and Wellesley College.  As well as lending
manuscripts, these institutions are also contributing the time and
expertise of their in-house conservators and photographers, whose  are
working hard to prepare for display and digitize the manuscripts,  many
of which have never been exhibited to the public or previously
reproduced.
*Beyond Words* will be exhibited at three venues on both sides of the
Charles River: Harvard University’s Houghton Library in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and Boston College’s McMullen Museum of Art, where it
will be the inaugural exhibition in the museum’s new building, a
renovation of the  neo-Renaissance palazzo built as a residence for
Boston's archbishop by the architectural firm Maginnis and Walsh in
1927, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. Each venue
will highlight one of the three principal contexts for the production
of books in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and related
developments in design, script and decoration. The volumes will be
presented to the public as the idealized libraries of three readers—the
monk at the Houghton, lay person at Boston College and humanist prince
at the Gardner Museum—to vividly bring to life books produced for the
communal use of religious institutions; collections that served the
educational, professional, and spiritual needs of individuals; and the
magnificent libraries that proclaimed the power and cultivation of
Renaissance rulers.
The exhibition will be accompanied by a single scholarly catalogue with
essays and entries written by an international cohort of around eighty-
five American and European scholars, including François Avril, Susan
L’Engle, James Marrow, Scot Mckendrick, Lillian Armstrong, Federica
Toniolo and Maria Thiesen. It will be edited by *Beyond Words’s*
curatorial team and published by Boston College.
The exhibition is supported by a generous grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities as well as by private donors.--===============3652879030808500184==
