also a session on manuscript encoding going on.Since this is the first TEI meeting to have a conference type set of
sessions, we are quite keen on getting good papers in--and can afford to
be a little gracious about deadlines. Let me encourage you to consider submitting abstracts on markup if you
have some interesting ideas--it ain't every day one gets an audience of
people who *want* to hear the gory details of your encoding, after
all ;)If you have an idea for a markup paper but don't know where to submit,
let me know and I'll help you find the right person.-dan
