it work as a small or medium scale Web search engine, but also as a
personal search system for email or other files.JSSINDEX http://jssindex.sourceforge.net/JSS is a simple search engine designed for CDROM or Web-based document
collections. The documents to be indexed can be in HTML, PostScript (.ps
and .ps.gz), PDF, and DjVu. The main feature of JSS is that the query
engine and the index are entirely in JavaScript, and therefore require
no other software than a JavaScript-enabled Web browser.Ciao--
