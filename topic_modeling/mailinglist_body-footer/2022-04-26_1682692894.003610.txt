Beyond the Page: Immaterial Texts in Late Medieval England
Daniel Wakelin, University of OxfordFrom some curious habits by scribes of late Middle English manuscripts, I sh=
all argue that scribes were sometimes not interested in, or were even vexed b=
y, the material form of texts. I'll focus on the scribes' handling of page br=
eaks. While in some ways the division of the text into pages allowed scribes =
to show off their own craft process, when they decorated the division of the =
codex into pages, following conventions without textual function, in other wa=
ys the page breaks contributed little to the text itself, and at times scribe=
s used other methods to override the page breaks. From such examples, I shall=
 argue that the scribes were more interested in the continuity of the text an=
d of the reading process which continued beyond the literal limits of the pag=
e. I'll suggest that the scribes' handling of page breaks adds to the story o=
f material texts but also challenges the focus on materiality in the study of=
 literature, suggesting other concerns that might be part of the history of r=
eading.For more information and to register for the Zoom link, go to Beyond the Page=
