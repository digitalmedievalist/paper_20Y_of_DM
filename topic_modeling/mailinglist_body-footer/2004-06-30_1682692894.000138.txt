conform to accessibility guidelines, should be the developer's task, on
the basis of the anticipated audience. And you can also see why imposing
choices on the users is a bad idea: while you probably should keep in
mind accessibility everywhere, it could make sense to propose a special
version of your site (lighter on resources, for instance, or conceived
for PDA browsers, etc.), but if you already have to propose a version
for "normal", standard-complying browsers, and another for IE, this
probably is not feasible, or would result in a scarcely maintainable
site.Ciao-- Roberto Rosselli Del Turco	roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
