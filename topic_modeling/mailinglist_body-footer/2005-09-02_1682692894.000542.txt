Neomedievalism in Film, Television, and Video Games 
(An Anthology of Critical & Pedagogical Analysis) I am soliciting proposal for essays (or completed essays) concerning the
representation of the medieval period in computer, video, and console
gaming. While the anthology is organized around the idea of
"neomedievalism"
(defined below), contributors are encouraged to theorize the
relationship of
the medieval / medievalisms to gaming in all its permutations.
Additionally,
although it is not a widely-known fact, the video game industry
outgrossed
Hollywood last year in terms of domestic sales, and many students' first
taste of the medieval period comes through the prism of video and
console
games. Thus, computer and console games are an important area for
pedagogical reflection as well. Possibilities include:*        Analysis of specific games (Diablo, Morrowind, Dungeon Siege,
EverQuest, Fable, Stronghold, Medieval Total War, Age of Kings,
Civilization, Warcraft-World of Warcraft) *        Analysis of particular genres: First Person Shooters (FPS),
Real-Time Strategy (RTS), Role-Playing Games (RPG),
Massively-Multiplayer
Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG), Turn-Based Strategy (TBS), Strategy,
Stealth, Horror, Adventure, Action*        Analysis of different platforms: PC, PS2, Xbox, GameCube, N64*        Chronological and technological development of games (Warcraft
or
the Final Fantasy series) *        Online Guilds and Medieval(ish) Communities in MMORPGs*        Marginality and liminality in game world and level construction*        Old-school medievalism: text based games to Dungeons and
Dragons*        Representations of gender, race, age, ethnicity, *        Representations of alternative species, aliens, and "otherness"*        Representations of medieval warfare, technology, religion,
social
structure, and cultureSection Editor for Video Games:

pictures,
TV, and games have gone through three movements of narrative style:
Modernist-Medievalism, Post-Modernist Medievalism, Neomedievalism.
Historically, these movements of style can be seen to loosely correlate
with
three movements of the technical medium of motion pictures: film,
television, and video games. While such an over-simplification is far
from
comprehensive, we have proposed to use it to serve as a structural base
from
which discussions and debates may orient: in either a reliance upon, an
expansion of, a disagreement with, or a total deconstruction of this
base.
What can be said about medievalism in motion pictures, TV, and games
that
hasn't been said before? In what ways might medieval motion pictures and
TV-from the passive/receptive experience of film to the interactive
experience of video games-be used productively in the classroom? Send drafts and/or proposals to: General Editor:
