of medieval MSS. Does anyone on this list have a recommendation as to what th=
e optimal file format and resolution would be for digitizing black and white =
microfilm? (I am, perhaps naively, assuming that because the source image is =
a b/w microfilm that there is a certain resolution limit after which point hi=
gher resolution would be of no value since the original image is limited).Any advice?Thank you,
DM
