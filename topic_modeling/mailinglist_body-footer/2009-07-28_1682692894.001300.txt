I believe you may be thinking about this the wrong way.  Yes,
straightforward boundary-mapping OCR is almost always going to be
doomed to failure on the wide and various nature of human handwriting.
 But what does work is machine-assisted transcription.  Where similar
technology to that in OCR looks through the images and finds fragments
(words, parts of words, ligatures,etc.) that it thinks broadly
similar, and displays them (with a bit of context) for a human to
(dis)agree are the right reading or to provide a reading for all the
ones the human ticks off a list as the same letters.  Rather than
machine-transcription (which is what OCR is), this is machine-assisted
transcription and much more plausible because the limitations in OCR
isn't the pattern matching of This looks like This but the disconnect
between the matched graphical component and the idealised character
transcription.  If a computer can provide a list of 100 fragments of
'th' that look similar (some maybe from 'the' and some from 'with')
for a human to confirm, then that is a big step forward in
transcription.  (Especially if it then occasionally mixes back in ones
you've already approved but look slightly different to most just to
double-check.)I remember seeing a project that was doing just this for a particular
manuscript several years ago at the DRH (now DRHA) conference I think.-James
