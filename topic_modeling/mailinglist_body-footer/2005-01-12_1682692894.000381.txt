Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit I use Cocoon a lot, and for a particular project I've built a system
similar to what you describe. I run an instance of Cocoon on my laptop,
which serves out html forms to my browser, populated with info from a
particular xml file. When I submit a form, another pipeline writes the
results back to the original XML file, using the Source Writing
Transformer
(http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/transformers/sourcewriting-transf
ormer.html). This allows me to use the amazing power of Cocoon Forms to
manage the mapping from the source xml to the form and back again
(http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/forms/sample.html). It would probably be overkill to pick up Cocoon from scratch for this
purpose, but maybe you've been looking for an opportunity to try Cocoon?
