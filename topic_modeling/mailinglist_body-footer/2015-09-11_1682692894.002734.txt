Needed: You ;-)Dear all,Just to let you know that there are still a few days left to submit an abstra=
ct for one of the two=20
sessions proudly sponsored by the DigiPal/Models of Authority team:Session 1: "Digital Methods 1: Computer-Assisted Approaches to Palaeography"Session 2: "Digital Methods 2: Computer-Assisted Approaches to Manuscript Stu=
dies"Interested? Then send us an abstract! It's all pretty simple really. All you =
need to do is read the blurbs below,=20
decide which session suits you best, and then send an abstract of a couple of=
 hundred words or so (we won't=20
count them, but try not to overdo it) to us at digipal(a)kcl.ac.uk by ish 15t=
h September 2015.And if you fill in a Participant Information Form, and send that too, we'd be=
 very grateful. You can find the PIF here:=20
http://www.wmich.edu/medieval/congress/submissions/index.html#PIFAnd if for some curious reason we don't accept your abstract, never fear: any=
 surplus proposals will be sent to the=20
Congress committee for consideration for general sessions.Looking forward to reading your abstracts, Stewart Brookes
"Digital Methods 1: Computer-Assisted Approaches to Palaeography"Taking palaeography and codicology as its focus, this session will consider h=
ow computer-assisted techniques=20
might advance our understanding of the handwriting of the scribes who were pr=
oducing charters, homilies, farming=20
memoranda and other aspects of the written culture of medieval Britain. Utili=
sing computer-based resources for the=20
study of medieval handwriting, the papers will investigate the influence of s=
criptoria and the politics of writing style;=20
the significance of scribal choices such as cursive or set; and whether text =
type can be said to determine the style=20
of writing."Digital Methods 2: Computer-Assisted Approaches to Manuscript Studies"The large number of initiatives to digitise medieval manuscripts mean that we=
 now have unprecedented access to=20
medieval texts. In many ways, this explosion of knowledge can be compared to =
the early years of the printing press.=20
But how might we best utilise this growing body of material? This session wil=
l explore the potential for the computer-assisted=20
study of medieval manuscripts; discuss the intersection of manuscript studies=
 and Digital Humanities; and share=20
methodologies. The topics under discussion will include the encoding and tran=
scription of medieval texts, the practical=20
and theoretical consequences of the use of digital surrogates and the visuali=
sation of manuscript evidence and data.
