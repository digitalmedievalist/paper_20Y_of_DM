Subject: [dm-l] paleographical encodingThe Digital Medievalist List (see end of message for contact information and
project URLs).----------------------------------
Hi everyone:I have a few questions that I would like to ask those of you have, are, or
are considering electronic editing of medieval manuscripts, and recording
paleographical information about the manuscript(s). I'm working on a project
that has a focus on paleographical description, and I'm very interested in
seeing what other projects are doing on this front. Is there a standard? Is
a standard approach to paleographical description possible, given differing
concerns, uses, etc.?1. First, a brief description of your project.
My project is actually my Ph.D. research, so it is not an institutional
project. It is focused on the experimentation of the System for
Palaeographic Inspections (SPI) software suite developed at the University
of Pisa to assist palaeographers in their attempts to classify and identify
medieval scripts. The corpus I work on consists of a group of Tuscan
manuscripts from the tenth- through twelfth-century now owned by the
Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati in Siena.2. What paleographical information are you interested in? Letter forms,
abbreviations, ligatures, other?=20
Models of letter forms (not necessarily of single letters, but even of
connections of letters in the case of ligatures)3. What is your purpose for recording these differences? Searching, display,
counting?
Characterise the calligraphic ideal for each script in a given manuscript,
compare letterforms in different scribes' work, and define relationships
among individual scripts and manuscripts.4. How are you recording this paleographical information? Markup (TEI or
other), entities, Unicode characters, other?
Using SPI, as above, that is to say applying the computation of tangent
distance to models of letter forms in bitmap format. I would like to
incorporate TEI for the description of the manuscripts at a more general
level.You can reply directly to me, or to the list. I will synchronize all results
of this little questionnaire and report back to the list. I think this would
also be a good way to start populating the "Fonts, Characters, and Glyphs"
section of the DM Wiki.Thanks!
Dot
