Has anyone had any experience of using tei to encode information about maps
and various other objects? We are talking to a group who want to record
information about maps and sword guards, etc, in a collection otherwise
encoded in tei.  Most of what they need is in <bibl> but some things are
not.
Here is a roughish specimens of what they are looking at, adapting existing
tei structures, for maps:<listBibl.map><bibl.map> <imprint> <pubPlace></pubPlace>
