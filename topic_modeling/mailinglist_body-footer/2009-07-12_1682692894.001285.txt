Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitFor those who don't know about Junicode, it is an effort to provide a 
font that 1.) is free; 2.) is reasonably attractive; and 3.) contains 
characters of interest to medievalists which typically are not included 
in the products of commercial type foundries. There are several other 
very fine fonts for medievalists (notably Andron Scriptor and Cardo), 
but few offer matching bold and italic faces and numerous advanced 
typographical features.This version of Junicode includes substantial additions, bug fixes and 
design improvements. All of the recent medievalist additions to Unicode 
have now been added in the regular and italic faces. Almost all Medieval 
Unicode Font Initiative characters are now available in the regular 
face, and most of them in italic. Obsolete characters (those formerly 
encoded in the Private Use Area which have been assigned Unicode 
encodings) have been marked with an x to remind users to use the new 
encodings; a file called "replacements" has been provided to help users 
write scripts to automate the updating of their files. As an 
alternative, a new OpenType feature (ss03) has been added to make the 
necessary substitutions on the fly.This release is a big advance over the previous one, and I urge all who 
use Junicode to upgrade. Get it as http://junicode.sourceforge.net/.Best wishes to all,
Peter Baker--===============8840388394464864361==--
