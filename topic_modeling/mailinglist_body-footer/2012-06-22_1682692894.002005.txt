TennesseeBob). I am not an expert in the production of facsimiles or "surroga=
tes". As a French teacher at the University of Tennessee at Martin, I manage =
the Muriel Thomlinson Language Resource Center. For about a year, we ran MkLi=
nux.org until it moved out to California. As a scholar, my area is medieval F=
rench, and I am founder/webmaster of Soci=C3=A9t=C3=A9 Fran=C3=A7ois Villon, =
which has a yearly online bibliography. I have taken on a medieval manuscript=
 project for the Andy Holt Virtual Library. In the larger projectWeb for Medieval Source-based Textual Scholarship
http://www.utm.edu/staff/bobp/vlibrary/codicol.shtmlI simply wanted to link lessons and discussions about codecology and paleogra=
phy, along with digitized manuscript facsimiles. I had hoped to be able to fi=
nd some that the UCLA team had not, withConsulting Medieval Manuscripts Online
http://www.utm.edu/staff/bobp/vlibrary/mdmss.shtmlIn July at the AATF convention in Chicago, I will be presenting the only part=
 of this that I am really qualified to do:Manuscripts of Medieval France with Vernacular Texts
http://www.utm.edu/staff/bobp/vlibrary/frmedmss.shtmlThis is a work in progress, and I have been taking advice from colleagues on =
MEDTEXTL, researchers in a European Research Council Project, editors with Li=
braria, Pecia and Archivalia, basically anyone with the tolerance to answer q=
uestions.TennesseeBobRobert D. Peckham, Ph.D.
