*********************************************************
SDH 2010 - Supporting the Digital Humanities
19-20 October 2010, Vienna University of TechnologyNEERI 2010 - Networking Event for the European Research
Infrastructures
21 October 2010, Vienna University of Technology
*********************************************************SDH2010 is the first conference that is jointly organized by
the CLARIN and DARIAH initiatives, which are building the
European research infrastructure for the humanities and
related disciplines. SDH2010 aims to bring together
infrastructure providers and users from the communities
involved with the two infrastructure initiatives. The
conference will consist of a number of topical sessions
where providers and users will present and discuss results,
obstacles and opportunities for digitally-supported
humanities research. Participants will be encouraged to
engage with honest assessments of the intellectual problems
and practical barriers in an open and constructive atmosphere.SDH2010 is organized together with NEERI2010, the second
European networking event for research infrastructures.
Whereas SDH2010 will focus on the types of research made
possible by research computing, NEERI2010 will focus on the
technical, architectural and social challenges of building
the infrastructure.NEERI2010 is the second Networking Event of its kind,
providing a follow-up to NEERI2009 held in Helsinki. The
goal of NEERI2010 is to exchange ideas on a number of topics
relevant for research infrastructures and to clear common
ground on the further development and application of these
topics. NEERI focuses on what we share and what we can learn
from each other. Examples of such commonalities are
architectural issues, communication with users and
integration of services and tools.SDH 2010 will have a special focus on the humanities and
social sciences, while NEERI will focus more on general
aspects of research infrastructure development across all
disciplines, including the natural and life sciences.Registration is open. Further information is available on
