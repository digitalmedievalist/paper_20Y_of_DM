	I am posting this query on behalf of a colleague who has built a neat 
little concordance maker: you drop text into it and almost immediately 
you get a kwic (Key Word in Context) concordance back. It did Beowulf in 
5 seconds.
	Is there anyway of determining bandwidth used by a program such as 
this? He is worried about overusing his university's resources.
