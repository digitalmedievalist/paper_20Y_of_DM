  *   Between Central and East Asia: Chinese Manuscripts from Tenth-Century D=
unhuangImre Galambos, University of CambridgeFriday, September 17, 2021, 12:00 -1:30pm EDT (via Zoom)Geographically, the oasis city of Dunhuang occupied a strategic position on t=
he northwestern edge of the Chinese cultural sphere, connecting the Chinese s=
tates with Central Asia, known at the time as the Western Regions. During the=
 tenth century, Dunhuang was inhabited by a multilingual population that prod=
uced a vast quantity of manuscripts written in Chinese, Tibetan and over a do=
zen of other languages. At the turn of the twentieth century, tens of thousan=
ds of these manuscripts were discovered in a sealed-off Buddhist cave, leadin=
g to the development of entirely new fields of scholarly research and the dec=
ipherment of several long-forgotten languages. The manuscripts provide an unp=
recedented amount of information on the linguistic, economic, social and reli=
gious dimensions of contemporary life. Even though they were found together i=
n the same cave, and had been produced by the same group of people, they are =
typically studied by specialists of respective languages and disciplines. In =
an attempt to bridge the linguistic barrier, this talk proposes to look at Ch=
inese manuscripts in a wider context, connecting them with non-Chinese scriba=
l cultures of Central Asia. One of my aims is to draw attention to the degree=
 of interaction and mutual influence between these traditions, attesting to t=
he mixed nature of local population. Click here for more information and the =

  *   Growing a Research Network: Approaches to Global Book HistorySuzanne Conklin Akbari, Institute for Advanced Study, and Alexandra Gillespie=
, University of TorontoFriday, October 15, 2021, 12:00 - 1:30 pm EDT (via Zoom)The Book and the Silk Roads approaches the "book" in a capacious way: it is a=
 writing surface, taken from the natural world, hand-crafted to bear textual =
records. Books can be rolls, leaves, screenfolds, codices, tablets, and even =
standing stones. To reveal their meanings, to read their diverse texts and sc=
ripts alongside their materials, physical structures, and layers of accretion=
s, we need to marshal innovative, interdisciplinary approaches and a collabor=
ative methodology, embedded within a global perspective. Over the past year a=
nd a half, we have worked to transform our understanding of the human past an=
d its nonhuman contexts by establishing a wide range of research partnerships=
, laying the groundwork for a global history of the book. In this talk, we wi=
ll offer an overview of The Book and the Silk Roads that 1) summarizes the le=
ssons learned during the pandemic, as our project has pivoted in a nimble way=
 to accommodate increased use of online environments and limitations on resea=
rch travel; 2) outlines some of our research findings, from birchbark Kashmir=
i manuscripts to palimpsests from Sinai; and 3) describes our increasingly su=
bstantial public humanities focus, including our upcoming exhibition at the A=
ga Khan Museum, Hidden Stories: Books Along the Silk Roads. Click here for mo=
