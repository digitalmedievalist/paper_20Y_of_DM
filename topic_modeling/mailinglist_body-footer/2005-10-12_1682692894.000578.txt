collection that focuses on legal history. In preparation for possible 
future digitization projects, I would like to become acquainted with TEI 
DTDs formulated for medieval legal texts and commentaries. Is there 
anyone out there working on such texts and could help guide me towards 
vocabulary/tags for representing glosses, legal formulae, sententiae, 
legal citations and so forth in medieval law manuscripts?Thanks!Jennifer Nelson--
