Lethbridge. Applications are due April 15, though we will continue to

(we need people in both areas; this is the first of what we hope will be 
a series of ads)
*Sub-specialisation: *Open (Digital Humanities is certainly welcome and 
is a strategic priority of both the Faculty of Arts and Science and the 
University more generally)
*Starting-Salary:* In the last 2 years, starting salaries at the U of L 
have ranged from $63k to $92k with an average of $75k.
*Deadline: *April 15, 2014. We will continue to consider applications 
until the position is filled; but do expect to begin examining the pool 
very soon after the deadline passes (please let your referees know this)
*Further details: *http://www.uleth.ca/hr/jobs/english
*Required information:* Applications should include a curriculum vitae, 
transcripts, outlines of courses previously taught, teaching 
evaluations, publication reprints or preprints, a statement of teaching 
philosophy and research interests. Letter for reference from three

*Postal Address:*  Dr. Adam Carter, Chair,
                             Department of English

English. We are looking particularly for either Post Colonial or 
Modernism (areas in which we have had recent retirements or 
resignations). Although Digital Humanities is not a prerequisite for the 
position, it is welcome: DH is a strategic priority in the Faculty and 
the University and is a key component in a recent central administration 
application for $4.1 million to fund a new complex of specialised 
laboratories. Globalisation is also a strategic priority of the University.The University of Lethbridge was Canada's top undergraduate research 
university in 2012 and remains in the top three. We are also putting 
significant resources into the development of our (relatively new) 
graduate school. The Department of English is a relatively small unit 
(currently 9 full time faculty members) with a strong research and 
teaching profile. Individual members of the department have great 
freedom to shape their research and teaching responsibilities. In most 
cases, faculty members are primarily responsible for developing the 
teaching programme in their area of research specialisation.The University of Lethbridge is located in Southern Alberta, Canada. 
Lethbridge has a population of about 80,000 people. It is close (about 
180km) to the Rocky Mountains and Calgary (225km). The University has 
about 8,000 students, of which about 300 are English majors.Faculty in the Department have strong connections to researchers in 
neighbouring institutions (University of Calgary, University of Alberta, 
University of Saskatchewan, and the University of Victoria) as well as 
internationally: the Department is the home of DigitalMedievalist.org, 
globaloutlookdh.org, /Digital Studies/Le champ num√©rique/, and 
Lethbridge Journal Incubator. It is a former host of the Text Encoding 
Initiative. Faculty are also associated with the Institute for Child and 
Youth Studies and the in-preparation Centre for Studies in the Digital Age.-dan--
