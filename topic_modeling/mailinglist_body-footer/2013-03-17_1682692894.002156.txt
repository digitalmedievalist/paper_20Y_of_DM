Dear all,Scholarly Digital Editing? I've just published three volumes on this topic:
     http://www.i-d-e.de/schriften/s7-9-digitale-editionsformenrough translation of titles:
     Digital Scholarly Editing
         Part I: The legacy of typography
         Part II: Survey, theory and methodology
         Part III: Notions of text and textual encoding- the distinction between digitized and digital scholarly editions (DSE)=20
is an important aspect in the definition of scholarly digital editions=20
(SDE); see most recently=20
http://prezi.com/mdt8efbe3o3a/patrick-sahle-what-is-a-scholarly-digital-editi=
on/=20
(hope to elaborate on that in a forthcoming article); the main point=20
here is, that there is a fundamental paradigm shift in thinking the=20
scholarly edition in a typographic setting or in a digital information=20
environment- should we make a distinction between digital scholarly editions (DSE)=20
and scholarly digital editions (SDE) ?
     - yes, because it describes two different processes or at least=20
different accentuations
         - DSE emphasizes that we still follow the idea of scholarly=20
editing but transform it to the digital world
         - SDE emphasizes the relation to other forms of digital=20
publishing which are augmented by the dimension of scholarly criticism
     - no, because it should lead to the same results: editions that are=20
truly scholarly AND truly digital- is the edition its content or its presentation?
     - if the presentation is arbitrarily generated from underlying=20
data, then it has some logic to say, that the data is the edition. On=20
the other hand this would not fit well to the common notion of an=20
"edition" as some form of publication. I think, a SDE must comprise=20
both: the data and some form of publication of that data. What=20
constitutes a particular edition is the definition of its subject=20
together with a personal or institutional creatorship (or=20
responsibility). Edition of X by Y. The edition may then have different=20
forms of presentation (online, print, eBook, relaunched online version=20
after some time), which may also be "versions".- do we really have a problem with the acceptance of digital editions?
     - first, I take up, what Andrew wrote...
         - "Compared to a printed book, they're miserable to read, since=20
they tend to be designed first for technical analysis, and any attention=20
to typography is typically a very low priority"
             - I'm not sure whether I'd agree on that. I find most SDEs=20
quite readable. But yes, we're still in the incunabula age of digital=20
texts. Good digital typography still has to evolve. Anyway, I'call a lot=20
of the editions listed in my catalog "readable": http://digitale-edition.de/
         - "There's no guarantee in many cases that citations made from=20
digital editions will be stable."
             - but this is a known problem which we discuss for at least=20
ten years now. And the solutions are quite clear: PID/PURL-systems, fine=20
granularity of adressable objects in editions, institutional=20
committments for the long-term support of SDE, versioning etc etc
         - "It's far easier to put a good printed edition together than=20
a good digital edition, especially because of the lack of standard,=20
user-friendly tools."
             - true, but the underlying problem is that SDEs are far=20
more complex than tradional edition (as regards content, methods,=20
technical aspects) - and that's why generic tools are so hard to build
         - "There is no standard way of presenting online critical=20
editions (whereas most printed texts are published in series that follow=20
a style guide)."
             - important point that the community has to address; but I=20
see these publications series coming up; just some arbitrary examples: =20

http://www.hab.de/de/home/bibliothek/digitale-bibliothek-wdb/digitale-edition=
en.html=20
- http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/
         - "Delving into academic politics, publishers hate them and=20
many universities don't count digital projects toward tenure."
             - traditional publishers will not solve the problems of SDEs
             - academic interest groups are starting to deal with the=20
problem of credibility of digital work (the German Historians Union has=20
just set up a working group on digital scholarship with a subgroup on=20
crediting digital work in tenure and promotion)
     - second: success on the reader's side can only be measured in=20
comparison to the success of traditional printed editions. In comparison=20
to the fact that those often had an extremly low circulation, were=20
bought nearly exclusively by libraries ....
     - third: success on the side of the editors. We had 6 summer=20
schools on scholarly digital editing in the last 5 years=20
(http://www.i-d-e.de/events-des-ide). All have been overbooked. I see=20
fewer and fewer newly starting edition projects that don't have a=20
digital component or basis. There is some pressure from the funding=20
bodies, that new projects and new editions have to be digital. But=20
change takes some time.Best, Patrick
