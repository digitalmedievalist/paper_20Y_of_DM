data; "texts" are generated from markup using specific transformations for 
specific audiences or purposes. Given this:<corr>Martin</corr><sic>Marnit</sic>one "text" might show "Martin" with a mouseover popup indicating the 
misspelling in the original source, and another might show "Marnit" with a 
mouseover explaining the assumed correct form. The differences embody 
editorial approaches and purposes, and it's these that give birth to texts. 
The markup merely strives after completeness and transparency.My 2 cents,
Martin
