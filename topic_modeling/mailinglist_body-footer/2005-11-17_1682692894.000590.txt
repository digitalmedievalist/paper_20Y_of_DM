the list:http://www.idst.vt.edu/Med-Ren%20Announcement.htmThe Department of Interdisciplinary Studies (IDST) at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute and State University seeks an interdisciplinary humanities scholar
at the assistant professor level beginning fall 2006. Applicants should
demonstrate solid grounding in a specific humanities discipline as defined
by the National Endowment of the Humanities, yet be willing to contribute to
innovative interdisciplinary scholarship and the wider mission of IDST.
Applicants should be able to teach Medieval/Renaissance Studies courses and
coordinate the department?s Medieval/Renaissance Studies minor; they should
also possess cross-cultural education and interest in Asia, Africa, the
Middle East, or the Americas. The Department has strong ties with other arts
and humanities departments on campus, and the successful candidate will be
encouraged to construct cross-departmental ties with those relevant to their
research and teaching interests. Course load: two courses per semester.Though I'm not employed at Tech, I grew up in Blacksburg and will vouch for
the area as a great place to live.--
