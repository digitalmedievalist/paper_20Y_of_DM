do, though I've not tried it and don't know if you need to tweak anything.Re OTA P1. It has been a number of years since I dealt with it, but I
believe the use of the P1 standard does mean it doesn't work right of the
box any more. Some of the elements have different names, and I think
(though don't remember exactly) that some tags may end in </>. Most
importantly, the P1 dtd didn't come with the version I had. I converted it
early on in my acquaintance with SGML, and remember I spent some time
trying to figure out what dtd to use. I don't have access to the files
right now, but the DOCTYPE may have been ambiguous or something as well.In converting it, I remember extracting all the elements, converting them
to P3 (as it then was) fixing the doctype and then using it. I suspect it
won't work out of the box with anything that needs access to the DOCTYPE
(I was using Multidoc at the time).-dan--
