I've been working on/with a DTD for manuscript transcription for some 
time that takes physical features (quires, pages, text areas etc.) as 
primary and that has a section (based to some extent on the TEI P3 
Writing System Declaration) where each glyph used in the manuscript 
including ligatures or junctures (sorted by hand and script) can be 
described, linked to a typical image or more and a transcription and 
transliteration, and assigned Unicode or other code points. Is that the 
sort of thing you're asking about? (If you want instead to annotate 
paleographic events or oddities in the course of running transcription, 
like a four-minim letter "m", the current TEI note provisions may well 
be adequate.) This transcription DTD of mine is not really ready for 
prime time, but if it seems to be the kind of thing you're looking for, 
I'm happy to share. (This is not the DTD on the Web site I referred to a 
few days ago, though that simplified one is composed of elements 
extracted from it.)Murray McGillivray--===============2078740567017426672==--
