Subject: ticer "digital library school"
=20
Consider attending the Ticer "digital library school" in August, and =20
specifically participating in a workshop called "Open Source Software =20
for Libraries and XML":   http://www.tilburguniversity.nl/services/lis/ticer/07carte/=20
program.html#3
Open Source SoftwareThe day-long workshop is divided into two parts. The first is about =20
open source software. Given the linked texts and the accompanying set =20
of software, the student will learn the ideas behind open source =20
software, a bit of its history, how it is similar and dissimilar to =20
librarianship, and why it is important to the profession.Through the hands-on exercises, the student will learn how to =20
uncompress and untar distributions, configure an application for =20
building, compile it, install it, configure it, and finally use it. =20
Applications used during these hands-on activities include: Apache (a =20
Web server), MARC::Record (a tool to read and writing MARC data), =20
MySQL (a relational database application), Perl (a scripting =20
language), zebra (an indexer/search engine), xsltproc (an XSLT =20
processor), and YAZ (a Z39.50 client). The hands-on exercises are =20
complete with sample data, configuration files, and sample scripts to =20
get the student up and going quickly.This workshop is designed for the novice and moderately experienced =20
computer user. The only prerequisite skills are: 1) no fear of =20
command-line processing, and 2) the desire to learn. THIS WORKSHOP IS =20
NOT NECESSARILY DESIGNED FOR COMPUTER GEEKS. IT IS ABOUT TAKING =20
CONTROL OF YOUR COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT. To get a flavor for this =20
segment, see:   http://infomotions.com/musings/ossnlibraries-workshop/
XMLThe second half is about XML. This workshop introduces participants =20
to the extensible markup language (XML) through numerous examples, =20
demonstrations, and structured hands-on exercises. Through the =20
process you will be able to evaluate the uses of XML for making your =20
data and information more accessible to people as well as computers. =20
Examples include adding value to electronic texts (TEI), creating =20
archival finding aids (EAD), creating bibliographic data (MARCXML and =20
MODS), and implementing standards compliant Web pages (XHTML).By the end of the workshop you will have acquired a thorough =20
introduction to XML and be able to: 1) list seven rules governing the =20
syntax of XML documents, 2) create your very own XML markup language, =20
3) write XML documents using a plain text editor and validate them =20
using a Web browser, 4) create simple XML documents using a number of =20
standard XML vocabularies, 5) transform XML documents into other =20
formats such as plain text or database (SQL) files using XSLT, and =20
finally, 6) articulate why XML is important for libraries.This workshop is designed for the novice and moderately experienced =20
computer user. The only prerequisite skills are: 1) no fear of =20
command-line processing, 3) the ability to use a plain text editor, =20
and 3) the desire to learn. AGAIN, THIS IS NOT ABOUT COMPUTER =20
GEEKTOM. IT IS ABOUT LEARNING TO CREATE WELL-STRUCTURED DATA =20
CONSIDERING THE CURRENT NETWORKED ENVIRONMENT. This workshop will =20
cover much of the content at the following URL:   http://infomotions.com/musings/getting-started/
SummaryThese workshops are designed for any type of person who works in a =20
library. They will help you learn about the current and immediate =20
future of computing in libraries. These workshop have something to =20
offer everybody. They are not strictly designed for computer types. =20
The only prerequisites are an open mind and the desire to learn. For =20
