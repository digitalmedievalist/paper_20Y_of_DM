Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableSure. TEI P5 is the name of the forthcoming revision of the TEI standard=20
(currently version P4). Janus tags is a neat term for something that has=20
been discussed as an addition to the standard. Its purpose is to address=20
the problem raised (I think here) by Dot about markup in attribute values.Here's an example. Currently in TEI (P4), you have the tags <sic> and=20
<corr> for marking either the erroneous text (sic) or the corrected text=20
(corr) in a document (e.g. this is <sic>an</sic> mistake; or this is=20
<corr>a</corr> mistake). An obvious desideratum is that there be some=20
mechanism for indicating what the 'opposite' form is (i.e. what the=20
correct reading should be in the case of sic or what the original error=20
was in the case of corr).One method of doing currently this is using attributes: this is <sic=20
corr=3D"a">an</sic> mistake; or this is <corr sic=3D"an">a</corr> mistake.=20
The problem, however, comes if the text that is supposed to go on the=20
attribute has markup itself. E.g.this is <emph>an</emph> mistake.When we come to indicate the error in this example, we have markup on an=20
attribute value:=20this is <sic corr=3D"<emph>a</emph>"><emph>an</emph></sic> mistake.Janus tags are a way out of this problem. They are use to indicate that=20
two options can be entertained at a certain point in the markup, but=20
that only one would normally be chosen at any one time. So to return to=20
our example, we might have something like this:this is <janus><error>an</error><correct>a</correct></janus> mistake.In this system, there is no problem with markup on attribute values. The=20
version with <emph> would be encoded like this:this is=20
<janus><error><emph>an</emph></error><correct><emph>a</emph></correct></janus=
>=20
mistake.The system isn't foolproof, though that's a separate issue.
