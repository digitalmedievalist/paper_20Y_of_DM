initiative, the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies (SIMS)
Visiting Research Fellowship program. Guided by the vision of its
founders, Lawrence J. Schoenberg and Barbara Brizdle Schoenberg, SIMS aims
to bring manuscript culture, modern technology, and people together to
provide access to and understanding of our shared intellectual heritage.
Part of the Penn Libraries, SIMS oversees an extensive collection of
pre-modern manuscripts from around the world, with a special focus on the
history of philosophy and science, and creates open-access digital content
to support the study of its collections.  SIMS also hosts the
<http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/schoenberg/index.html> Schoenberg
Database of Manuscripts and the annual
<http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/lectures/ljs_symposium.html>
Schoenberg Symposium on Manuscript Studies in the Digital Age, now in its
eighth year. The SIMS Visiting Research Fellowships have been established to encourage
research relating to the pre-modern manuscript collections at the
University of Pennsylvania Libraries, including the Schoenberg Collection.
Affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, located near other
manuscript-rich research collections (the University of Pennsylvania
Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, the Free Library of Philadelphia,
the Chemical Heritage Foundation, and the Rosenbach Museum and Library,
among many others), and linked to the local and international scholarly
communities, SIMS offers fellows a network of resources and opportunities
for collaboration. Fellows will be encouraged to interact with SIMS staff,
Penn faculty, and other medieval and early modern scholars in the
Philadelphia area. Fellows will also be expected to present their research
at Penn Libraries either during the term of the fellowship or on a
selected date following the completion of the term. Applicants can apply to spend 1, 2, or 3 months at SIMS. Project proposals
should demonstrate that the Libraries' pre-modern manuscript resources are
integral to proposed research topics. Recipients will be expected to work
on-site at Penn Libraries for the duration of their fellowship, excluding
possible short research trips in support of the proposed project to nearby
institutions. Proposals with a digital component are encouraged though not
required. A total of $15,000 per year will be divided among up to 3
fellows in increments of $5,000 per month. Awards must be used between
July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016. Applications are due May 15, 2015. For more information on eligibility and
