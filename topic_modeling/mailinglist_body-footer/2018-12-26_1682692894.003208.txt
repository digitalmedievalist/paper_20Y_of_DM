construction of Ege's "Fifty Original Leaves" no 29 using the Fragmentarium i=
nterface. As with last year's project on Ege no. 30, each student was assigne=
d one leaf of no. 29 to catalogue in Fragmentarium. Then we worked together i=
n class to put the leaves in the correct order, using Fragmentarium to reasse=
mble the manuscript. We used the Schoenberg Database to look for records of t=
he manuscript when it was whole (we couldn't find any with certainty). The fi=
nal step was to analyze the reconstructed manuscript to see if we had enough =
evidence to determine Use - although we only had Compline from the Hours of t=
he Virgin and so not enough evidence for Use there, we had nearly all of the =
Matins responsories from the Office of the Dead and were able to determine th=
at the manuscript is Use of Rome. Those of you with one of Ege's "Fifty Origi=
nal Leaves" portfolios in your collection may wish to update your record for =
no. 29 to indicate the Use. Feel free to add the link to the reconstruction a=
s well:FOL 29: https://fragmentarium.ms/overview/F-waajNow, while I will grant you that this particular manuscript is hardly going t=
o make art-historical waves or have any major liturgical significance, the pr=
oject was a huge success from a pedagogical standpoint. My students determine=
d the contents of each leaf by identifying the liturgy, worked together to pu=
t the leaves of each section in the right order, and used both the updated Ma=
dan tests and the online version of Ottosen to analyze the liturgy. They lear=
ned how to work in a IIIF/shared canvas environment, how to work with VIAF an=
d other authorities, and how to parse and catalogue a Book of Hours. Their in=
dividual records are online and public (I've proof-read all of them) with per=
sistent URLs, something for their resumes as they begin looking for library j=
obs. If/when more leaves come to light, they can easily be added. The images =
we've used, some of which are phone-camera snapshots, can be easily replaced =
if/when better images become available. While many of the leaves are online i=
n their home institution's digital repository, none of those images are IIIF-=
compliant yet. If/when any of them make that transition, I intend to use Frag=
mentarium's IIIF feature to import them directly, replacing the image-files w=
e uploaded to the Fragmentarium server. In the meantime, the Fragmentarium re=
cords for individual leaves include URLs of home-repository records if they e=
xist.This is the fourth Book of Hours reconstruction I've worked on with my studen=
ts - we've done Ege 29, 30, 47, and 48 so far. In case you're interested, her=
e are the other links:FOL 30: https://fragmentarium.ms/overview/F-djs6
FOL 47: https://lis464.omeka.net/
FOL 48: https://fol48.omeka.net/Next year, we'll work on FOL 31.=20I hope you are all well, and I wish you all the best in 2019!Lisa
