>I don't know why this problem cropped up; naturally the FindGlyph program do=
es not itself muck about with people's operating systems: it's really just a =
little script bundled up with some MS Visual Basic runtime libraries, and the=
 installation program is all Microsoft's. I ran the installer myself just now=
 (on Win2k) and I noticed that it suggested I shut down other applications in=
 case it had to "install system files" or "update shared files". This is an e=
ntirely generic message built into Visual Basic's installer program. Your col=
league's report is a bit thin on actual details, so I don't know, but this ma=
y be what they're referring to? If so, it is actually quite normal for VB pro=
grams to depend on several runtime DLL libraries which are often, but not alw=
ays, already installed on users' computers. Typically the installer program w=
ill pop up a dialog box when there is an existing version file, and offer the=
 user the option to keep their existing file, or replace it with the newer ve=
rsion.
