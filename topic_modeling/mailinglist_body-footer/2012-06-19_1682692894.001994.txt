Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableDear David,In the Online Froissart we use small JPEGs at screen resolution (calculated a=
ssuming the highest resolutions on common commercially available systems, see=
 for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution).For more sophisticated image viewing, which allows zooming, we use the Virtua=
l Vellum manuscript viewer, which was developed for our project (see http://w=
ww.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=3Dvv). Is is written in=
 Java, so requires Java to be installed on the machine used to access the ima=
ges, but most computers these days have this. The obvious advantage is that i=
t will run on any system that can run Java. Our default full image resolution=
 size is 600 dpi (relative to the original MS, which means 150 MB in TIFF and=
 about 6MB in slightly lossy JPEG2000, although some image collections provid=
ed by partners are at 300 DPI).For our project we deploy the viewer in a separate window, but it can also be=
 embedded in browser pages (see http://cbers.shef.ac.uk/manuscripts/index.htm=
l). Apart from possibilies of zooming and displaying many images side by side=
 (in stand-alone windows only), Virtual Vellum can measure areas of the page =
(size of initials, colums etc.). It is also possible to display transcription=
 (and even translation) as a separate layer within the Virtual Vellum viewer =
(check this out on Besancon MS 865). Transcription (and translation) will res=
pond to changes in the images and therefore zoom in and change view when you =
change the main image view.The native image format used by Virtual Vellum is JPEG2000, but the software =
comes with a utility to create JPEG2000 libraries of images from several inpu=
t formats (including TIFF and JPEG).Virtual Vellum is freely available for non-commercial use by single users or =
projects. It can be used on local images collections or embedded as a Java-ap=
plet for web display (for links to documentation and downloads, see http://ww=
w.shef.ac.uk/hri/projects/projectpages/virtualvellum).Godfried Croenen

Subject: [dm-l] best practice: photographc facsimile?Dear Digital Medievalist,For a couple of new Internet editions of medieval manuscripts I've procured h=
igh-resolution tiff images, which I'm publishing with a "magnifying glass" ov=
erlay. This is in a "responsive" context, so the components of the page, incl=
uding the images, resize to fit the window dimensions. There's a sample at:http://suprasliensis.obdurodon.org/pages/supr001r.htmlThe current images were prepared quickly for a demo, and are not of consisten=
t size or resolution. I would now like to go back to get this part of the sit=
e up to production quality, and I would be grateful for advice about how to m=
anage the images, an area where I don't have much (=3D any) knowledge of best=
 practice. I'd like small image files that load quickly, and I think I don't =
mind slightly lossy compression if that would reduce the file size substantia=
lly--but if that's a mistake, I'd be grateful for a warning. I think there ar=
e two questions:1. What's an appropriate file format and resolution (size, dpi, color depth, =
etc.) for the base image, the one that is displayed in full to the right of t=
he transcription, and that resizes as the user resizes the window? Currently =
the image files are in jpg format and vary in size from about 2M down to 250k=
. I can regenerate them all at a common size, resolution, color depth, etc. f=
rom the original tiffs, but I don't know whether there is any sense of best p=
ractice concerning what that size should be. If I go the lossy route, what's =
a reasonable value?2. What's an appropriate degree of magnification for the magnifying-glass ins=
et view? Currently the magnifying glass inset always shows the image at 200% =
of the actual file size (not the size of the page as displayed without magnif=
ication in the browser window!). You can see the difference by comparing, say=
, folio 30v (about 2MB) to 284r (about 270k), where the magnification is much=
 greater in the former than the latter. I can set the level of magnification =
anywhere I'd like, but is there any agreement about best practice here?By way of orientation in the question: the purpose of the full image is to al=
low the user to see the image conveniently alongside the transcription, verif=
ying any moments where our editorial judgment might appear surprising or ques=
tionable. The point of the magnified inset is to let the user examine details=
 that may not be visible at lesser magnification, such as erasures, correctio=
ns, etc. My casual impression is that 30v looks pretty good and loads reasona=
bly quickly (although quicker would be better), but I don't place great confi=
dence in my own casual impressions.Thanks,David
