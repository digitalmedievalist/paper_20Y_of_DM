John,OSX 10.3 (Panther) has changed the character palette a bit. In the 
display of all the Unicode categories, you can no longer select an 
individual font from a drop down menu as you could in previous 
versions. However, you can do so in the "Gylph Catalog" function, 
which shows all the characters available for a font (incidentally, 
here the wynn is row 046, column 3 (really 4)). Upon further investigation, it turns out the Junicode runes display 
just fine in the Glyph Catalog, but do not display under the Unicode 
categories option. In the Unicode categories, you now select a 
character from a Unicode Block (e.g. "Runic") and all available fonts 
that can display that character appear in a frame below.  In the main 
display window, all the runes (except, oddly, the first one) appear as 
horizontal lines. clicking on these, though, does indicate that a 
Junicode Regular version of the rune exists, but it too displays as a 
striaght line. Inserting the rune, though, correctly displays it in 
Word 2004 and elsewhere.But this appears to be an issue with the character palette, and not 
Word 2004 (I have installed the actual release). Word 2004 seems to 
work fine, and the Glyph Catalog works just fine as well, so there is 
an easy way to  implement all characters into Word and other Unicode 
processors.best,~ Martin Foys~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Martin K. Foys
