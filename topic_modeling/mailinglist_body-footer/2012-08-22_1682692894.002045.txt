visualisation as well, so you're in good company.Can you give some examples of the ones you've been adding the linguistic
information to? That might help members of the list understand the
issues involved.I'd also like to ask what formats you are using for recording the data.=20
I.e. when you enter the linguistic information or otherwise edit the=20
entry, what does the entry look like? Is it a form-based relational=20
database? Is it HTML? Is it XML?I'm only beginning to work with geographic data myself (my very first=20
experiment is here, and its just on Google maps:=20
http://dpod.kakelbont.ca/2012/07/17/sightlines-a-visualisation-of-the-holocau=
st-along-two-blocks-in-hamburg/)But it is certainly possible to link things.Anybody with more experience?-danOn 12-08-21 06:51 AM, Dan Mosser wrote:
