the first Digital Editions; the thread was started because of a Junius
11 CD not working anymore under MacOX. I don't think we need a formal
permission to copy these messages here (they were on a public forum
already, and it's not for commercial purpose), of course if I'm wrong
please delete this message.You'll find the message thread in attachment.Ciao	Roberto-- Roberto Rosselli Del Turco      roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
