Subject: [dm-l] New resource: Enigma - Unpuzzling difficult Latin readings in
medieval manuscripts> Dear list members, 
> 
> Since I assume most of us work with Latin manuscripts at least sometimes, I
would like to share here the news of the release of my latest development,
called "Enigma" (Latin word for "puzzle"): 
> http://ciham-digital.huma-num.fr/enigma/ 
> "Enigma helps scholars to decipher Latin words which are difficult to read
in medieval manuscripts. It is sometimes impossible to decipher all the
letters in a word, for various reasons (difficult palaeography, unclear
writing, damage to the document, etc.) If you type the letters you can read
and add wildcards, Enigma will list the possible Latin forms, drawing from its
database of more than 400 000 forms."
