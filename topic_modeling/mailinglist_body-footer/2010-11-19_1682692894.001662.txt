digital edition in particuar) you would suggest to students? I mean 
medievalist students, at the MASTER level, who are new to all things 
digital but whant to understand (to believe?!? ;))I usually recommend the "Companion to Digital Humanities"; anything else?
Best wishes, MarjoriePS: I'd be interested in references in French languages too (MASTER 
students tend to be a tad monolingual, even though they make efforts)
