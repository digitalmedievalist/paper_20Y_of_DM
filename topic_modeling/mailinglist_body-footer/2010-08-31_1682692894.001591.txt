August 30, 2010. Over those 4 days, 53 people evaluated 7,779 images. We
want to thank all of you who participated.  Below is a table showing how
images were categorized during the project:
  CategoryNumberPercentage good339646%close190226%bad115316%disaster75310%don't know391%irrelevant442-----
Based on closer examination of the images that were judged to be =E2=80=9Cbad=
=E2=80=9D or a
=E2=80=9Cdisaster,=E2=80=9D we have 3 areas of focus for future development:(1)    We will use a method from another project to identify large initials,
which proved quite problematic for the tool.(2)    We will reduce the number of two column manuscripts in which the left
column does not have its lines properly detected by modifying the way the
column boundary is drawn, so it does not include the outside border.(3)    We will work to detect marginal content as such, and parse lines of
marginal content seperately from the columns of text.We hope to begin work on our transcription tool in the beginning of October,
and release this detection tool as an API by the end of October.So thank you again for all your hard work.
Jim
