of the etymology of CURSUS. James might know? But the similar sounding
names are a red herring.CURSUS is a corpus of transcriptions of liturgical books. It provides
quite a fine level of granularity as well as detailed semantic
tagging. From what I understand, CANTUS is a database of chant
incipits which, again, provides rich semantics. Probably the key
difference is that of transcription vs. database. For example, CANTUS'
incipits consist of up to 29 characters of what appeared in the
witness, whereas CURSUS transcribes the whole manuscript and
automatically generates incipit views.Another way of conceptualising the relationship is that, in theory,
CANTUS could be derived from CURSUS, but CANTUS could not be used to
re-construct CURSUS.Hope that helps.Best,
RichardPS. I'm now getting an idea of what hosting provisions will be
available at UEA in the future.
