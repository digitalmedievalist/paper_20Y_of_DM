nities scholars working with XML documents (such as TEI, EAD, or MODS).The XQuery Summer Institute is designed for scholars with basic experience ma=
rking up texts who would like to acquire advanced skills in how to query and =
computationally analyze XML documents.We welcome applications from archivists, faculty members, librarians, alt-ac =
professionals, and advanced graduate students. Over the course of two weeks, =
we will teach you how to program in XQuery, a language designed for querying =
and manipulating XML documents. You will leave the Institute knowing how to m=
aximize the value of your XML encoding.The Institute will take place from Monday, June 9 to Friday, June 20 in 2014 =
on the campus of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. It will be le=
d by six instructors with experience in the digital humanities (see http://xq=
ueryinstitute.org/instructors), including Jonathan Robie, Lead Editor of the =
XQuery and XPath specifications at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).There are no registration costs to the Institute thanks to generous support f=
rom the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humani=
ties (see the announcement of Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital H=
