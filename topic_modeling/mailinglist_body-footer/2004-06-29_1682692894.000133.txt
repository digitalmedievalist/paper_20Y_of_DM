old practice (the not-Janus-practice) of which one has already been mentioned:1.) You cannot tag attribute values any further. So you limit your own
possibilities of sophisticated (that is: adequate) information (re-)coding.2.) The point which hasn't been mentioned (on this list - I'm not
subscribed to the TEI-List). The old practice is simply to supplant one
theory (or notion) of text with another theory (or notion) of text. You had
(for example) to decide wether to believe that text is a material object (a
document --> <sic>) or an abstract entity (a linguistic event, a
communication intention --> <corr>). Now - with the Janus practice -
there's just pluralistic democracy of various theories / notions (or an
integrative theory) of "text".Well, there could be a third area of discussion: What is the status of an
electronic text and what does the borderline between "text" and "markup"
really mean (for this case)? The problem here could be, that - if you
believe in the ontological discrimination of "text" and "markup" - you seem
to double the portion of "text" in question. But this is no question of
practical relevance and only leads to a philosophical sophistry which maybe
should better be left to an even more specialised debate (and my
forthcoming PhD-thesis ;-)) ...cheers, patrick
