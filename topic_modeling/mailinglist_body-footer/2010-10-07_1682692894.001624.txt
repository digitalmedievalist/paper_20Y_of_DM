Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableI agree with Jesse: any referencing system we develop is going to have=20
to be on the scholar side rather than the producer side, since the=20
stakes are higher for us and we won't be able to rely on publishers or=20
content designers doing the work for us.An ideal solution would be that every producer put in a unique id at the=20
beginning of every example of some agreed upon unit of text (paragraph=20
or segment of so many characters, or whatever). But I suspect that=20
counting paragraphs oneself is the only reliable way of doing this. Of=20
course some canonical texts might well acquire common units (like=20
chapter and verse).In that sense, I think it is probably like why HTML took off, but the=20
semantic web is much slower (even through Tim Berners Lee discusses both=20
in his original memo). Not everybody cares about semantically rich data,=20
so the lowest common denominator was simply "content in document with=20
pointed brackets" not "content tied to a recognised ontological schema."-danOn 10-10-07 11:08 AM, Jesse Hurlbut wrote:
