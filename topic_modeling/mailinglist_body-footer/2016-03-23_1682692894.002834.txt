the text under different points of view (resources, analysis,=20
infrastructures), in order to bring together philologists, historians,=20
digital humanists, computational linguists, logicians, computer=20
scientists and software engineers and discuss about the text.It is time for research infrastructures to be able to guarantee=20
interoperability and integration between the instruments for=20
philological studies and the instruments for the analysis of large=20
textual corpora, breaking down the rigid barriers between digital and=20
computational philology on the one hand, and corpus linguistics on the=20
other hand.As a consequence, without ruling out other possible topics belonging to=20
the Digital Humanities area, we solicit your contributions (talks and=20
posters) on these topics:_Representation and Interoperability_  * Which digital representation models prove most effective for=20
overcoming the dichotomy between diplomatic and critical editions?
  * How to integrate multimedia products (such as 2D images, 3D models,=20
audio, video) in the digital edition?
  * How to apply the methods of digital philology to multimedia products=20
(such as film quotations, restored versions, musical variations, etc.)?
  * How to build a constructive dialogue between traditional=20
philologists and digital philologists?_Text Analysis and Digital Objects Processing_  * Which extensions are needed, in order to apply the methods of=20
computational linguistics to the study of variants?
  * How to create linguistic and textual analysis chains starting from=20
texts that present variants?
  * How can computational linguistic tools be used to bring out regions=20
of interest in large amounts of text on which to focus the attention?
  * What is the state of art for the analysis of digital objects?
  * How to assess the quality of analyses produce by means of the=20
crowdsourcing method?_Infrastructures_What can research infrastructures offer for the management of digital=20
editions?
How to conduct a study of requirements for infrastructures so that they=20
are increasingly accessible to both digital humanists and traditional=20
philologists?
How can Digital humanities scholars be put in contact with the community=20
of traditional scholars?_Communities and Collaboration_  * Which benefits do the interaction and the involvement of teachers,=20
high school and university students in digital editions projects bring=20
to research activities?
  * How can digital libraries collaborate to create, access, share and=20
reuse digital resources?
  * How may teachers and students get interested in the dissemination of=20
research results?
  * How do digital libraries contribute to the dissemination of research=20
results?
  * How to prepare a shared syllabus, in order to train digital=20
humanists to become aware of aware of the problems and potentialities of=20
digital editions?
  * Which are the best practices to enroll a broader audience in the use=20
of digital editions?*Abstract submission*The contributions (talks and posters), to be proposed in the form of an=20
abstract of 1000 words maximum, in PDF format, must be loaded through=20
the EasyChair Web site at this URL:=20
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Daiucd2016. Abstracts will be=20

will be communicated to the authors by June 30, 2016.*Abstract preparation and evaluation*The abstract should describe the objectives of the contribution, a brief=20
reference to the state of the art, the methodology adopted, and - if=20
possible - the results achieved or expected. It should also contain a=20
bibliography.The call for papers welcome three types of contributions: (1) full=20
paper, mainly to discuss innovative methodologies; (2) short paper,=20
mainly to present accomplished research outputs; (3) poster, mainly to=20
present early and innovative work in progress.The conference proposals will be selected through peer-reviewing by at=20
least two Italian and/or foreign scholars expert in the fields of=20
(Digital) Humanities and/or Computer Science.At the end of the evaluation process, the Scientific Committee may=20
decide to move an accepted proposal to a different category.*Instructions for talks*Full papers will last 30 minutes (20-25 min + 5-10 min for questions).=20
Short papers will last 20 minutes (15 min + 5 min for questions). The=20
