working on:
I try to document the manuscript transmission of late antique and early medie=
val monastic texts. I especially focus on monastic rules and on understudied =
texts with a wide dissemination.
As a side product I collected links to all catalogues of medieval manuscripts=
 that are online or available on archive org - which turned out to be a rathe=
r useful tool. I am also collecting links to ongoing digital manuscript proje=
cts.
Especially for these pages I would be very happy to get some input from you.
Here are the links:
