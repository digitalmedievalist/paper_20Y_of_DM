d'Enseignement en Histoire – Université Paris 1) is organizing at the 
Sorbonne a conference on the relationship between History, language and 
text analysis, with the support of the university Paris 1 
Pantheon-Sorbonne and the Lamop (Laboratoire de Médiévistique 
Occidentale de Paris).Through 27 papers and 7 posters, the participants will explore the 
present uses of statistical and computational analysis of texts in 
history. Recent intellectual and technical developments invite us to 
rethink and redefine the way these tools can be used by historians, 
whether for combining history and linguistics, exploring or mining 
massive textual sources, or for enriching more traditional historical 
methods.Short texts and ego-documents, a type of source frequently used by 
historians will be the topic of a first session. Another group of papers 
will show how data mining can be used to explore and study large corpora 
of historical texts. A full session will be devoted to temporality in 
text analysis, an essential yet often neglected dimension in the work of 
historians. The last session will adress the relationship between 
language, concepts, and authority and the uses of text analysis in this 
field of study.Program, informations and registration:
