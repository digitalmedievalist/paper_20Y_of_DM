set up a project for developing a federated search facility for
manuscripts. One of the options now being worked on is using the
technique of harvesting through the OAI protocol. 
In order to make a recommendation on how to proceed after the project
phase I would like to know a bit more about how many manuscripts
databases (both with and without images) support harvesting through OAI.
I am hoping you could help me with this.
Those of you involved with manuscript databases I would like to ask the
following three questions:
- do you support searching by Z39.50 or SRU, or harvesting through
OAI?
- what kind of material does your database contain (period, spatial
coverage, number of records)?
- might you, in principal, be interested in taking part in an
international federated search facility?I thank you in advance for your input in this small investigation,
best wishes,Liesbeth Oskamp
