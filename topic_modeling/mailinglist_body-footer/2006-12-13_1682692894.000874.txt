<http://www.kantl.be/ctb/> of the Royal Academy of Dutch Language and
Literature, the Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH)
<http://www.kcl.ac.uk/humanities/cch/> of King's College London, and the
School for Library, Archive, and Information Studies (SLAIS)
<http://www.slais.ucl.ac.uk/> of University College London, are involved
in the joint project "TEI by Example".Featuring freely available online tutorials walking individuals through
the different stages in marking up a document in TEI (Text Encoding
Initiative <http://www.tei-c.org>), these online tutorials will provide
examples for users of all levels. Examples will be provided of different
document types, with varying degrees in the granularity of markup, to
provide a useful teaching and reference aid for those involved in the
marking up of texts.Eight tutorial modules will address a wide range of issues in text
encoding with TEI:
1. Introduction to text encoding with TEI
2. The TEI header
3. Prose
4. Poetry
5. Drama
6. Manuscript Transcription
7. Scholarly Editing
8. Customizing TEI, ODD, RomaTo build as much as possible on available sources of existing practice
in the field and to be able to present a broad view on the wide variety
of encoding practices, we warmly welcome you to contribute TEI-encoded
examples (either fragments or complete texts) that are applicable to any
of these subjects. Examples are preferably encoded as TEI P5 XML texts,
but also texts encoded in TEI P4 XML, other XML formats, or other
(documented) electronic formats are of interest. Even examples of
less-ideal encoding practices are welcome, since the idea of learning by
error is a valuable didactic principle. Please do provide some
indication of the errors or controversies in such examples when
appropriate. After selection and editing, the example fragments will be
incorporated in the freely available online deliverables, which will be
issued under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No
Derivatives licence (see
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/>). All contributors
will be credited.The examples can be sent (preferably compressed in .zip format and with
an indication of applicability and credits due) to
teibyexample(a)kantl.be. Please do not hesitate to contact us for any
inquiries regarding copyright issues or any more general issues.Kind regards,The project team:Ron Van den Branden,
