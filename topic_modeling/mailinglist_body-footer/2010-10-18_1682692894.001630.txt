had this question specifically concerning citing Kindle or iPad ebooks in
MLA format.  I have students using their Kindles and iPads and this question
has come up quite often.  I asked a professor about how to cite those
editions in MLA and more specifically about the reference locations.  He was
unsure about the reference locations (and said he would check on it), but
this was the response I was given by Dr. Jim Harner about citing them in MLA
and I thought I would share it:Several people have asked me about citing a Kindle a la MLA. I contacted
David Nicholls at MLA: he reported that MLA is working on a form that
resembles he citation of a non-periodical CD-ROM:
Author. Title. Publication information. Kindle.
Until that form is finalized, he said MLA is recommending using the form for
citing a digital file (6.8.18 in the MLA Style Manual; 5.7.18 in the
Handbook).
