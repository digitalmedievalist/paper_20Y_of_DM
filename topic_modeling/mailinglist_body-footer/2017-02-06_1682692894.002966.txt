criticaldiversityThe College of Arts & Letters and the College of Social Science at Michigan
State University seek a group of culturally engaged digital arts and
humanities scholars to join a transformative initiative to explore,
interrogate, and cultivate Critical Diversity in a Digital Age. We are
looking for creative, collaborative leaders in digital humanities and
digital arts who think synthetically about scholarship, teaching, and
creative endeavors. These new colleagues will join a group of faculty and
students at Michigan State University with an energetic focus on humanities
questions of race, inclusion, cultural preservation, global
interconnectedness, and engaged scholarship.  They will be part of the
Consortium for Critical Diversity in a Digital Age Research (CEDAR), which
serves as an interdisciplinary catalyst for MSU scholars, artists, and
teachers who work at the intersections of self/society, digital/material,
technology/culture to advance leading-edge scholarship and creative
activity that integrates diversity in a digital age.
Our aim is to lead a movement in humanities scholarship that engages the
contemporary digital world with a discerning sense of critique rooted in
ethical imagination and oriented toward creating more just communities.
Three broad mission areas shape our initiative for Critical Diversity in a
Digital Age: (1) To expose the limits of existing practices and structures
of reality in order to interrogate the conditions under which they operate
and thus to uncover what they enable and prevent; (2) To discern what is
possible in the wake of this exposure so that we might imagine more just
possibilities of engagement; (3) To enact practices of justice and freedom
rooted in and animated by discerning critique.
As an anchoring intellectual disposition, critical diversity signals a
perspective on =E2=80=9Cdiversity=E2=80=9D that goes beyond that term=E2=80=
=99s common yoking with
=E2=80=9Cinclusion=E2=80=9D to reflect on access to resources, to define prob=
lems and
establish alliances, and to address actual systems of domination and
oppression. The digital humanities can offer powerful tools for analysis,
including various forms of digital reading, digital archives, data
visualization, and electronic literature. Our initiative understands that
these tools are not neutral, but must be interrogated, analyzed, and
engaged through an abiding commitment to critical diversity.
In this first of a two-phase cluster hire, we seek applications from
creative, energetic, and empathetic scholars at the Associate or Full
Professor level with a demonstrated record of leadership, achievement, and
mentoring who will help further frame, develop, and support our Critical
Diversity in a Digital Age initiative.
