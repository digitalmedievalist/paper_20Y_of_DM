has anyone experience about how to use TEI to encode phonemic (and
possibly phonetic) information in a text transcription? Also I would
love to hear from people not using TEI for this purpose, I know there
exist several software suitable for text analysis and classification
(f.i. I've been pointed to this one:
http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/).A couple of examples:1. fallan
I would like to mark the first 'a' in OE fallan as an /a/ and assign it
to the OAngl dialect.2. giong, geong, gong
These are all graphical variants of an initial /jo/ diphtong, with
geo- and gio- being graphical conventions to point to a palatal
pronunciation of initial g.After the encoding is done the goal is to recover statistical
information (via XSLT or specific sw analysis) about the percentages of
dialect tracts in a text, so to draw conclusions about its origin, date,
etc.Thanks in advance.	RRDT-- Roberto Rosselli Del Turco      roberto.rossellidelturco at unito.it
