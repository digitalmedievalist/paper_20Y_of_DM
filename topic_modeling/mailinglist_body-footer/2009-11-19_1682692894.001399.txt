Dan, the thing is that *this is something that neither the TEI, nor
DM, nor any other conference or scholarly organization can possibly
control*. If in the future the TEI or DM don't advertise or encourage
people to use the feeds (that is, mark their tweets with hash tags),
some people are going to do it anyway, and there will be these public
conversations whether the presenters, or the conference organizers,
like it or not. If someone is going to say, well I can't present at
that conference because someone might be snarky about me on a Twitter
feed... well, I'm not sure how the conference organizers can possibly
respond to that. Ban Twitter? The best approach may be to make it
clear that the feed is not "official" conference discussion and that
participants in the feed are solely responsible for their own
comments. It's clear that that is not obvious at this point.Dot
