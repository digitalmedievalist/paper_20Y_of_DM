short papers and application notes by one week - you now have until May 
28 (11:59pm AoE) to get your submissions in. So, if you have unpublished 
research work related to document engineering, now is a good time to 
consider submitting to DocEng 2015.This year's DocEng will take place from September 8-11, 2015 at the 
Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland.We will also have a doctoral consortium for PhD students, ProDoc(a)DocEng, 
to present their research in progress and obtain constructive feedback 
from more senior members of the audience. Submissions are also due on 
May 28. More information will follow shortly.You can find the Call for Papers here:

Doctoral Consortium will be eligible to apply for an ACM SIGWEB Student 
Travel Award.For more information, please visit the conference website at:
