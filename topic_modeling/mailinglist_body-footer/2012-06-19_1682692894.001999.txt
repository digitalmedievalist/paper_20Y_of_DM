builtin magnifier is a terrific addition to any website using MSS, older 
printed matter, and individual illustrations where detail is necessary 
or merely nice.  The magnifier does, however, depend on available 
high-definition images, so perhaps a two-step interface may be 
necessary, as with the set of 1,230 TIFF page images I want to make 
available with a transcription of Hall's Chronicle (1550):  thumbnails 
clickable to full page images, with magnifier.  Sounds idea.  Now I just 
have to figure out if I can do it before the end of time.Cheers,
