Jeanette Patterson (University of Virginia) Digital environments enable our studying and representing texts and
manuscripts in radically enhanced ways. As a result, not only have
traditional practices been perfected, also new concepts and forms-such as
those of a "digital edition," a "digital library," and a "digital
archive"-are now giving stimulus to new theories and critical approaches. In
this session, we seek to promote discussion around how digital environments
are changing our examination and representation of texts and the codices
that contain them. We invite submissions that reflect on the achievements,
challenges, and prospects of manuscript and textual studies in the digital
medium, including, but not limited to: * manuscript representation technologies* theories of digital edition or the making of digital editions* corpora studies and computational approaches to manuscript studies* the goals of textual studies in a digital environment* examples of manuscript and textual studies carried out in online
environments Please send a 100-word abstract and Participant Information Form to Albert
Lloret at lloret(a)umass.edu by September 15.    Albert Lloret, PhD
