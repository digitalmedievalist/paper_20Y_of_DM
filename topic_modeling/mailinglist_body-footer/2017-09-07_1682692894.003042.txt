Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printableSponsored by Digital Philology: A Journal of Medieval CulturesOrganized by Albert Lloret (University of Massachusetts Amherst) and Jeanette=
 Patterson (Binghamton University, SUNY)The prevalent use of digital tools and online environments to edit medieval t=
exts is resulting in a myriad of projects in which unique solutions are deplo=
yed to offer optimal representations of very different textual objects. Singl=
e manuscripts, library collections, authorial corpora, and works preserved in=
 several witnesses, for instance, all beg for different editorial and archiva=
l approaches. The possibilities for study and representation, in addition, ar=
e multiplied not only by the technologies employed or designed ad hoc for eac=
h project, but also by the scholars' ideas on the very nature of what=
 is being studied. We invite paper submissions that reflect on the theory, de=
velopments, and challenges of editing and archiving medieval texts, including=
, but not limited to:=E2=80=A2theories of digital edition.
=E2=80=A2the making of digital editions.
=E2=80=A2technologies employed in the making of digital archives.
