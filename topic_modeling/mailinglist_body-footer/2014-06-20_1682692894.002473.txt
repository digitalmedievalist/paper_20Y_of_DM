positions to its Executive Board. Board positions are for two year terms
and incumbents may be re-elected (for a maximum of three terms in a row).
Members of the Board are responsible for the overall direction of the
organisation and leading the Digital Medievalist's many projects and
programmes. This is a working board, and so it would be expected that you
are willing and able to commit time to helping Digital Medievalist
undertake some of its activities: the Board is currently organised with a
Director, a Deputy Director, a Journal Editor-in-Chief, Journal Associate
Editors, Conference Reprensentatives, Website and News Feed Admins DM-L
Admins, Facebook Admin, Infrastructure/Technical Support, Returning
Officers for ElectionsFor further information about the Executive and Digital Medievalist more
generally pleasesee the DM website, particularly:-  http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/about/

elections. In order to be eligible for election, candidates must be members
of Digital Medievalist (membership is conferred simply by subscription to
the organisation's mailing list, dm-l) and have made some demonstrable
contribution either to the DM project (e.g. to the mailing list, or the
wiki, etc.), or generally to the field of digital medieval studies.If you are interested in running for these positions or are able to
recommend a suitable candidate, please contact the returning officers, Ben
Albritton (blalbrit(a)stanford.edu) and Dominique Stutzmann (
dominique.stutzmann(a)irht.cnrs.fr), who will treat your nomination or
enquiries in confidence. The nomination period will close at 2359 UTC on
Mon June 30 and elections will be held by electronic ballot through the
whole of the week starting  7 July, 2014.Best wishes,
Ben Albritton and Dominique Stutzmann--===============8484320479729233075==
