Scholarship, we would like to invite you to submit an essay for the
fifteenth edition of our journal. Variants (
https://journals.openedition.org/variants/275) is an Open Access,
peer-reviewed journal, published with Open Edition publishers. The
fifteenth issue of the journal will carry the title of our most recent ESTS
conference in MÃ¡laga: "Textual Scholarship in the 21st Century", and we
especially welcome extended versions of papers that were presented at the
conference. But essays outside of the conference are welcome too, on any
aspect of textual scholarship such as the theories and practices of
(digital) scholarly editing, tool development, genetic criticism,
codicology and palaeography, philology, manuscript studies, etc.If you are interested in submitting an essay, please send an expression of
interest by *Friday January 10th* that includes a brief description of the
essay's topic (approximately 50 to 100 words) to
variants(a)textualscholarship.eu. Full papers are due by Friday March 13,
2020.We accept submissions in .docx and its open source equivalents. For authors
who are comfortable writing in LaTeX, we have prepared a template that is
available on GitHub (https://github.com/WoutDLN/variantx-for-authors) and
as an Overleaf template (
https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/submission-template-to-
variants-for-authors/znsqffgrvshv).Please share this call with anyone who may be interested. If you have any
further questions, please do not hesitate to forward them to us!We look forward to receiving your submissions,
The Editorial board of Variants,
General Editor, Wout Dillen
Associate Editor, Elli Bleeker
