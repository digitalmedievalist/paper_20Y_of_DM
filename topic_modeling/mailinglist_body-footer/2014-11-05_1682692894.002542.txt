a - DiXiT Marie Curie Network: The Scholarly Digital Edition and the Humaniti=
es. Theoretical approaches and alternative tools.
The event will be held at DigiLab La Sapienza, Rome, 3-5 December 2014. Vetre=
ria Sciarra =E2=80=93 Via dei Volsci 122, 00185 RomaRoom 110
The aim of this workshop is to present a critical approach to the digital rep=
resentation of textual artefacts in the context of Humanities and Social Scie=
nces. While the imperatives of digitization are affecting at a global level o=
ur cultural organizations and institutions, it seems necessary to introduce a=
 socio-cultural reflection into the realm of the scholarly digital edition. T=
he workshop is organized in practical and theoretical sessions led by Desmond=
 Schmidt (Queensland University of Technology), Paolo Monella (Universit=C3=
=A0 di Palermo) e Domenico Fiormonte (Universit=C3=A0 Roma Tre). Participants=
 will be guided through the realization of a digital product, experimenting w=
ith some innovative digital editions tools and platforms.=20
The workshop is open to all students registered for postgraduate and doctoral=
 programs (PhD or equivalent) anywhere in the world working in the field of D=
igital Humanities and Social Sciences. Some basic experience in scholarly edi=
ting and textual criticism is recommended. Attendance is free of charge, but =
registration is required for all applicants. Twelve positions are reserved fo=
r DiXiT fellows. The format of the workshop is multicultural, i.e. participan=
ts and speakers will be free to speak in their mother tongue or instead use E=
nglish as lingua franca. All teaching material will be translated in English,=
 except original cultural artifacts. Given the practical nature of the worksh=
op we can accommodate up to 25 participants. =20
