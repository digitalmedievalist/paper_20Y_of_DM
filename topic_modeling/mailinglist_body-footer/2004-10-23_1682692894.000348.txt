	Does anybody know of an adaptable auto-install program that would 
install fonts when a CD is loaded? I'm looking for something that 
ideally would be open source, work equally well in most environments 
(e.g. Win, Mac, Linux). Its main function would be to install a font a 
project needs and, if possible, start a web-page up in the user's 
default browser.
