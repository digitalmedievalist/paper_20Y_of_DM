a database (e.g. mysql) and then some scripts of some sort (say PHP)
to allow users to query the database.2)You could plop it in an XML database (e.g. eXist) and design a basic
XQuery to allow users to do a free-text search. (Or something more
complicated).  If you use this solution then exporting not as HTML,
but as CSV or something and then converting that to more intricate XML
would be a better way.3)By far the easiest is to make your HTML attractive to a third-party
search engine, and allow google to search and index it.  Then, you can
embed a search box which searches just your site by including
something like:<form method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search">
<div style="border:1px solid black;padding:4px;width:20em;">
<input type="text"   name="q" size="25" maxlength="255" value="" />
<input type="submit" value="Google Search" /></td></tr>
<input type="checkbox"  name="sitesearch" value="DOMAIN-NAME-HERE"
checked /> only search DOMAIN-NAME-HERE<br />
</div>
</form>Obviously changing the two 'DOMAIN-NAME-HERE' to be your site for your
site.  For example changing 'DOMAIN-NAME-HERE' to
'sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php' would make the box search only the
Digital Medievalist wiki.Of course this isn't flawless. Google follows particular rules when
indexing pages.Unless you are looking to put in a fair bit of time and effort, I
would suggest the third option.-JAmes--===============4139790279629771914==--
