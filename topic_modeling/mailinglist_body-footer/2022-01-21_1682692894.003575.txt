 and Networks in the Humanities 2022. Originally planned as an event in Amste=
rdam, the conference has been forced by the ongoing circumstances of the pand=
emic to move online. Although this was of course regrettable, we hope that th=
e move will pay off by allowing many more interested colleagues to participat=
e!Registration for the conference is possible on https://graphentechnologien.hy=
potheses.org. This page provides access to the programme and the abstracts. R=
egistration will also grant access to the Perusall platform where the abstrac=
ts have been published in advance for comment and feedback from participants.With best wishes,
