courseware CMS so has features for the overall design of sites, enrolment of
students, etc. but also course-level modules for: assignments, chatting, voti=
ng,
forums, glossaries, lessons, quizzes, resource delivery, surveys, wikis,
workshops, etc. etc.See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Features.Moreover, those of you using ubuntu or debian linux who have TEI package
repository in your sources list (see http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/teideb/ ) can j=
ust
'sudo apt-get install moodle' to get it installed and set up.Best,
