Streamed live and archived at <https://youtu.be/bmtXDQBm2OI>This paper will present the findings of a Leverhulme-funded project exploitin=
g the rich body of epigraphic data from the Iberian Peninsula to explore popu=
lation movement in the region in the first two centuries AD. Working with a d=
atabase of over 500 inscriptions, the project maps inscriptions in order to e=
nable better visualisation and closer analysis of the epigraphic data. The pa=
per will demonstrate an important new open-access resource, consisting of a s=
earchable online database and an interactive map of population movement withi=
n (and beyond) the Iberian Peninsula, as well as setting out the methodology =
and some of the benefits and limitations of the approaches taken.ALL WELCOME=3D=3D
