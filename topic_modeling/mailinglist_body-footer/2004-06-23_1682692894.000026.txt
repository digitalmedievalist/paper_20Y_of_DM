can't tell for certain, but might it be that you haven't specified 
Junicode in the font menu in the Character Palette? The runes display 
fine there when I do, but they show up as boxes if the palette is set 
at a font that doesn't include those glyphs. I'm running Mac OS 
10.2.8, which may or may not make a difference.They also seem to work fine in TextEdit and Mellel [[2]].What a lovely and useful font!John[[1]] http://www.microsoft.com/mac/default.aspx?pid=office2004td[[2]] http://www.redlers.com/
