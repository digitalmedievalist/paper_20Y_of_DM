ed to announce the Samuel H. Kress Foundation Graduate Fellowship in Digital =
Art History. The fellowship for $30,000 will help to offset the cost for an e=
ntering student in our Masters (MA) program in Digital Art History and Comput=
ational Media. The fellowship is specifically meant for populations of studen=
ts often underrepresented in digital art history including people of color, f=
irst generation college students, and women. Duke is an ideal institution to =
receive this specialized intellectual training to prepare the student for suc=
cess in rigorous PhD programs in art history and visual studies. For full det=
ails on the program see https://aahvs.duke.edu/graduate/MA-historical-cultura=
l-visualization.Through this fellowship we intend to help diversify our field and to develop =
sophisticated, and rigorous computational work. Our MA is specifically target=
ed to address art historical questions in conjunction with area computational=
 and cultural specialists at Duke.The Samuel H. Kress Foundation has made extraordinary contributions in the la=
st decade to the support of new digital art history initiatives. This Kress G=
raduate Fellowship fosters and strengthens the connection between art histori=
cal research and the broader field of Digital Humanities. It builds off of th=
e tested curriculum of the MA in Digital Art History & Computational Media wh=
ile guiding the student to future success in an art history and visual studie=
s PhD.Our goals are:1) To increase the opportunities of underrepresented populations for particip=
ation in Digital Humanities2) To improve the chances of MA art historians to enter a high-level art hist=
ory and visual studies PhD program or succeed in digital areas once they are =
in such a program, especially to prepare them for university careers3) To strengthen the diversity of art history as a discipline4) To expand digital art history as a subfieldCandidates who would like to be considered for this opportunity should apply =
to the MA in Digital Art History & Computational Media and express their expl=
icit interest in their application for pursuing advanced work in an art histo=
ry and visual studies PhD program.For questions, contact paul.jaskot(a)duke.edu<mailto:paul.jaskot(a)duke.edu?s=
