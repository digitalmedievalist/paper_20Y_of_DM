ge, 1-8 June 2022, to improve Artificial Intelligence driven text recognition=
 from Greek papyri and Byzantine manuscripts! - An AI crowd challenge organis=
ed by the Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities (VeDPH), Ca' Foscar=
i University of Venice. See: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/htrec-2022Handwritten text recognition (HTR) concerns the conversion of scanned images =
of handwritten text into machine-encoded text. This is a challenging task tha=
t can lead to transcribed text with multiple errors or even to no transcripti=
on at all when training data (e.g., on a specific script) are not available. =
This challenge aims to post-correct automatically any HTR transcription error=
s, attempting to build on recent NLP advances, such as on Grammatical Error C=
orrection.Why Is This Challenge Important?New, unpublished data will be released with this challenge and the state of t=
he art in the field will be drawn. A workshop, that will take place in Venice=
 in November
2022, will discuss the results.What is the dataset like?The training instances consist of images of handwritten texts that have been =
transcribed by human experts (the ground truth) and by a state of the art HTR=
 model (the input). The texts comprise Greek papyri and byzantine manuscripts=
. First, more than 1,800 lines of transcribed text will be released in order =
to serve as training and validation data. The use of other resources for trai=
ning is allowed and suggested. Next, an evaluation set will be released, for =
which we will only share the input. A very small part of the evaluation set i=
s used to keep an up to date leaderboard.What Are The Key Tasks?The task involves the correction of any errors present in the HTR-ed text, pr=
ovided the system transcription of the manuscript in question. The ground tru=
th of the evaluation set is used to score participating systems in terms of c=
haracter error *reduction* rate (CERR). A starter kit notebook is  provided h=
ere  to assist with system development and evaluation.Prizes!The Participant with the best performing system will be invited to attend a w=
orkshop in Venice, upon the completion of the challenge, and present the resp=
ective system description paper with all expenses covered.TimelineTraining data release date: May 1st, 2022
Evaluation data release date: June 1st, 2022
Predictions submission deadline: 11:59, June 8th, 2022
Rankings release date: July 1st, 2022
System description paper submission deadline: 11:59 September 1st, 2022
Best system description paper announced: October 1st, 2022
Workshop: November 7th & 8th, 2022, Venice, ItalyAll deadlines are in UTC -12h timezone (anywhere on planet earth).Best of luck!
