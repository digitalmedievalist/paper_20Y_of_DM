on the http://lingo.dcf.uvic.ca:8080/exist/graves/index.xml URL. 
http://lingo.dcf.uvic.ca does say 'PHP works' also to me. I usually do
not have problems connecting to any portnumber. Very very odd indeed.

from
different places, and just cannot get through.  I get 'the operation
timed
out when trying to connect to..' or just 'cannot connect to..'
I am trying 
http://lingo.dcf.uvic.ca:8080/exist/graves/index.xml
When I try just http://lingo.dcf.uvic.ca I get the cryptic 'PHP
works'.
ON the face of it, it looks like something to do with port 8080.  And
checking, I discover..
  1. I do not seem able to connect to any sites with 8080
  2.  But can connect to: 8000, 8081, etc
  3.  There is nothing in the settings in this computer which appears
to bar
access to any ports 8080.  Netstat does not show anything running on a
8080
So very odd indeed
Anyone else see this behaviour?
