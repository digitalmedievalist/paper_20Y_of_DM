edition of Kopka and Daly and found no entry in the index under 
Unicode. The even more recent second edition of _The Latex Companion_ 
is a little better (check the index under "UTF-8"; there's still no 
"Unicode" entry), but the situation is still pretty sketchy from what 
I understand. LaTeX & Unicode will in theory work with the characters 
in [inputenc] encodings (e.g., Latin 1 and Latin 2), and there's 
support for CKJ with the difficult-to-set-up [ucs] package, but it's 
not as easy nor complete as it seems like it should be after all 
these years - a constant refrain about fonts in general on the TeX 
lists, by the way.Progress does seem to be being made, though; see e.g. the TUGboat 
EuroTeX 2003 Proceedings Table of Contents:http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents24-3.htmlYou might also find parts of the 2005 Conference Preprints .pdf 
useful (4.6 MB; linked at:)http://www.dante.de/dante/events/eurotex/I'm far from an expert, but you might want to look into (and ask on 
the lists for) Aleph and Omega:http://www.ntg.nl/mailman/listinfo/alephhttp://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/omegaIf by chance you haven't tried it already, the newsgroup 
news:comp.text.tex might be worth approaching, or one of the archived 
search results at Google Groups:http://groups-beta.google.com/using the search string:unicode xml group:comp.text.texmight prove useful. The first result that comes up looks at first 
glance particularly promising.If you're not wedded to LaTeX2e, you might consider one of its 
cousins, the cutting-edge cross-platform implementation of TeX called 
ConTeXt:http://www.pragma-ade.com/http://contextgarden.net/Main_PageSee for the Unicode side:http://contextgarden.net/Encodings_and_Regimesand for the XML side:http://contextgarden.net/XMLConTeXt also has a very active mailing list:http://www.ntg.nl/mailman/listinfo/ntg-context From what I've gathered from discussions on that mailing list, almost 
anything you can do in LaTeX you can also do in ConTeXt; often if if 
something is not currently possible, the developers will come up with 
a solution and incorporate it in the next minor update a month or two 
down the road. The user (and developer) base is much smaller than for 
LaTeX and there are no (!) books and the documentation is not always 
as helpful as one might want, but the recent founding of ConTeXt 
Garden has helped make the implementation a good deal more 
intelligible than it was, say, a year ago.Alternatively, if switching to Mac OS X is an option, bleeding-edge 
(so-called by its main developer, Jonathon Kew) XeTeX:http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=xetexis platform-specific but allows you to use any fonts in the system 
without having to generate new files, name them in special & esoteric 
ways, and put them in the right place - the kind of thing that tends 
to drive new users of LaTeX back to WYSIWYG. Note also the link to 
the active XeTeX mailing list at the above page.Sorry not to be of more specific help, but I hope these will provide 
some leads to those who can offer better assistance.John
