Expressions
================================================================
Date: 1-2 December 2016
Place: An Foras Feasa, Maynooth University, IrelandOverview
------------
The aim of this two-day symposium is to bring together experienced and
early-stage researchers to engage with the versioning of cultural objects.
The version of a cultural object is identified, articulated, and analysed
through diverse mechanisms in different fields of study. The study of
versions allows for the investigation of the creative processes behind the
conception of the object, a closer inspection of the socio-political
contexts that affect it, and may even provide the means to investigate the
provenance and the object’s circulation. The symposium will provide a
platform for scholars from different research areas  to exchange ideas
across different forms of media, including  text, image, and sound. The
proposed symposium considers the term “versioning” in the broadest sense;
while the understanding of versions differ in disciplines, this dialogue
will explore  the convergences and variances in its conception. The
conversation will  highlight  the range and depth of existing studies  and
provide an inter-disciplinary understanding of the term.
The symposium will focus on three primary areas:
•         What is a version?
•         Methods used  in the electronic modelling of versions of cultural
objects
•         The representation of these digital versionsApplication Process
--------------------------
Proposals of up to 500 words are invited by 15 August 2016 from any
disciplinary area which engage with either theoretical or practical
applications of versioning. The symposium aims to challenge existing silos
of disciplinary knowledge providing a platform for dialogue and debate,
creating  a more coherent understanding of the subject. We welcome
applications from Irish, European, and international researchers  and
applications are welcome from both project-based and theoretical research.
In particular, we encourage students and graduates of the Irish Digital
Arts and Humanities (DAH) PhD Programme to apply.Abstracts should be sent to the organisers by 15 August 2016
To: Vinayak.dasGupta(a)nuim.ie; roman.bleier(a)uni-graz.atAreas may include, but are not limited to:
Textual studies, Variorum editions and collation methods, Musicology,

---------
The symposium will be limited to 12 participants who will be selected based
on a short abstract. Upon selection, participants will be asked to submit
an extended abstract of 3000 words or a draft paper (no more than 8000
words) by 31 October 2016, which will be circulated to symposium
participants in advance. The working paper will then be presented and
discussed at the symposium. Additionally, every participant will be asked
to read two working papers in advance of the symposium, review and prepare
questions and comments for the authors. Completed articles will be
considered for publication in an edited volume after the symposium.Deadlines
