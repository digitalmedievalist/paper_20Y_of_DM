> Many of you know that in addition to my day job, I have a weird hobby of ma=
king fonts for medievalists. This one is a little bit later than the Middle A=
ges, but may still be of interest.
>=20
> I have just released a font called "Joscelyn," which I call "an uncompromis=
ing secretary hand font" because, unlike any other secretary hand font I have=
 seen, it makes no concessions to modernity. It is based on the main hand of =
Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, MS 488, John Joscelyn's Historiola Collegi=
i Corporis Christi. The hand (not Joscelyn's own) is rather formal, and so le=
ss difficult than many secretary hands, but it is as near as I've been able t=
o come so far to an authentic reproduction of the hand.
>=20
> When I teach paleography, the most difficult bit for my students is always =
the last--secretary hand. The idea behind this font is that a decent way to l=
earn this difficult hand might be to (1) install the font, (2) start a Micros=
oft Word file by double-clicking an included template, (3) apply the "Joscely=
n" character style, (4) type whatever you like, and (5) just observe. The aut=
henticity of the font depends on seveal OpenType features being enabled, but =
the template turns them on for you.
>=20
> At the risk of sounding immodest, I have to say that it's fun to type in th=
is font and see the OpenType features applied in real time--s changed into lo=
ng s, initial and final forms applied, and much more. And in addition, you ca=
n pass as much time as you like playing with the font without running the sma=
llest risk of contracting COVID-19!
