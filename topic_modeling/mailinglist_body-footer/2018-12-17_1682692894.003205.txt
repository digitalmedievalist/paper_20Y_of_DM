for reviews for a special issue of the journal RIDE, dedicated to Tools 
and Environments for Digital Scholarly Editing (DSE):
https://www.i-d-e.de/cfr-tools/To guide reviewers through the review process and to create a structure 
for the evaluation, we provide Criteria for Reviewing Digital Tools and 
Environments for DSE that are supposed to be applicable to various types 
of resources. The guidelines (Version 1.0) can be found here:
https://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-tools-version-1/Reviews will be accepted until the 31st of May 2019.We kindly ask you to email us before start reviewing a tool at 
ride-tools (at) i-d-e.de with a suggestion of which resource you would 
like to review and with a short explanation of your affiliation and area 
of expertise. This is important in order to avoid multiple reviews of 
the same tool.BackgroundIn the introduction to his book Software takes command (Bloomsbury 
Publishing, 2013) Lev Manovich states that "software has become our 
interface to the world, to others, to our memory and our imagination". 
Is the same happening in the world of digital scholarly editing? 
Certainly we cannot ignore their fundamental role in our daily scholarly 
practices and in the interactions with our objects of study. Insofar as 
tools shape scholarly editions, they also shape scholarly editing.A new RIDE issue is devoted to tools for digital scholarly editing. The 
aim of this issue is to:  * contribute to the discussion about tooling in Digital Humanities,
  * bring to the forefront the instruments instead of the final products,
  * provide a venue for discussing best practices in the development and
    usage of tools,
  * list useful resources for all those involved in scholarly editing.Beyond that, we hope that the critical examination of digital tools 
draws greater attention to the (scholarly) achievements that their 
creation and maintenance imply.The journal RIDE was founded in 2014 to "provide a forum in which expert 
peers criticise and discuss the efforts of digital editors in order to 
improve current practices and advance future developments" (RIDE 
Editorial). RIDE is Open Access, reviews are published as HTML and 
downloadable as TEI. All reviews will be peer reviewed in order to reach 
a high quality level of the evaluations. The special issue on Digital 
Tools and Environments for DSE will be edited by Anna-Maria Sichani 
(University of Sussex) and Elena Spadini (University of Lausanne).
Submission detailsReviews are accepted in English, French, Italian, and Spanish. The 
length of the review can vary depending on how much the resource offers 
that is worthy of discussion (approximately 2000-5000 words).Please submit your review at ride-tools (at) i-d-e.deÂ  as an editable 
text file (preferably, but not necessarily docx to facilitate the 
conversion to TEI). Please send illustrations as separate image files 
(jpg or png) and leave a note in the text as a placeholder for each 
image. In addition to the text, we collect keywords. Each review should 
be accompanied by a short abstract in English, independently of the 
language used in the main text.For further information please check the general RIDE guidelines and 
information on writing and submitting:
http://ride.i-d-e.de/reviewers/guidelines/
http://ride.i-d-e.de/reviewers/writing-and-submitting/The questionnaire mentioned in the submission checklist has been 
designed for scholarly digital editions so far. We will keep you 
informed about how to proceed with the questionnaire for this special issue.All reviews will be peer reviewed in order to reach a high quality level 
of the evaluations. We believe that this is important because the 
evaluation of digital scholarly resources usually requires a double 
expertise in digital methods as well as in individual disciplines. This 
is also to increase the credit for reviews.
