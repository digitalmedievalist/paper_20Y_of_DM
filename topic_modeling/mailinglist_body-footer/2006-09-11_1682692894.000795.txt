but I think it is just as pertinant for this list (though the objects
initially being worked with are "classical" the technology will be no
less relevant for newer artifacts). The EDUCE project is a
collaborative effort between computer scientists at University of
Kentucky and Iowa State and classicists at the University of Kentucky.Dot---------- Forwarded message ----------

To: DIGITALCLASSICIST(a)jiscmail.ac.uk
We've gathered some information pertinent to the recently announced
U.S. National Science Foundation award to EDUCE (Enhanced Digital
Unwrapping for Conservation and Exploration) herehttp://www.stoa.org/educe/As data and results emerge from the project, our current plans are to
make them available at this site (or to link to their whereabouts
elsewhere as the case may be).RossPS: we've already made preliminary plans to work with certain relevant
artifacts, of course, but further suggestions for objects of inquiry
from any Digital Classics subscribers would always be welcome, and
gratefully received.
