entitled "Medievalists' Use of Electronic Resources," which surveyed a
selected group of medievalists on faculty at universities across the US on
their use of and attitudes towards electronic resources (
http://ils.unc.edu/MSpapers/2807.pdf). The survey asked faculty how they
preferred to access various different types of resources (journals,
translations, facsimiles, etc.) and attempted to gauge preferences for using
digital resources across the community (junior faculty vs. chaired faculty,
preferences in different fields, etc.).
Much has changed in the nine years since 2002. Google Books was first
introduced in 2004. ACLS released its final report on Cyberinfrastructure,
"Our Cultural Commonwealth" in 2006. The NEH, which had long supported
digital projects, awarded the first Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants in
2007, and founded the Office of Digital Humanities in 2008. In medieval
studies, more and more digital resources are released every year, there is
an established community of "Digital Medievalists", and the International
Congress on Medieval Studies has had a steady growth in the number and
profile of presentations and events on issues relating to digitization.
Digital resources in the medieval studies are ubiquitous. Are they being
used?
Now is the perfect time to return to this project, to undertake the survey
again, and to see just how (or if) attitudes and use have changed over the
past nine years. Looking forward, this research can help resource developers
design projects to best serve their audiences.This message serves as an open invitation to participate in this research
project. Any medievalist at any level is welcome to participate.
Participation involves filling in an online survey, located at the link
below. It should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.

This study is completely confidential and I will report only aggregated
results in any published articles. If you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to contact me at dot.porter(a)gmail.com.
Thank you for taking the time to help me with this research project.
Sincerely,
Dot Porter, MA, MSLS
