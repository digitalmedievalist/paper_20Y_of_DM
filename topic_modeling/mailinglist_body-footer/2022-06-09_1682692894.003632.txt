ong-term regional study of the relationships between peoples and their cultur=
es and the environment in the region that is now southern Burgundy, France. W=
e have, using an inherently interdisciplinary, even trans-disciplinary approa=
ch, investigated how people interact with the landscape over a period of 2,00=
0 years, from the Iron Age to the present day. We have brought together archa=
eologists, historians, ecologists, geologists and more, focusing on how peopl=
es both influence and are influenced by their environment using the approach =
of Historical Ecology. I have focused much of my part of this larger, on-goin=
g work on the application of advanced technologies to such regional and tempo=
ral studies. These include historical cartography, aerial photography and rem=
ote sensing, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (like the U.S. GPS), digital=
 data archiving, and the integration of disparate data derived from many sour=
ces in our long-standing Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I see GIS as a=
n integrative context where the data from many research disciplines and appro=
aches can be both stored and analyzed, displayed and shared.We have found that our Historical Ecology approach to this work allows us to =
bring together disciplinary approaches, data, and perspectives, and to synthe=
size these in ways that are not possible within any single discipline or suit=
e of technologies. I am also a very strong proponent of Free and Open Source =
(FOSS) software, and the great majority of our technical work is done using o=
pen source tools that can be freely shared, modified, and adapted.ALL WELCOME=E2=80=8B
