My university library has recently subscribed to a program called 
Refworks which is similar to ProCite and EndNote, but runs on line. I 
have only begun exploring its capabilities, but it claims to allow 
you to share your bibliography on-line once it is generated. If your 
institution doesn't have a subscription, individuals can sign up for 
US$100/year.www.refworks.comIs anyone else familiar with this product and its limitations?Jesse
