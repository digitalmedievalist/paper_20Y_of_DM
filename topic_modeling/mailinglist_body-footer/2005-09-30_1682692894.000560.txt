devoted to a linux desktop publishing program:
> Are there any Linux font editors?

> I may need something to make a font. A serious font for linguistics

> features such as ligatures, various dashes, etc., so the font can be 
> used for publishing books).

> Fontlab seems to be the reigning monarch in the Win/Mac world. 
> What is the best font editor currently available in the Linux world?-dan
