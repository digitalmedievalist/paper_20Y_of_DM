or the Digital Humanities at the University of Pennsylvania, the Schoenberg I=
nstitute for Manuscript Studies (SIMS) is sponsoring a course on Linked Data =
for the Humanities<http://web.sas.upenn.edu/dream-lab/2018/09/12/linked-data-=
for-the-humanities/>, with Kevin Page and David Lewis, both from the e-Resear=
ch Centre at Oxford University. The course will be held June 10-14, 2019, in =
the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books, and Manuscripts at Pen=
n.Thanks to funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services in suppor=
t of the SIMS-affiliated Mapping Manuscript Migrations<http://mappingmanuscri=
ptmigrations.org/> project, a T-AP Digging Into Data Award recipient, FULL TU=
ITION SCHOLARSHIPS are available for students and early career scholars and p=
rofessionals.Here's a summary of the course:"This course introduces the concepts and technologies behind the Semantic Web=
 and teaches attendees about the standards and practices that underpin Linked=
 Data. Sessions offer a mix of "under the hood" technical details explaining =
how Linked Data ticks, alongside examples of applied Linked Data from the pre=
senters' own humanities research. Through consideration of these varied uses =
across the humanities - including musicology, early English literature, and m=
anuscript provenance - attendees will be familiarized with the common pattern=
s by which Linked Data can be applied to their own specialisms. The course wi=
ll culminate in a full day studying a major new digital humanities resource f=
rom the Mapping Manuscript Migrations project, including data from the Schoen=
berg Database of Manuscripts, exploring the end-to-end application of Linked =
Data as a solution for both memory institutions and the researchers using the=
m."For more information and to apply, go to: http://web.sas.upenn.edu/dream-lab/=
