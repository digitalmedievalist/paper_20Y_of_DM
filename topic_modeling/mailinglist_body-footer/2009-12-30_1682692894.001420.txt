problem with the virtual machine that the University of Lethbridge
donates to us and will unfortunately stay down for a few days until
the appropriate support technician returns from the holidays.  The
mailing list is of course unaffected, but journal articles, wiki, and
website are all down probably until the new year sometime.  However,
some of these are available at a temporary mirror of the DM site I've
put up at http://hilda.oucs.ox.ac.uk:8081/ and the news-posting form
at that site should work in case anyone has announcements to submit.I can only apologise for the current problems (not of our making) and
hope the goodwill of those at University of Lethbridge will lead to
the problem being fixed as soon as they return to work.My apologies,
Dr James Cummings
Director, Digital Medievalist
