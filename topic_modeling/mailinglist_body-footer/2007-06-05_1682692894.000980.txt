Seminar, Summer 2007Friday 8th June at 16:30, in room NG16, Senate House, Malet Street, LondonNeel Smith (College of the Holy Cross, MA)
'Digital infrastructure and the Homer Multitext'ALL WELCOMEThe Homer Multitext project is creating digital resources for studying
the Iliad as a textual tradition, including full TEI texts of six MSS,
texts of associated scholia, and new photography of some MSS. This talk
will survey the technological framework for the Multitext project, and
will especially emphasize a tiered design using stable reference schemes
(CTS URNs for text passages, and identifiers with data namespaces for
objects) in conjunction with defined service protocols (Canonical Text
Services, or CTS, for text retrieval, and Collection services for
structured information about objects such as manuscripts).The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.For more information please contact Gabriel.Bodard(a)kcl.ac.uk or
