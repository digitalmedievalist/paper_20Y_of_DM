for people
who wanted an easy to use system without or with little technical 
background. I used
TortoiseSVN (http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) which i think is the 
programm to go for as it is easy to use,
mature and open source. TortoiseSVN is basically a shell extension for 
windows explorer,
so usage should be really straightforward.Best,
Philipp> Hi all,
