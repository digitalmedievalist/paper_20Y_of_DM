Just published the description of fragments in organs:
https://fragmentarium.ms/searchresult/overview/F-2nn5
Perhaps interesting because unusual as host volume. With the group of
students from Erfurt we have created a really funny and very detailed
overall description of this widely used but totally ignored area for
manuscript research.
Please also note the detailed paleographic description in the appendix
as PDF as well as the many other examples of organs with fragments
listed in the image sequences.
