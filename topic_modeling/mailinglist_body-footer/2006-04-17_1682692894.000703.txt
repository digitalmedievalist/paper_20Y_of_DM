fallen already in the public domain. Short information on the EU
"publication right":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_rightGerman law knows an addional right for critical editions with a 25
year term after publication. This is referring to the consolidated
text and not-copyrighted parts like critical apparatus.According to the common law "sweat of the brow" theory it seems
impossible to find a modern scholarly edition which is not copyrighted
(beside of the mentioned protection by the EU "publication right" or
the German protection for critical editions) .I do not accept the theory that it would be an incentive for making
editions if other scholars are not allowed to make fair use of an
other edition. As an OPEN ACCESS advocate I have formulated my request
for OPEN ACCESS to scholarly editions in German in the Vienna
conference papers "Vom Nutzen des Edierens". Available online at:
