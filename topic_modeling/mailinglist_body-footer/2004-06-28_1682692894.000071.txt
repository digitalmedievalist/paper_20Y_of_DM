implementations of what was meant to be an entirely 
platform-independent "standard". very very frustrating, in principle 
and in practice. "java" never really meant "java".>

word is "can". it includes the server resources to handle the load, and 
in such a way that it doesn't affect end-user experience (ie, slow 
loading or server overload errors). to be honest, my argument about a 
smaller niche audience with respect to browsers may apply here, as long 
as your institution has the server resources and bandwidth to give you.>

and not relying on browser-dependent work-arounds.cheers,
