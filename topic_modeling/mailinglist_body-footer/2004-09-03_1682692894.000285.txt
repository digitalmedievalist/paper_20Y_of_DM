Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHello List,At Kzoo next year there are at least three groups sponsoring a total of five
sessions with an electronic focus - Digital Medievalist, the Oxford Text
Archive, and Research in Computing for Humanities. Dan O'Donnell and I were
discussing the problem of market saturation that might come from having so
many similar sessions, and he suggested that we look into organizing a mini
DM conference-within-a-conference for next year's (2006) Kalamazoo Congress.
This would bring together all the various people who regularly organize
digital sessions and sell them to the Congress organizers as a group. The
Institute for Cistercian Studies at Western Michigan has been doing
something similar for years (as long as the Congress itself, I believe) with
great success. I think this is a super idea - what do others think?DotP.S. RCH is still accepting proposals (send them to me at dporter(a)uky.edu);
I'll also put in a word for the OTA (contact James Cummings:
James.Cummings(a)oucs.ox.ac.uk) and the DM (contact Murray McGillivray:
mmcgilli(a)ucalgary.ca), though I don't know if they still have space.
Deadline for submission is the 15 September!--===============4144499643844275214==--
